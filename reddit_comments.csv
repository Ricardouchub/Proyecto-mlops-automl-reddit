nb3shsq,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $113,000, gaining 1.6% despite selling pressure from an 'OG' whale who offloaded 250 BTC ($28.2M) to Binance. Whale activity, including dormant coins, has historically influenced market tops. Analyst Peter Brandt noted this selling trend could signal supply-driven market tops. Meanwhile, retail and institutional accumulation is at its highest since April, suggesting potential for a breakout. However, BTC must reclaim $117,500 to avoid a bearish double-top formation, with weakening U.S. demand adding caution.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

A major Bitcoin whale recently rotated $2 billion worth of BTC into Ether (ETH), triggering a market sell-off and a $45 billion drop in Bitcoin’s market cap. The whale strategically staked ETH and profited $185 million from ETH/BTC trades.

naqu6lv,"> To implement complex programs, such as zero-knowledge verifiers, developers must emulate arithmetic operations using Bitcoin's existing opcodes, which can result in significant program bloat. Although it is technically possible to write a zero-knowledge verifier in Bitcoin's script language, the limited block space renders direct execution of such verifiers infeasible within Bitcoin transactions.  > To overcome these challenges, Bitlayer rollup adopts the BitVM paradigm (specifically, BitVM2), which blends zero-knowledge validity proofs with optimistic fraud proofs into a hybrid proving system. In this model, the prover generates zero-knowledge proofs for layer 2 state transitions, but these proofs are not directly verified on-chain. Instead, they are presumed valid unless challenged through a dispute process. This presumption of validity eliminates the need for costly on-chain verification in the typical ""happy path,"" thereby drastically reducing settlement costs and making Bitcoin rollups a practical solution for scaling.  Edit: Source https://docs.bitlayer.org/docs/Learn/Bitlayer%20Rollup/overview/  Jesus, they made optimistic rollup that uses zero knowledge proofs, just to route around Bitcoins poor script capability.

And the revenue from the fees is capped. They are capped economically.   The only way for Bitcoin to reach a nash equilibrium is to allow miners to decide how many transactions to allow in the blocks, and not a hard coded rule that  cost them fees everytime their are more transactions in the mempool then the code allows space in the blocks.

The more you transact per month, the lower the rate becomes.  From the table above, $40K would put you into the ""Advanced 1"" tier (if you did it all in one month), which is .25/.40 % (maker fee vs taker fee).  You have an option when you place your order whether it is maker or taker, if you're concerned about minimizing fees, just choose the maker option.  In your case, the maker fee will be $100 for $40K, and $160 for the taker.  EDIT: Just did a quick check - apparently CB (at least when giving you the preview) doesn't take the current order into account when calculating what tier you're in, so you wouldn't qualify for the Adv1 tier until you had previously transacted $10K worth.  So to optimize your rates, you'd need to make a $1K order, a $9K order, then finally the remainder of your $30K, but this seems weird to me; it's been a while since I did big orders on CB.  In any case, this is all peanuts compared to the size of your order.

nb9maus,"If 1 BTC = $1,000,000 and you want to retire on it, selling outright is the obvious option, but then you’ve got capital gains tax and you lose the exposure to BTC itself.  Another route is to borrow against your BTC. Basically, you lock up the coin as collateral with a lender (there are crypto platforms and even some traditional finance companies offering this). In return, you can take out a loan in stablecoins or fiat, usually up to 30–50% of the BTC’s value.  Pros:  You get liquidity without triggering a taxable event.  If BTC appreciates, your collateral is worth more.  You can structure the loan to provide regular income (withdraw some, invest in safe yield, etc.).   Cons:  Risk of liquidation: if BTC price drops too much, the lender can sell your BTC to cover the loan.  Interest rates vary a lot depending on platform and risk.  Custody risk: you don’t control the private keys once it’s locked with the lender.   Some people ladder it: keep a portion in cold storage, borrow a conservative % against the rest, then live off the loan proceeds or invest them in safer, income-generating assets.

nb9bdcj,"> what's the best way to transfer my Bitcoin  ...that alone says soo much about not being versed in it. Although I think it's cool that you're taking care of yourself, you should reeeaally read up on what you're doing too.  What is your goal? Transfer for what reason?   Are you trying to store it better? Get a cold wallet like Trezor. Create a wallet in trezor and *understand what you'll be doing with it* before you ""send"" (the up-down arrow button to the right) your Bitcoin to your Bitcoin address in your trezor wallet.  Save your phrase, NEVER LOSE IT...if you plan to keep buying and storing, then repeat the part where you ""send"" your Bitcoin to your trezor.  If your goal is to sell, you can sell from CashApp, or send it to your coinbase Bitcoin address, and then sell it from coinbase.  Depending on how you feel about safety and security, you *can* keep your Bitcoin in CashApp or in coinbase..although not recommended if you plan to trust yourself.

Today price sits slightly below the resistance of the bull channel that dates back to Nov. If we reenter the channel, and find some resistance around 115-116, I could see a flag/pennant form that is loosely bound by channel support and 115-116 resistance. This would lead to compression in the price to around 115.2 at the time of the next Fed meeting before the next major move.

Quantum computers break ECSDA which is the cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions in Bitcoin. Anyway, raw public keys are not used anymore as Bitcoin addresses, now they used a different protocol to produce those addresses which involves ECDSA and hashing functions. Even if someone was able to break ECDSA, your bitcoin would still be safe because no one knows how to invert SHA-256 and quantum computers won't help you to do that, only very old wallets which used raw public keys addresses are in danger",CryptoMarkets,2025-08-29 11:48:49,2

Contributors include Jameson Lopp and Christian Papathanasiou. ￼ 	•	CoinDesk (April 5, 2025) A developer proposed a draft BIP called QRAMP (Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol).

It's not just crypto. It happens in the same way with shares.  Oh, and eggs are good for you. Tomorrow they'll be poisonous. And so on.  Crypto has the extra 'fun' of certain people here on Reddit telling everybody that all crypto is a giant scam and they're fools to be involved.   This isn't a coin that's attracted my attention so I haven't done any research on it, but I'd make these general observations:  1. As we're constantly being told, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. One of the things you can do to manage your risk is to have a diversified portfolio with a range of coins with different purposes. 50% is a lot on a single coin and a lot to lose if things go wrong.  2. Use any advice you're given as a pointer to where to start your own research. I always ask negative questions like ""why has X got such bad press most of the time?"" If all is well you'll struggle to get much feedback. On the other hand if you ask something like ""What's the price of X at the end of the year going to be?"" I bet the 'articles' you find are really advertising copy. That's my experience anyway.  3. Trust your intuition. If your gut says ""NOOOOOO"" listen to it.

nbckdky,"The banks in ASEAN did and have incorporated it into their payments systems through SBI. In fact, LINK was just incorporated into that network a couple of days ago. No bank will rely exclusively on one payment solution. They’ll contract for multiple rails and use whichever is the cheapest transaction by transaction.    The major obstacle was that U.S. banks couldn’t use XRP because of the SEC lawsuit for the past FIVE YEARS. That was a crime, and Ripple certainly lost their first mover advantage (which is what those two corrupt SEC commissioners wanted, Hinman and the other guy, before jumping ship to an ETH-heavy crypto investment firm). Any payment network that excludes the U.S. is hobbled from the get go.   As to RLUSD, stablecoins make much more sense than any crypto in highly liquid markets like USD/GBP or USD/CAD but XRP (or LINK possibly) still would be a cheaper transaction in high friction corridors (i.e. transaction between parties in two countries that doesn’t have a lot of trade between them like Eithiopia to Latvia or something like that).

Never buy a coin without one.  What's the method for how the supply gets distributed?  Avoid coins where insiders are given a ton of their own coin.  **Let's use Bitcoin as an example:**  Total Supply Cap: 21 million coins.  There will never be more than that.  Schedule for how the supply gets released:  50 coins are created and given away to whoever creates the next block on the blockchain, roughly once every ten minutes, starting in January 2009, with the amount being cut in half roughly every four years until a total of 21 million coins have been created.  Method for how the supply gets distributed: Whoever creates the next block on the blockchain wins the block reward.  Zero insider grifter B.S.  **Here's why this stuff matters:**  If you're holding coins with bad tokenomics, you're probably going to end up watching their value go down, down, down.

It’s like building a robot that can “do anything”… as long as you never take it out of the lab. Chainlink is the one actually giving blockchains eyes and ears.  2. **It’s basically the plumbing nobody talks about.**    Everyone loves the flashy Layer 1s and meme coins, but guess what? They’re calling Chainlink in the background to actually function. It’s the boring grown-up in the room making sure DeFi doesn’t collapse every five minutes.  3. **Partnerships everywhere.**    Banks, SWIFT, Google, random DeFi projects you’ve never heard of — yeah, they’re all plugged into Chainlink. But sure, keep betting on your “next 100x” meme token instead.  4. **CCIP is the sleeper weapon.**    Cross-chain interoperability sounds nerdy, but it’s basically the “oh crap” button that makes everything talk to everything else. When chains stop being their own lonely islands, guess who’s running the bridges? Spoiler: not XRP.  5. **It survived multiple bear markets.**    While other projects flatlined or turned into Discord ghost towns, Chainlink kept building. That’s called having actual utility, not just vibes.  6. **And the community?**    Not culty, not screechy — just quietly stacking and letting Sergey Nazarov (the Gandalf of crypto) do wizard things.  👉 So yeah, Chainlink isn’t sexy.

So the lawsuit was great news for us in terms of regulatory clarity (your bullet point)- it held that as a matter of law that XRP is not a security any more, *providing rock solid regulatory clarity*.

nafaylm,"I'll agree that a lot of people are stupid.  But, it takes a lot more than a lack of stupidity to understand the underlying value of something like BTC or ETH. Have you ever tried to explain a block chain to someone? *Can* you explain a blockchain?   What about the concept of trustless? Or, cryptographically secured? Or, decentralized? Or, a distributed ledger?   Can *you* explain why a money supply that doesn't require trust is *good* for society? Can you explain how quantitative easing works and its relationship to BTC? Can *you* explain how the current monetary policy requires trust and how that trust has been betrayed?  You see what I'm saying? These concepts are not easy to wrap you brain around. Shit, the *current* monetary system isn't easy to wrap your brain around. Most people have no idea what QE is, why it's bad, when it's been deployed, how it effects the M2 supply, inflation, and debt. The vast majority of people don't understand the current monetary system. So, trying to get them to understand a new one, like BTC, is even more difficult, because they fail to understand, or are even aware of, the problems with the current monetary system.   If you are speaking to someone who doesn't understand the money supply, M2, and quantitative easing, and how the 2008 financial crisis was 'solved', selling a new monetary policy to them is tricky. To them, BTC/ETH is simply a speculative asset, and nothing more.   Further, its important to remember that the *vast* majority of people you'll ever talk to about this have had the privilege of living in a society that uses the worlds reserve currency, the USD, and who have also had the privilege of being securely banked. So to them, the need to replace the dollar and monetary system isn't readily apparent.   Now, if we go to Argentina, for example, this is a much easier sell, as most people who are alive and working today have experienced a failed currency and hyper inflation. You say to someone in the US ""hey I've got some better money that will hold value in your bank account, want to try it?"" People think you are kind of crazy, especially considering the volatility in the markets. Now, say this to someone who has experienced hyperinflation, and they'll listen up. Its just a difference in perspective. In the US, the degradation of the dollar has been a slow burn, so many people, are numb to it, not stupid.   People aren't stupid, its just that they are living in a different paradigm. If you say to them you've got a replacement for their money, and then show them something that has proven to be extremely volatile, well, that is a tough sell.  And, its not really fair to call someone stupid for not accepting that.",ethtrader,2025-08-24 15:16:00,57

najzmt5,"OP: I'm playing devil's advocate here, because I know Ethereum is a solid project. But many people don't know that yet and Ethereum's marketing until recently was nonexistent. There's a reason why they were not jumping in at low prices.  Buying low only works if the asset has solid fundamentals, marketing, and adoption. People often assume there’s something wrong with an asset if its price crashes significantly, and conversely, they tend to think an asset is “good” when its price is high and rising over a long period.  Take IOTA as an example. Its price surged in late 2017 and early 2018, and many people - including myself - FOMO’d near the all-time highs. However, the price never recovered much after that. It saw a modest increase in 2021 but never reclaimed its previous peak. Does that mean people are foolish for hesitating to buy it now at much lower prices?  For context, I still hold my original IOTA and am staking it, and they improved the project. But I feel like an idiot knowing that I traded 0.47 BTC and 3 ETH for roughly 2,000 IOTA.

You can't blame people for not wanting to ape into a bunch of technobabble nonsense.   Lastly...  >This is your last chance to buy when it is still trading at the 4000s level.  This is a check you can't cash my friend. We will absolutely see ETH in the 3's again, probably even the 2's. Previous two cycles we pulled back 80-90% from the ATH. We only need to pull back 50% to get back into the 2's. We are *far* more likely to see ETH trading hands in the 2's than we are hitting 7k this cycle.",ethtrader,2025-08-24 16:35:27,12

These influencers don't know shit, and they do nothing but influence, for better or worse. And when it doesn't go their way, they vanish.

We saw a long span of negative issuance from the merge up to Dencun. If we compare the inflation of bitcoin from the merge to today, it had a 3.416%/ year inflation. In that same time frame ETH has had a mere 0.132% /year inflation. The goal is that Eth will have a soft cap that an equilibrium will be reached and the supply won’t change much over a longer time frame.

Your also forgetting about staking pools, you can stake any amount of eth with someone like rocket pool (yes I will admit lido is concerning for decentralization) and participate in the rewards. Bitcoin mining is increasingly centralized, even big farms are consolidating because it doesn’t make economic sense and are becoming centralized in areas with cheap power.

n9d0bs5,"99% of security is paid through inflation. Fees have not increased in a meaningful way other than very short non sustaining bursts. This has been true for essentially the entire life of the blockchain. During this time we have had many halving resulting in less issuance and yet the fees have not increased as a percentage of the block rewards meaning the bitcoin value of fees is going down substantially over time. While this is happening we also have diminishing returns in the ATH post having. Let’s just say that the current ATH of 124k (this is actually lower than what the diminishing returns trend projects that number is 128k-132k) is the top of this cycle, this means that if the trend continues the next halving will be the last to have an new ATH arround 200k then price will stagnate close to that price. If you do the math you will find that in 2 halvings the price of bitcoin NEEDS to be $1m just to sustain the network security we have today(which I will also say is 1/10th of the economic security provided by Ethereum under proof of stake). Now let’s say this plays out, Bitcoin stagnates at 200k (1/5th of the price we need to sustain today’s hashrate) the network will be highly vulnerable especially since there is a massive stockpile of asics that have been built up due to over subsidy of the network security.

lu1o0h8,"Why $Horsemeat? It's stable food.  $Horsemeat is nearly a year old, limited supply, originally 10k tokens, as of today (10/27/2024), it is 7,755.85 tokens. How did it decrease? Burnt tokens by the dev, and the purchase of @StudsNFTs burn $Horsemeat supply. Why the limited supply? The creators goal is for 1 token (200lbsHorsemeat) to equal the price of 1 Bitcoin. Crazy idea right!? Well, what would it take for 200lbsHorsemeat to equal say $69k? A market cap of $535,153,650, crazy? A little. Impossible? No. The bull cycle is getting ready to start, many meme coins have reached and will reach incredible market caps in the next 14 months.  The community makes the project, the diamond hooved holders of $Horsemeat have held when the price of 200lbs > 1Sol, the dev held through that as well. Why? Conviction.  Currently $69 a token and under 600k marketcap.

lq68jfg,Kendu is my horse for the bullrun. It is full of multi cycle veterans who understand how to run a coin up. They are familiar with and are comfortable in the crypto market and all of its associated volatility. I have never come across a coin with so little fud. Everyone knows that the retracements are a part of the game.  Speaking of retracements… Kendu has been consolidating for months since Ath. Tokens have redistributed nicely. Someone ran a state a week or so ago that stated over 524B tokens have changed hands since May 29th. The token distribution is super healthy as a result. And diamond handed holders who believe in the long term vision are taking control of the supply.  But memecoins are all about community. And Kendu has formed a cult like following. Cults are going to be the meta this cycle. You need people who believe in a project and want to work for it. To build something long term instead of flipping for a quick gain. The recent 1B Kendu giveaway is a perfect example how how far people are willing to go for Kendu: [https://x.com/\_kevinfinnerty/status/1840794365314134414?s=46&t=v\_u-0xiVcMq4VE4yzPK9sw](https://x.com/_kevinfinnerty/status/1840794365314134414?s=46&t=v_u-0xiVcMq4VE4yzPK9sw)  Kendu is working on building an ecosystem.

This is a ground-floor opportunity to get involved in something before it blows up! * On the other hand, $KENDU is already at an impressive $55M market cap and rising. With the upcoming ShibaCon, there’s speculation that $KENDU could easily push towards $1B as more eyes turn to the project. The timing couldn’t be better.  # Miazaki’s Big Reveal?  Miazaki is set to be a key part of ShibaCon—does that mean we can expect a surprise announcement that could positively affect both $FREAK and $KENDU? With the two Devs on stage together, anything could happen, and we’re expecting big things that will ripple through both projects. If you’re part of the community, you won’t want to miss what’s coming.  # The Trump Factor: Crypto’s Bright Future?  Another piece of the puzzle? Trump’s election as President. With Trump back in office, we’re looking at a massive shift in how crypto is viewed in the United States. The regulatory environment is likely to change in a way that’s very positive for projects like $FREAK and $KENDU. Under Trump’s leadership, crypto could take on a whole new level of importance, potentially opening up massive opportunities.  # Why Now Is the Time for $FREAK  The market cap of $FREAK is still super low compared to the potential it has, especially with its connection to $KENDU and all the exposure both coins are about to get. With ShibaCon just around the corner, this is the perfect moment to join in before the next big wave.  Get ready, fam—this December, we’re taking over Dubai and the crypto world. Let’s FreakOut and push $FREAK and $KENDU to new heights! 🚀🔥  # CAs:  $FREAK: 0xcb43c88c980ff3a2c3f45f125d9886e7aabcd017  $KENDU: 0xaa95f26e30001251fb905d264Aa7b00eE9dF6C18  #",SatoshiStreetBets,2024-11-07 19:20:10,7

ll78bz0,"This is such a good time to get into memecoins, and nothing I see can compare to Kendu.  Timing: the whole market is down, and all the experts are predicting a bull run starting soon (I see a lot of people calling later in sept / oct, then continuing to summer 25). Kendu is sitting at ~60M, having consolidated from 270m, and massively increased holders since then. When the bull run starts, the first pump could certainly hit a billion (and I believe this will be the first of many pumps over the bull run)  The post mentions lots of the reasons that makes Kendu unparalleled. For me, it’s down to community- I want to be working with lots of experienced and dedicated players, and Kendu is the best I’ve seen in this regard   I’m excited for the Kendu future, and have been topping up my Kendu bags while the whole market is down currently",SatoshiStreetBets,2024-09-02 20:26:59,22

ll75s2x,Kendu is the biggest memecoin project launched on Ethereum this year and the Kendu Chads are the biggest NFT mint of this year.
