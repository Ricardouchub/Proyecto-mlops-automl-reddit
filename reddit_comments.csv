nb3shsq,"tldr; Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $113,000, gaining 1.6% despite selling pressure from an 'OG' whale who offloaded 250 BTC ($28.2M) to Binance. Whale activity, including dormant coins, has historically influenced market tops. Analyst Peter Brandt noted this selling trend could signal supply-driven market tops. Meanwhile, retail and institutional accumulation is at its highest since April, suggesting potential for a breakout. However, BTC must reclaim $117,500 to avoid a bearish double-top formation, with weakening U.S. demand adding caution.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

naqu6lv,"> To implement complex programs, such as zero-knowledge verifiers, developers must emulate arithmetic operations using Bitcoin's existing opcodes, which can result in significant program bloat. Although it is technically possible to write a zero-knowledge verifier in Bitcoin's script language, the limited block space renders direct execution of such verifiers infeasible within Bitcoin transactions.  > To overcome these challenges, Bitlayer rollup adopts the BitVM paradigm (specifically, BitVM2), which blends zero-knowledge validity proofs with optimistic fraud proofs into a hybrid proving system. In this model, the prover generates zero-knowledge proofs for layer 2 state transitions, but these proofs are not directly verified on-chain. Instead, they are presumed valid unless challenged through a dispute process. This presumption of validity eliminates the need for costly on-chain verification in the typical ""happy path,"" thereby drastically reducing settlement costs and making Bitcoin rollups a practical solution for scaling.  Edit: Source https://docs.bitlayer.org/docs/Learn/Bitlayer%20Rollup/overview/  Jesus, they made optimistic rollup that uses zero knowledge proofs, just to route around Bitcoins poor script capability.

And the revenue from the fees is capped. They are capped economically.   The only way for Bitcoin to reach a nash equilibrium is to allow miners to decide how many transactions to allow in the blocks, and not a hard coded rule that  cost them fees everytime their are more transactions in the mempool then the code allows space in the blocks.

ETH basically will continue to lower fees as overhead increases to compete with other blockchains that will also race to fees at the lowest possible without wasting resources to spam.

Proof of work is the solution to that problem.   Anyone who thinks POS is a valid system to use for a trustless, permissionless, decentralized money is either intellectually dishonest or hasn't understood the problem being solved and the threat vectors to that solution.

POS of any type fundamentally cannot do that because there's not a trustless way to distinguish the true chain and false ones being presented by bad actors, especially if those bad actors are large stakers.

If for some reason every single Ethereum node goes offline, it is more complicated to recover from than with PoW because PoS relies on having continually online validators.

However, there are thousands of researchers that have spent 10+ years studying blockchains professionally that agree with me on the assessment that this flaw is worth the other benefits of PoS, which is precisely why they chose to switch despite caring deeply about trustlessness. Labeling these people as ""intellectually dishonest"" and ""not having understood the problem"" tells me that YOU are the one who are actually intellectually dishonest.

The more you transact per month, the lower the rate becomes.  From the table above, $40K would put you into the ""Advanced 1"" tier (if you did it all in one month), which is .25/.40 % (maker fee vs taker fee).  You have an option when you place your order whether it is maker or taker, if you're concerned about minimizing fees, just choose the maker option.  In your case, the maker fee will be $100 for $40K, and $160 for the taker.  EDIT: Just did a quick check - apparently CB (at least when giving you the preview) doesn't take the current order into account when calculating what tier you're in, so you wouldn't qualify for the Adv1 tier until you had previously transacted $10K worth.  So to optimize your rates, you'd need to make a $1K order, a $9K order, then finally the remainder of your $30K, but this seems weird to me; it's been a while since I did big orders on CB.  In any case, this is all peanuts compared to the size of your order.

nb9maus,"If 1 BTC = $1,000,000 and you want to retire on it, selling outright is the obvious option, but then you‚Äôve got capital gains tax and you lose the exposure to BTC itself.  Another route is to borrow against your BTC. Basically, you lock up the coin as collateral with a lender (there are crypto platforms and even some traditional finance companies offering this). In return, you can take out a loan in stablecoins or fiat, usually up to 30‚Äì50% of the BTC‚Äôs value.  Pros:  You get liquidity without triggering a taxable event.  If BTC appreciates, your collateral is worth more.  You can structure the loan to provide regular income (withdraw some, invest in safe yield, etc.).   Cons:  Risk of liquidation: if BTC price drops too much, the lender can sell your BTC to cover the loan.  Interest rates vary a lot depending on platform and risk.  Custody risk: you don‚Äôt control the private keys once it‚Äôs locked with the lender.   Some people ladder it: keep a portion in cold storage, borrow a conservative % against the rest, then live off the loan proceeds or invest them in safer, income-generating assets.

Save your phrase, NEVER LOSE IT...if you plan to keep buying and storing, then repeat the part where you ""send"" your Bitcoin to your trezor.  If your goal is to sell, you can sell from CashApp, or send it to your coinbase Bitcoin address, and then sell it from coinbase.  Depending on how you feel about safety and security, you *can* keep your Bitcoin in CashApp or in coinbase..although not recommended if you plan to trust yourself.

Today price sits slightly below the resistance of the bull channel that dates back to Nov. If we reenter the channel, and find some resistance around 115-116, I could see a flag/pennant form that is loosely bound by channel support and 115-116 resistance. This would lead to compression in the price to around 115.2 at the time of the next Fed meeting before the next major move.

As we're constantly being told, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. One of the things you can do to manage your risk is to have a diversified portfolio with a range of coins with different purposes. 50% is a lot on a single coin and a lot to lose if things go wrong.  2. Use any advice you're given as a pointer to where to start your own research. I always ask negative questions like ""why has X got such bad press most of the time?"" If all is well you'll struggle to get much feedback. On the other hand if you ask something like ""What's the price of X at the end of the year going to be?"" I bet the 'articles' you find are really advertising copy. That's my experience anyway.  3. Trust your intuition. If your gut says ""NOOOOOO"" listen to it.

Any payment network that excludes the U.S. is hobbled from the get go.   As to RLUSD, stablecoins make much more sense than any crypto in highly liquid markets like USD/GBP or USD/CAD but XRP (or LINK possibly) still would be a cheaper transaction in high friction corridors (i.e. transaction between parties in two countries that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of trade between them like Eithiopia to Latvia or something like that).

But 75% of them are poison, another 20% taste like ass, another 4% are meh at best, and if you're lucky, 1% of the rest are tasty and at the very least not deadly.  Still want to dabble a little in everything?  If you're only spending a little money on crypto and you're just gambling so it's no big deal if you lose it all, then go for it.  The best decision I ever made was to learn the basics of tokenomics.  This means:  What's the total supply cap?  Never buy a coin without one.  What's the schedule for how the supply gets released?  Never buy a coin without one.  What's the method for how the supply gets distributed?  Avoid coins where insiders are given a ton of their own coin.  **Let's use Bitcoin as an example:**  Total Supply Cap: 21 million coins.  There will never be more than that.  Schedule for how the supply gets released:  50 coins are created and given away to whoever creates the next block on the blockchain, roughly once every ten minutes, starting in January 2009, with the amount being cut in half roughly every four years until a total of 21 million coins have been created.  Method for how the supply gets distributed: Whoever creates the next block on the blockchain wins the block reward.  Zero insider grifter B.S.  **Here's why this stuff matters:**  If you're holding coins with bad tokenomics, you're probably going to end up watching their value go down, down, down.  You might even get rugged.  And blips of hope along the way will fool you into thinking they're coming back, so you'll keep holding as they go further down.",CryptoMarkets,2025-08-28 00:49:43,18

I compared how I did vs how I'd have done if I'd just put the money in Bitcoin.  It was basically a draw, but only because I got lucky on Luna and got out before it collapsed, so I came out ahead.  The way I see it...  the more money you have, the easier it is to gamble since you've already got money.  If you've already got money and you blow a bunch of gambling alts, who cares?  I'm not rich, so I want to invest, not gamble.  > I'm not gonna die because I dropped some spare cash on a speculation  You're right.  And on the short term, it won't matter.  But after a few years, you may look back at all of that money, wasted on speculation, and wonder, ""What if I'd invested it in coins I actually believe in, instead?""

nap2h29,"tldr; Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) experienced $1.43 billion in outflows last week, ending a two-week inflow streak. The sell-off coincided with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping from $116,000 to $112,000 and Ether (ETH) falling below $4,100. Ether ETFs saw $430 million in outflows on Tuesday alone, marking the second-largest on record. Analysts attribute the losses to polarized investor sentiment over U.S. monetary policy. Bitcoin ETPs faced over $1 billion in outflows, while Ether saw $2.5 billion in inflows month-to-date. Altcoin flows were mixed, with XRP gaining $25 million and Solana $12 million.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

nafaylm,"I'll agree that a lot of people are stupid.  But, it takes a lot more than a lack of stupidity to understand the underlying value of something like BTC or ETH. Have you ever tried to explain a block chain to someone? *Can* you explain a blockchain?   What about the concept of trustless? Or, cryptographically secured? Or, decentralized? Or, a distributed ledger?   Can *you* explain why a money supply that doesn't require trust is *good* for society? Can you explain how quantitative easing works and its relationship to BTC? Can *you* explain how the current monetary policy requires trust and how that trust has been betrayed?  You see what I'm saying? These concepts are not easy to wrap you brain around. Shit, the *current* monetary system isn't easy to wrap your brain around. Most people have no idea what QE is, why it's bad, when it's been deployed, how it effects the M2 supply, inflation, and debt. The vast majority of people don't understand the current monetary system. So, trying to get them to understand a new one, like BTC, is even more difficult, because they fail to understand, or are even aware of, the problems with the current monetary system.   If you are speaking to someone who doesn't understand the money supply, M2, and quantitative easing, and how the 2008 financial crisis was 'solved', selling a new monetary policy to them is tricky. To them, BTC/ETH is simply a speculative asset, and nothing more.   Further, its important to remember that the *vast* majority of people you'll ever talk to about this have had the privilege of living in a society that uses the worlds reserve currency, the USD, and who have also had the privilege of being securely banked. So to them, the need to replace the dollar and monetary system isn't readily apparent.   Now, if we go to Argentina, for example, this is a much easier sell, as most people who are alive and working today have experienced a failed currency and hyper inflation. You say to someone in the US ""hey I've got some better money that will hold value in your bank account, want to try it?"" People think you are kind of crazy, especially considering the volatility in the markets. Now, say this to someone who has experienced hyperinflation, and they'll listen up. Its just a difference in perspective. In the US, the degradation of the dollar has been a slow burn, so many people, are numb to it, not stupid.   People aren't stupid, its just that they are living in a different paradigm. If you say to them you've got a replacement for their money, and then show them something that has proven to be extremely volatile, well, that is a tough sell.  And, its not really fair to call someone stupid for not accepting that.",ethtrader,2025-08-24 15:16:00,57

najzmt5,"OP: I'm playing devil's advocate here, because I know Ethereum is a solid project. But many people don't know that yet and Ethereum's marketing until recently was nonexistent. There's a reason why they were not jumping in at low prices.  Buying low only works if the asset has solid fundamentals, marketing, and adoption. People often assume there‚Äôs something wrong with an asset if its price crashes significantly, and conversely, they tend to think an asset is ‚Äúgood‚Äù when its price is high and rising over a long period.  Take IOTA as an example. Its price surged in late 2017 and early 2018, and many people - including myself - FOMO‚Äôd near the all-time highs. However, the price never recovered much after that. It saw a modest increase in 2021 but never reclaimed its previous peak. Does that mean people are foolish for hesitating to buy it now at much lower prices?

n97beme,That won‚Äôt solve the issue Bitcoin is facing. They will need to revise the issuance schedule to afford even the current amount of network security which is 1/10th of the economic security that ETH provides without a risk of a failing security budget . And yes 21million is 100% arbitrary and it‚Äôs not deflationary. It‚Äôs is inflationary until it allegedly reaches a hard cap in over 100 years from now,ethtrader,2025-08-17 16:46:42,2

n93khi3,"Amazon was priced appropriately in 2005. You can't ascribe it a valuation from years later and then say it was undervalued back then. It wasn't worth that much until they scaled further, gained more market share, improved margins, etc., and that took years. All that success was not guaranteed in 2005. You're using survivorship bias to go backwards, inflate past value based on future success (with 20/20 hindsight!), and then using all that to justify 25k for ETH today.

n9d0bs5,"99% of security is paid through inflation. Fees have not increased in a meaningful way other than very short non sustaining bursts. This has been true for essentially the entire life of the blockchain. During this time we have had many halving resulting in less issuance and yet the fees have not increased as a percentage of the block rewards meaning the bitcoin value of fees is going down substantially over time. While this is happening we also have diminishing returns in the ATH post having. Let‚Äôs just say that the current ATH of 124k (this is actually lower than what the diminishing returns trend projects that number is 128k-132k) is the top of this cycle, this means that if the trend continues the next halving will be the last to have an new ATH arround 200k then price will stagnate close to that price. If you do the math you will find that in 2 halvings the price of bitcoin NEEDS to be $1m just to sustain the network security we have today(which I will also say is 1/10th of the economic security provided by Ethereum under proof of stake). Now let‚Äôs say this plays out, Bitcoin stagnates at 200k (1/5th of the price we need to sustain today‚Äôs hashrate) the network will be highly vulnerable especially since there is a massive stockpile of asics that have been built up due to over subsidy of the network security. This can easily be repurposed to launch an unrecoverable attack on bitcoin.",ethtrader,2025-08-18 15:11:44,1

Burnt tokens by the dev, and the purchase of @StudsNFTs burn $Horsemeat supply. Why the limited supply? The creators goal is for 1 token (200lbsHorsemeat) to equal the price of 1 Bitcoin. Crazy idea right!? Well, what would it take for 200lbsHorsemeat to equal say $69k? A market cap of $535,153,650, crazy? A little. Impossible? No. The bull cycle is getting ready to start, many meme coins have reached and will reach incredible market caps in the next 14 months.  The community makes the project, the diamond hooved holders of $Horsemeat have held when the price of 200lbs > 1Sol, the dev held through that as well. Why? Conviction.

lq68jfg,Kendu is my horse for the bullrun. It is full of multi cycle veterans who understand how to run a coin up. They are familiar with and are comfortable in the crypto market and all of its associated volatility. I have never come across a coin with so little fud. Everyone knows that the retracements are a part of the game.  Speaking of retracements‚Ä¶ Kendu has been consolidating for months since Ath. Tokens have redistributed nicely. Someone ran a state a week or so ago that stated over 524B tokens have changed hands since May 29th. The token distribution is super healthy as a result. And diamond handed holders who believe in the long term vision are taking control of the supply.  But memecoins are all about community. And Kendu has formed a cult like following. Cults are going to be the meta this cycle. You need people who believe in a project and want to work for it. To build something long term instead of flipping for a quick gain. The recent 1B Kendu giveaway is a perfect example how how far people are willing to go for Kendu: [https://x.com/\_kevinfinnerty/status/1840794365314134414?s=46&t=v\_u-0xiVcMq4VE4yzPK9sw](https://x.com/_kevinfinnerty/status/1840794365314134414?s=46&t=v_u-0xiVcMq4VE4yzPK9sw)  Kendu is working on building an ecosystem. A global brand. We aim to be a household name by the end of 2025. And that‚Äôs just the beginning.  https://preview.redd.it/i5hi308zyksd1.jpeg?width=1241&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46b75b013499b5a2321840ee2bbbe7e2be3d885e,SatoshiStreetBets,2024-10-03 18:00:11,30

This is a ground-floor opportunity to get involved in something before it blows up! * On the other hand,¬†$KENDU¬†is already at an impressive¬†$55M market cap¬†and rising. With the upcoming ShibaCon, there‚Äôs speculation that¬†$KENDU¬†could easily push towards¬†$1B¬†as more eyes turn to the project. The timing couldn‚Äôt be better.  # Miazaki‚Äôs Big Reveal?  Miazaki is set to be a key part of ShibaCon‚Äîdoes that mean we can expect a surprise announcement that could positively affect both¬†$FREAK¬†and¬†$KENDU? With the two Devs on stage together, anything could happen, and we‚Äôre expecting big things that will ripple through both projects.

The regulatory environment is likely to change in a way that‚Äôs very positive for projects like¬†$FREAK¬†and¬†$KENDU. Under Trump‚Äôs leadership, crypto could take on a whole new level of importance, potentially opening up massive opportunities.  # Why Now Is the Time for $FREAK  The market cap of¬†$FREAK¬†is still super low compared to the potential it has, especially with its connection to¬†$KENDU¬†and all the exposure both coins are about to get.
