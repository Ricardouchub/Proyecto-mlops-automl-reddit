If you have any specific titles you care about I'd suggest checking ProtonDB and filter the reports to just Steam Deck ones to get a picture of how the game might run, and sometimes games are marked unsupported by Valve but does actually run with caveats like input quirks so you'd be able to play if you're fine with those quirks.",hardware,2026-02-06 09:49:24,3

Yes, you've made the same nominal profit of $150, but your margin % dropped from 50% to ~43% *and* this simple math example doesn't take into account that there is a cost involved with having to source the memory yourself (i.e pay staff to manage contracts, make and track orders, receive shipments, package the RAM, etc.)  That's why it's very difficult for on-package memory to gain traction in the Windows PC world: Most CPU makers don't want to take the margin hit, and most OEMs would prefer to just handle memory quantity and product tiering themselves.",hardware,2026-02-02 04:48:31,10

In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.

The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600.

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.

AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",hardware,2026-01-07 12:05:46,2

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

If you are looking for an easy solution without changing anything, you can always consider using frame generation.",pcmasterrace,2026-02-17 11:20:58,1

If work was your primary goal, then 9950X3D is simply the best for that. 32GBs of ram makes 0 sense as well for work load, You will regret not getting 64gbs very soon. I know that I have been regretting not getting 64gbs. You can most definitely afford it as you got 5090.   If gaming is your goal, then 9800X3D/9850X3D is the best and getting an overpriced ProArt MOBO for Intel's CPU (which sucks by the way) once again makes no sense. If aesthetic is your thing, then why get noctua fans? Why not go fully Noctua as well?  You also got a fishtank case, but your build is genuinely going to look mad wild, because you are going to mix several different aesthetics. I really want to see the end build.   I mean congrats, but I'm so confused, considering you got 5090, which cost overall more than everything else in your build.

It still looks better than playing at 1440p Quality/balance mode. Combine with using RIS2 and a slight overclock, the performance is not bad at all.  You could also just use fsr4 performance mode at 3200x1800, overall better experience than playing at native 1440p.  Path tracing even without any additional help from NRC, Ray regeneration and the help of the devs optimisation is still a viable option on the 9070xt.

When xess/fsr inputs are used then Ray reconstruction is disabled, therefore only the in-game denoiser is being used and everything is rendered properly.  Optiscaler doesn't make PT anymore stable or less stable.

Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",AMD,2026-01-01 22:29:53,2

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors.

I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears.

I use my laptop basically as a desktop so I only use the display of the Gigabyte monitor. The issue only happens when I connect my laptop with the Gigabyte M027Q28G, when I try to connect my laptop to other monitors the issue doesn't even appear and the refresh rate is stable throughout the entire usage of the monitor.  When my twin brother hooks up his laptop to the monitor he doesn't suffer from the refresh rate drop issue at all so the issue only appears when I hook up my laptop to our Gigabyte M027Q28G.  When I'm using the monitor I connect it with a HDMI cable to my laptop through the Baseus Joystar 7-in-1 USB-C Hub as my laptop has only USB-C ports so no HDMI port or a DisplayPort port at all.  I've tried the following things in order to try solve the mentioned issue:  * Reinstall the GPU drivers of my laptop. * Pull the HDMI cable out of the HDMI port on my USB-C hub and then plug it in again.  Regrettably these things I tried didn't solve the issue so now my question is how I can solve the refresh rate drop issue when my laptop is connected to the Gigabyte M027Q28G.

So I bought a 14900k and that wouldn't boot even with the latest bios. I had an Auros Z790 elite AX motherboard with 96gb Corsair vengeance 5200mhz DDR5 ram, and RTX 4090. So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now. When I press shut down, my screens turn off and it seems like it's off, but my fans and light and everything else are still running. So I have to hold the power button to shut it down.   I am suspicious of my PSU because I think it could cause some of these issues, but I've had this PSU only since 2023 and it's a Corsair HX1000i.   The only things I kept from my old build were the PSU, GPU, and ram. And considering both systems were having issues, it makes sense that maybe one of them is acting up. But I don't really know if that explains all the problems I've been having.   I've updated the Bios, I've reinstalled windows, I've tweaked power plans and bios settings, reseated hardware, and I feel like I'm just on a wild goose chase.

I recently swapped from a 7600x to a 9800x3d, playing on the 7600x felt great but I would get FPS drops and struggled to hold 240 let alone 360 FPS in games, so it looked a bit choppy sometimes. I decided it would be a no brainer upgrade to go to the 9800X3D, after installing it, my FPS was way better and the gameplay looked way smoother, however the input 'snappiness' and 'responsiveness' had completely taken a hit, my inputs felt sluggish and mushy, like I was playing through a filter, alot of inconsistencies, like mouse not feeling 1 to 1 accurate all the time and occasionally being slower than faster. My car on rocket league felt ""floaty"" and ""heavy"".

Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.

If this isn't your department, would it be possible for you to pass it on or redirect me to someone in that department?   I recently did a fresh Windows install, and during a Windows update, the AMD 32.0.21030.2001 driver was installed and worked incredibly well regarding audio and image quality (video & overall). Audio quality, specifically, is still the best I've heard from any AMD driver to date.  I thought maybe the fresh install itself might have been the reason for the better audio quality, so I installed an adrenaline driver that I'm very familiar with, and was disappointed because the audio was noticeably worse. I've now tried every driver besides 25.12.1 & 26.1.1, and the audio quality is substantially worse compared to 32.0.21030.2001.",AMD,2026-02-06 21:22:10,1

Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.

Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.

I have powered speakers connected via usb to a pcie USB card installed in the pc, and I have a separate DAC (for my headphone setup) connected via USB to the motherboard.   All of the differences I'm hearing are from subjective assessments while testing & using the drivers.  All of my listening has been and is with Windows audio set to 16/44.1 for each device. I don't use any of the AMD audio outputs that populate the audio control panel, so I disable them. I don't use any software players; Roon, Jriver, etc. I just listen to music with Qobuz (Wasapi 16/44.1) and Spotify. Additional listening is done with Youtube and Twitch via Firefox. Just everyday simple stuff.  I hear you, the reason I haven't tried running WU again to maybe get that specific driver again is mainly because I don't want to update my system to a build that could potentially cause performance degradation or instability.

Intel,o46e0sj,"First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to listen/read and look into this, I appreciate it greatly. I'm not sure why, but it seems your reply about the issue possibly being related to ISR isn't showing up on here for some reason. Could just be the site being dumb.  So, the audio differences I'm hearing aren't related to functionality, or the ability to playback audio without interrupts (dropouts, clicking, popping, choppiness). That has been flawless, for me, which is great. I'm referring to audio fidelity differences between drivers.  For instance, I uninstalled the driver I've recently been testing (25.12.1) via DDU and listened to some music with just the Microsoft display adapter being used as the driver. The audio sounded pretty normal again, and what I would consider correct/good. I then ran windows update, and it thankfully installed the 32.0.21030.2001 driver. Listened to some music, and as I heard before, it's still the best sounding driver I've used. The only other driver I've used that comes close is 25.1.1. That one has some slight issues with audio fidelity and image quality, but it was close enough to correct at the time.   The only thing I can think of that sounds similar and would describe what I'm hearing with these newer drivers is when you have a bit-depth and sampling rate mismatch between your music and output device. I have my audio devices set to 16/44.1 in windows, but with these newer drivers (25.9.1-25.12.1), the audio sounds as if the bit depth and sampling rate are set to higher values, even though they aren't. It's extremely strange, and sort of difficult to explain, but that's what I'm hearing.   The frustrating and unfortunate reality that might be coming into play here, is that differences could also vary between systems. So, a bad sounding driver on my system (25.9.1), might possibly sound fine or even good on a different system with different components.  It could also be caused by or related to interactions between code or the registry entries of different programs on the system interacting with drivers, but that's above my level of understanding. I'm just a dude who is noticing stuff (audio & video) and would like others who are smarter and more skilled to look into why there are differences in the first place and what could potentially be causing them.    By the way, you guys have been doing a great job with the video/image quality of these recent drivers. They are substantially better and closer to reference than everything previously released. 25.9.1 and 25.11.1 are the best drivers I've tested/used, in regards to video & image quality.",AMD,2026-02-08 01:11:28,1

Intel,o4hted2,"Ah gotcha. To be fair, I would say the differences between these more recent drivers are much smaller now compared to the drivers released in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Especially trying each driver from 25.9.1 to 25.12.1, specifically the audio, seems to get better with each release. It seems the team, or someone, also heard what I did with the 25.9.1 driver and tried to fix/improve it with each subsequent driver release.   I haven't tried 26.1.1 yet, but I will to test and compare. I'll also install LatencyMon to see if there is a correlation between good/bad audio and latency.  It really seems like the team that handles the display/video side of the drivers has mostly corrected the issues that were present with the old drivers (video output format/range, luminance levels, gamma curve, sharpness, white point, grayscale & color accuracy). There are still differences, but I wouldn't get too worried about it.  The oddball out of the bunch is 25.8.1. The audio is actually pretty good, but different. Sounds as if there is a surround sound effect turned on, or the audio output format is surround sound instead of stereo. It works really well for gaming, but music sounds a little strange. Due to the overall frequency response balance, it's honestly not bad. If it wasn't for the video/image quality side of things, I would probably use that driver.   On the video side, I think there is something wrong with the gamma curve and color. The gamma curve tracks higher (darker) in the lower luminance range. The white point and grayscale are more blue than neutral gray, and the overall color saturation is reduced, as if the color gamut clamp in the adrenaline software is being used. I checked to see if this was the case with my colorimeter, but the color gamut is normal for my monitor, so the actual color volume isn't being reduced.

For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch.

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",AMD,2025-11-14 05:48:36,2

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,22

(I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent.

If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",AMD,2024-10-30 20:22:39,1

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*.

Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I have been able to interact directly with the AMD support engineers they provide access to, and the support is severely lacking. These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?  Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

Anyway, these new chips certainly suck more power if they need it and are set to performance mode but that also comes with a lot more performance.   Performance mode does kick the fans up, which would help with dissipating heat. This mode seems to be around 40w max. The balanced mode is about a 30w max and the eco-silent looks to be sub 20w.

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.

Major props to everyone that contributed their time to those open source drivers!  ASUS was still releasing new models of Xonar hardware for more than a decade after the originals, even as they let the drivers stagnate. Something around 30 Xonar products they couldn't be bothered to driver support. Win 10 launched and it took nearly six more months before a beta driver belatedly showed up, then more than a year before a non-beta driver was released and that was the last update for my card. Even so there were some showstopper bugs in the only drivers ASUS released so those open unified drivers proved to be a lifesaver.  Given my other experiences with ASUS being reluctant to dedicate software support to its products I'd be far more inclined to suspect the fault is with ASUS on the delayed/lack of Z1 driver updates.

That number already reflects a period when they were prioritizing DC sales as much as they could at peak demand. And even under those conditions, they still needed to sell most dies to client where they got the 40% of their revenue from that wouldn't exist without gaming.  So DC is where margins are, with cyclical and highly unpredictable demand patterns, and usually limited volumes. Client is where the volumes of the products they make actually reliably sell. Most Zen and RDNA dies will end in consumer products simply because there isnt enough lasting demand from business to buy them at their higher margins.  Importantly, gaming makes them tens of billions of dollars a year, is a revenue stream and demand channel that's consistent and growing over decades.   We like to make ourselves feel so irrelevant, but there would be no AMD without client even WITH the unprecedented AI/DC boom we're witnessing.

I don't care if you don't actually overclock or upgrade the CPU. Intel non-OC chipsets are still more expensive than AMD OC chipsets and buyers clearly like having the option of OC/dropping in a new CPU even if they never actually do it.  This may change with Nova Lake/LGA 1951, since Zx70 boards are coming back and the socket will allegedly support four generations of CPUs.

AMD,o6o95rx,"Steve raises a good point, after building my own desktops for 23 years (and ironically all of those being on Intel platforms) I am having a super hard time envisioning Intel managing to stick to a single socket for just four years, certainly forgot about 6-8. Intel doesn't have the clout or the performance lead to get away with two year, even two generation sockets anymore. And I say that even despite Intel's new modular chip approach, which would allow Intel to maintain socket compatibility more easily than it could with monolithic chips. Intel has yet to commit to even a mid-length socket plan.   On the flipside, given the bulk of the volume of Intel's chips are sold through OEMs how much does the DIY segment ultimately matter? OEMs have to buy all the various parts anyway so what does it matter if the platform changes yearly. And it has even less bearing on servers. Seems like another decade of this could see Intel as the small player in the DIY space yet still remain the vast majority of OEM offerings.  My previous desktop was Haswell, the last DDR3 generation. Quite literally between the 4th gen and 9th gen there just wasn't a point to upgrade. I started getting antsy by 10th gen, but the 11th gen disaster that was Rocket Lake nixed buying into another dead socket platform. So after seeing how stable and long-term AM4 support had been, combined with the incredible 5800X3D capstone for the socket I was sold on investing into AM5. Sure DDR5 was pricey at launch but I'd already skipped the DDR4 generation entirely. And since X3D chips mitigate the effects of slower memory one can continue to use the same memory across the life of the system without having to replace it which more than makes up for the early upfront cost. Picking up a drop-in CPU upgrade in 4-6 years meant that for the early adopters one AM5 system can effectively last a full decade without compromise, for only the cost of a second CPU.  The third angle is that all the AM5 early adopters are now sitting in the catbird seat, even in spite of the AI shitfest dragging everything down into a cesspool of misery they can pick up a Zen 6 X3D chip for a drop in upgrade and remain entirely unaffected. Clearly the expectation we've all held about how things will remain normal and that hardware will always be getting cheaper (sans GPUs) probably needs to be reassessed. Sure prices will probably return to normal (or even crash given all the fab capacity being built today that will be online by 2030), but by building a system you won't have to replace means builders won't be exposed to begin with when the next crazy thing comes along. We've already had two crypto bubbles, covid supply disruptions, two separate trade tariff wars, and now we have AI induced mass inflation. All in the span of **one** decade. I think way more people are going to eventually recognize just how good having platform longevity is, particularly when it comes without compromises.",hardware,2026-02-21 22:06:41,38
AMD,o6rgyxw,"Great video, these revisions/retrospectives are some of my favourite HUB content. In spite of being very relevant, so few outlets do them - and nobody seems to do them as well.  AMD made huge gains within AM4 for sure, with the fantastic X3D CPUs to finish with a dominant gaming platform. What this video doesn't even highlight, is that when I bought a brand new system in mid 2021 (before the release of Alder Lake), AM4 was still straight up the best value for an all new gaming platform, and I bought it without any reasonable expectation of upgrading.  I feel Steve kind of glosses over AM5's expected upgrade path towards the end, where he does rightfully mentions that an in platform upgrade path mostly makes sense if you start on the lower end. Even now (or at least before RAM prices blew up) getting a 7500/7600X the upgrade path was a huge consideration as the 11800X3D (or whatever the name will be) should be a huge in platform gain (though nothing like a 1700X to 5800X3D). If you get in on AM5 now with a 9800X3D, I don't think the remaining platform longevity will ever provide a significant in socket upgrade.  Lastly, Steve mentions his surprise at the high end 7800X3D and 9800X3D being 2 of the top 3 best selling CPUs on amazon. While I do think the hype and FOMO are a part of it, with the increasingly high GPU prices we've gotten used to, and especially alongside obscene RAM and NVME prices we've had as of late, the added cost to the total system for going to an X3D CPU just isn't that big a part of overall system cost anymore. If you spend $800 on a GPU and $350 on 32GB of RAM and $250 for 2 tb of storage, how much is that $200 extra for the best gaming CPU money can buy? Purely speculative, but that's my take.  Either way I'm looking forward to what zen 6 will bring. The rumoured new IO die should be at least interesting to see if they can squeeze more performance out of this socket, though still not expecting anywhere near the gen-on-gen improvements they managed to make on AM4.",hardware,2026-02-22 12:42:59,17

AMD,o6om4g2,"Even for DIY builders I would argue that it is a clear minority that upgrade their CPU's more regularily than every 4-6 years. I of course don't have any data to back that up, but anecdotal evidence plus the fact that CPU bottlenecks take longer that a generational gap to truly become relevant I think kind of backs that up.  Assuming you upgrade every 5 years, is swapping out a motherboard really that big of a deal, both in terms of cost and time spent? I honestly don't see a world in which it is.  Taking price into consideration, the logic kind of undercuts itself. If you’re upgrading every 1-2 years, you’re likely not that budget-constrained to begin with, but an upgradable platform indeed makes sense in that case. If you are budget-conscious, the rational move is to hold onto your as-is system for longer, and at that point, a full platform upgrade often makes sense anyway because you’re getting meaningful improvements beyond just the CPU.  So platform upgradability sounds great on paper, but in practice it only meaningfully benefits a narrow group of mid-cycle upgraders. For most buyers, total platform cost over time isn’t materially different, and the flexibility advantage is smaller than it’s often made out to be.",hardware,2026-02-21 23:20:31,9

But I remember how Amd screwed over many am4 owners that had to upgrade to newest am4 board just to use zen3 cpus before AMD change its mind when am4 was eol. And remember when zen/+ was still a thing many techtuber recommended very expensive ram at the time, b-die.   Then when intel launched its skylake 8/9/10 the ram question was not as important anymore for the techtubers and yet fast ram was and still to this day is important for intel.

AMD,o6sruwb,"They're making the same mistakes over and over again.    There is no real doubt that the upgrade itself is cheaper, but there are a couple of problems in their takes:  1. They conveniently chose their upgrade times to fit their narrative. An upgrade at a different time would not have been as good of a deal.   2. The difference between the 1700X and 7700k was bigger than between the 14600k and 5800X3D according to their own testing? Why not use the part that was closer in performance?  3. If you bought Zen 1, you bought a 300 series motherboard and slower RAM with it. An AM4 upgrade would also have required a RAM upgrade, negating a lot of what you save.  4. Early 300 series boards, especially B350 had a lot of trouble with RAM and there are a lot of tests that show that modern AM4 CPUs don't run at their full potential and can't use memory that is as good.    You lose out on PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 too and are stuck with horrendously outdated I/O.    Why didn't they test the 5800X3D or 5700X on an actual B350 board?    They're whole argument is based on running a Zen 3 CPU with faster RAM on a different mainboard.   And that's just on their methodology.   The more general ""problems"" with platform longevity:  \- Using AM4 as an example is bad, because it only looks so good because Zen 1 sucked. It was overhyped, buying in on the ""the future will be multithreaded"" narrative and that's it. In gaming, Zen 1 was closer to Ivy Bridge or Haswell than Skylake.   \- They never asnwer the question on how much to factor it in in buying decision  \- They completely ignore that chipsets matter too, AMD only allowed Zen 3 much later on early AM4 boards (most oof which had some performance regression)  \- There is no guarantee in longevity. AMD always phrases it in a way that they're not liable for anything. They made the same promises about Threadripper and broke them thrice. After the first broken promise their new promises were even stronger. Why buy into a promise that the vendor will happily break if it benefits them?  \- There is no guarantee about performance. What if all new CPUs are a Zen 5% scenario all over again? You don't know before.   \- You still pay for it. In theory, a longer platform support is good but do they really think ""intel"" does it because they're greedy and AMD doesn't because they're friend?    In reality, neither AMD nor intel are really affected by that directly, motherboard vendors are. Do people really think that motherboard vendors are happy with having to support a product much longer and provide updates (which costs money) while lowering their own revenue due to that?    No, of course not. And that's why motherboard manufactures cheap out so much, especially on AM5 boards.    For the same price, motherboards are typically much worse on AM5, both in I/O and quality and that's likely also the reason why there are a lot more issues on AMD boards.    And the last point is important. Besides that, it seems to be simply a good thing to have longer socket support, but unfortunately that's not how it works.    If Asrock, Asus, MSI etc etc. sell you a motherboard that they'll have to support for ten years, they have to make the same profit with it as they would if you bought two boards fives years apart, otherwise they would hurt their business.",hardware,2026-02-22 16:50:25,-3

You're under the assumption that Ryzen users upgrade their CPU on every release?  >If you bought a 8700k then a 12900k, you got the same generational span a ryzen user got, with two mobos instead of one.  It's not that significant.   And if you bought a 1700x then a 5800X3D, you got a platform with more performance and didn't have to spend an extra $200+ on a new motherboard, that's the point.  Also, from the video's performance chart: https://i.ibb.co/R46KDTFr/image.png  The 12900k was slower and that's with DDR5 7200 memory. So an extra ~$150+ if you bought it back in 2021.",hardware,2026-02-21 21:04:05,18
AMD,o6qxjv2,"Zen 6 is expected to have a new I/O design to replace Infinity Fabric with a fan-out layout (already used by Strix Halo): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maH6KZ0YkXU  The expected improvements are lower power usage by the I/O, including at idle, and much larger bandwidth to remove the bottleneck between the CPU and fast DDR5 memory.",hardware,2026-02-22 09:47:57,10
AMD,o6tnqon,I'm specifically talking about NOT doing piecemeal upgrades. Which necessarily means not caring about what motherboard you buy along with the CPU when upgrading.   In isolation AM4 upgrades look impressive but it is rather due to the base effect of early Zen being pretty crap in gaming.  It is reflected in the graphs too.  8700K -> 10900K gave you the same uplift through one upgrade that you would have to do three upgrades on AM4 (1800X ->5800X).  And to say nothing of the fact that all this is based on hindsight. Any number of things could have turned out differently to cause AM4 upgrade prospects to be different from what they turned out to be.,hardware,2026-02-22 19:17:41,1
AMD,o6wv0hw,You need to put an asterisk next to the 5800X3D as the extra cache does not benefit all programs nor all games equally. Some will barely see any increase while others may see a performance decrease from the reduced clock speed.,hardware,2026-02-23 06:49:54,1
AMD,o6nklhv,"The title was a response to a lot of people making the argument that platform longevity ""doesn't matter"".   The video basically goes over the fact that in the span of the lifetime of a 1700x owner being able to upgrade directly to a 5800X3D and match AND eventually beat the equivalent Intel CPU - the 12900k, Intel went through 4 socket changes.",hardware,2026-02-21 19:56:30,10

AMD,o6qvfbd,But also if you bought a 1700x it was on a significantly worse platform and underperformed at anything that wanted ST performance.  For the 5800x3d it released quite late into it's generation so the more direct comparisons can't be made for upgrading/not upgrading at launch as the people buying 12th gen or 5000 series at release wouldn't know anything about it,hardware,2026-02-22 09:27:19,-3
AMD,o6tpext,But the whole point of the video is showing you that you didn't NEED to buy a new motherboard if you had AM4. Not to mention the fact the numbers are a big skewed in later generations (he used DDR5 7200 for 12900k and upwards).   So if you were an early adopter of lets say a 12900k:  $670 MSRP for the CPU   ~$200 for the DDR5 kit (it was very expensive even for lower end kits in the early days)   $300+ for even an entry level Z690 Prime motherboard  All of that extra money JUST to overtake the existing 5800x by 25%. Then 5 months later along came the 5800X3D which was just a drop-in upgrade to your existing hardware and beat the 12900k.,hardware,2026-02-22 19:25:47,-1

What I mean is, AMD's strategy with RT was meant to be cheap because it's the way Sony and MS got to have the tech while also not having spiraling hardware costs. Rdna2 is basically the tech those consoles got scaled up and rDNA 3 was rdna 2+.   Rdna4 was basically a rehash of what Sony paid for the ps5 pro. And rdna5 is likely going to be a beef up version of whatever the console manufacturers pay for the 2027 season.    AMD doesn't have anywhere near the r&d money nvidia has and it doesn't have the deep pockets Intel has to throw money to a hard problem until they crack it.   I'm going to be the first to complain about their lack of software strategy, but their hardware strategy makes sense when you consider they get a tenth of the market share nvidia gets and for the longest time had revenue much smaller than Intel's and Nvidia's.

AMD,o437sd5,"Native is not a magic resolution where everything is correct. This is a statement people keep making that sounds correct if you don't think about it, but it's just flatly wrong.      Tons of geometry and textures have detail that can be smaller than a pixel in games today. The vast majority of effects and basically all the lighting (whether ray traced or not) is initially rendered at lower than native resolution.  TAA is already used in basically every game because of how common deferred rendering is. If TAA weren't used, the flickering and aliasing would be so intense it would make games unplayably bad.    Even if none of that were true, the idea of native being ""correct"" makes no sense. We would have had no need then for antialiasing techniques like SSAA or MSAA.    DLSS and all upscaling techniques today are a form of super sampling. It's just that they trade off spatial resolution and do the super sampling temporally. Using data from past frames is obviously worse than just rendering at a higher resolution in a vacuum. But you need cheap anti aliasing that covers everything anyway. And basically every game needs temporal accumulation (to run effects at sub-native resolution) in order to run fast enough with good enough visual quality anyway. And if you really can create an algorithm that effectively reuses data from past frames, then it can both look better and run faster than native.    Now could there be edge cases where something looks worse? Sure. All you need to do is look at FSR2/3 to see how worse algorithms make a ton more tradeoffs. But with good techniques, there will also be many situations where it can look better.    And if you truly care about quality above all else, then you can turn up graphical settings when introducing some upscaling. You'd have to compare something like ""Native"" with Low settings to DLSS with Medium or High settings (turning up the most impactful graphical settings until the framerate was the same).    Personally, at 4K output,  DLSS is always worth turning on.

Not sure anymore, but after a public outcry and support from LTT, GN, and other outlets, Nvidia reversed their course.  Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Only around the Radeon RX 9000 series release did HU balance their coverage. I believe this was because both companies, AMD and Nvidia, had done so much anti-consumer shit by that point, that the public hated them (almost) equally.  Before this launch, the Reddit majority opinion was ""AMD has shittier drivers, but GPUs are much better value, and we can handle worse FSR for the price difference, also they are much better for Linux and fuck Nvidia for many valid reasons"". After the launch, Nvidia invested into Linux drivers (but had Windows driver issues of their own), AMD did the same shit with pricing, and DLSS pulled away far enough from FSR that the difference became too difficult to ignore.

After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  I mean that's a fair attitude no? People might disagree with it, but that's not evidence of bias, it's just an opinion on the value of RT. RT has only really come into fruition in the last few years, before then it was a reflective puddle that halved the frame rate or something. Not focussing lots of benchmarking RT for the perhaps 5 games where it is worth it does make sense.  >Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Since DLSS 2 (1 was awful), they've always said DLSS was better than FSR. At times FSR wasn't that far behind DLSS, and when AMD cards were a fair bit cheaper it might be been worth it for some.

They've only had two eras in which their desktop chips were on top:  * ""Athlon"" / ""Athlon 64"" vs Intel's ""Netburst"" (2000-2006)  * ""Zen 3"" and later vs Intel's ""Lakes"" (i.e. Rocket / Alder / Raptor / Arrow; 2021 to present).  Setting aside AMD's humble beginnings as a ""second source"" manufacturer of Intel's designs in the 1980s and their eternal game of catch-up in the 1990s after Intel discontinued second sourcing of their designs starting with the 486, they were completely noncompetitive between late 2006 and the advent of Zen 1 in 2017 due to their ""Phenom"" and ""Bulldozer"" architectures lagging far behind Intel's ""Core"" CPUs.    Note that even when Ryzen launched it still took three generations just to reach technological parity in 2019-20 versus Intel's then-current offerings (i.e. Ryzen 3000-series / ""Zen 2"" vs Core 10000-series / ""Comet Lake"") as well, so honestly it's *only* been 5+ years of AMD being in the lead so far this time around.",hardware,2026-02-07 14:42:07,18

But CO -30 All Cores was max I could set before IMC aka Memory Controller was crashing even I could set -125 All Cores so to hit more then CO -30 stable you need Hyper Duper Platinum binned silicone! And if you are stable at CO -30 then you won silicone lottery and you should be easy to set FCLK at 2200mhz which is biggest gains for system responsiveness you can set quite easy!

You click and app is open and ready to go + feeling of mouse how smooth suddenly become! Even likes of Steam opening visible quicker!    But having 9800x3D gives you uplift because of extra 64mb cache and this cache too exchanging data with memory so when your extra cache can exchange data faster you get more performance all for free!!

(Honestly, this has merit, as RT/PT on-device is taxing, so very complex calculations could be offloaded in future, but on-device hardware should not have been neglected either)  I think Sony and Microsoft pressed them to improve hardware RT and dense geometry performance for next-gen consoles, which were in conceptual development 4-5 years ago, and becoming more finalized (regarding hardware requirements) within the last couple of years. High performing matrix cores were probably a requirement for a high quality temporal upscaler and RT denoiser as well.

So, intead of trees with leaves and branches, you got this clumpy malformation of trees with a bunch of green colors that were supposed to be leaves that looked like something from 10 years prior. The upscaler also wasn't great as Nvidia was trying to make the tensor cores do too many things at once.  DLSS2 was where Nvidia turned the corner. That actually started with shader-based DLSS 1.9 that debuted in Control. This moved to a generalized training algorithm based on temporal multi-frame accumulation (TAA-based). Image softness and ghosting were still issues though, so AMD's contrast adaptive sharpening often provided better results when combined with a basic upscaler.  DLSS3/4/4.5 continued improving upscaler algorithms and models to where we are today. It took years to get to this point because missing pixel information was an issue when upscaling images.

To be fair to Nvidia, the segmentation wasn't necessarily ""needless"" once you know the history and origin of G-Sync.  Basically, G-Sync was born out of a side-effect of using the PSR feature of the eDP protocol as well as the Variable VBLANK flag.  Neither of these features existed in mainline DisplayPort at the time VESA had no intention of doing so.  It took nearly **2 years** after G-Sync was announced for VESA to announce their implementation into the DP1.2a spec and still more time after that because the LFC logic had to be built into the GPU (1st Gen G-Sync actually had LFC built-in to the custom ARM SBC they were using as the Display Controller+TCON).

There were **tons** of displays releasing even many years after G-Sync hit the market (with a pretty damn solid initial implementation) that were almost unusable in actual VRR scenarios due to a complete lack of adaptive overdrive.  > Making new tech and new standards is fine. Pushing for adaptation is fine. Making needless proprietary variants and creating needless segmentation is not.  Obviously, all else being equal, an open standard is preferable.  But all else isn't equal. As I said in my previous post, I'm under no illusion that any of these companies do anything for any reason other than to make money. And a company can justify investing a lot more into research, development, and - yes - a marketing push when they think they can subsequently benefit from a proprietary ecosystem.

I'm very excited for raising the baseline for cores in the CCX, but I'm not sure most people care except for enthusiasts. We've seen a real stagnation for how many cores are needed, both for games and for regular usage. If you asked me during the Zen3 generation (2020-2021) my guess would have been 8c would be a bottleneck in a very short time. Yet it isn't, even 6c performs quite well with just a tiny penalty in a minority of games.

The other reasons not to? Cost, and lack of upgradability. SOCAMM2 modules might be a solution (though will be initially a premium and unavailable), but typically there just isn't the performance reliability with socketed RAM vs soldered. AMD tried with Strix Halo, but concluded they could only offer a solution that involved soldered RAM, like Apple.

The first release of Nehalem (Bloomfield) was triple-channel with plenty of PCIe lanes, fully in line with how the PC was evolving up to that point.    Then they released a crippled toy version (Lynnfield) which had only two channels and a pathetic number of PCIe lanes, retroactively creating the HEDT market segment.  That HEDT segment became progressively more and more expensive, reaching a point where with one platform, your PCIe lanes were crippled unless you spent $1000 on the CPU.  AMD, in the Bulldozer era, still had a respectable number of PCIe lanes, though still two memory channels.  When they made AM4, they adopted the toy computer model with too few PCIe lanes, and still just two memory channels.  Threadripper was then created as a proper PC, in line with how things were going before Nehalem.  More memory channels, more PCIe lanes.  It wasn't priced too badly, either.  But after Intel stopped being able to compete in HEDT, AMD raised the floor of entry way too high.  I see no sign of a proper consumer PC platform being released any time soon.  The E-core spam strategy that Intel is following also suggests they have no intention of competing in HEDT again, either.

So if you would have 4 channels instead of 2, you would basically increase the cost on CPUs and Motherboards by a substantial amount, an most people would probably dont even use all those 4 channels, especially at the current prices of RAM.

Most problems that can be solved with throwing more sticks of RAM at something can be solved the same or better by throwing more RAM attached to another CPU and you get clustering benefits. And for when it does make sense, you can orchestrate RAM channels per CPU but then use the CPU to CPU channels like on Xeons to sync memory and tasks. For example look at the old HP DL980s (I think) that had 4 Xeons in them with 160ish cores. Then each had a literal bucket of RAM.

AMD,o6l9kdi,i've been down this rabbit hole before. the short answer is cost and market segmentation - quad-channel adds pins and motherboard complexity that most consumers won't pay for. what helped me was looking at the [Corsair Dominator Titanium DDR5](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Corsair+Dominator+Titanium+DDR5&language=en_US&tag=bestdeals202f-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl) or [G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=G.Skill+Trident+Z5+RGB&language=en_US&tag=bestdeals202f-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl) which hit really high speeds on dual-channel. those kits can push 8000MHz+ which helps with bandwidth. also Intel's non-K chips lock memory overclocking which forces people to buy their higher-end stuff. AMD's been more flexible with memory on their AM5 platform. for serious bandwidth needs Threadripper exists but that's a whole different budget tier.,hardware,2026-02-21 12:22:24,1
AMD,o6nelos,"A lot of incorrect and incomplete answers.   The correct answer is we do. DDR5 has two channels per DIMM, one stick of DDR5 has the same bandwidth as two sticks of DDR4 (unless you have an 8gb stick, which only has one channel and is basically high latency DDR4). It's why memory controllers struggle with four sticks of DDR5, it's the same bandwidth as 8 sticks of DDR4. The architecture sacrificed some latency for double the bandwidth. It goes great with the high number of threads modern CPUs have.   It's why latency is also the big bottleneck now.",hardware,2026-02-21 19:25:28,1
AMD,o6rf8hy,Memory bandwidth isn't really a issue for most people. For home uses memory latency is important but its still pretty much fine ddr4 and ddr5 both have good enough latency that most people dont notice. For example their is a basically ps4 pc kit that uses the apu and memory with parts of it disabled that people could buy and while it works it kind of sucks for home applications even though it has about 450 GB/s bandwidth while ddr5 is normally at about 50 GB/s the much worse latency just ruins it for many applications. So most home uses dont really need more than 2 channels of memory and memory channels are really really expensive to build into the chip so its jot reallt worth it for quad or octa channel memory controllers for a chip that 99% of the time is gonna be paired with at most 2 sticks of ram but ia often just using 1. Like if we could only put 4GB of ram on a stick then maybe we would need the ability to put 8 sticks in for consumers.,hardware,2026-02-22 12:29:32,1
AMD,o75ejdd,"I agree. Smartphones, handheld consoles, handheld PCs and standalone VR headsets are in desperate need of higher memory bandwidths. It would greatly help to have at least 280 GB/s for the whole SoC. Unfortunately, 75-110 GB/s for the whole SoC is definitely not enough. This is why Xbox One sucked so much, with its budget DDR3 memory (+very low number of TMUs and ROPs). It was awesome how much faster was the One X! I wish the OG One was already like One X in 2013!  RTX 5090 has really wide memory bandwidth and a substantial amount of memory, but it is very very costly unfortunately.  But also, memory bottleneck quite often really means too high memory latency, instead of too narrow bandwidth. Putting memory closer to the CPU/GPU/NPU definitely helps with latency.      Something is beginning to move in the right direction, because of AMD's Strix Halo, but that was 1 year ago. I've hoped for more devices using it. Intel's Panther Lake is having higher memory bandwidth than ever.",hardware,2026-02-24 15:24:13,1
AMD,o6kfk54,"how many consumer tasks scale with memory bandwidth so hard?  the general question is: do we have enough bandwidth to feet the max core chips on consumer platforms well enough?  and thus far that seems to still be true.  there is ONE task, that is EXTREMELY memory bandwidth limited though, which is apus on desktops.  so if amd would want to sell decent performing apus in a socketed desktop platform in the future, then 2 channels would be very limiting.  more likely however amd won't care about that and enjoy just selling higher performance apus with garbage soldered on and also non ecc memory instead.  and for all the rest we will see another bandwidth doubling with ddr6 coming with... am6 in many years though.  which should be good enough to feed things mostly, which would be 32 core at least zen8 chips.  32 core zen7 on am5 will be interesting however if there would be some bandwidth limitations in tasks happening then with just ddr5 and 2 channels.  \_\_\_  also the chipset doesn't matter. the chipset isn't part of the conversation literally. the cpu communicates directly with the memory. the chipset has no say in it. IN FACT you sell amd cpus without chipsets, as the i/o from the cpu is enough.  the thing, that they'd need to change is the io-die and the motherboards.  and io-dies are a lot cheaper to change than core chiplets, because they are on older nodes generally.  but yeah the one bandwidth issue, that exists is apus and they probably will just show us the middle finger anyways in that regard.",hardware,2026-02-21 07:35:17,1

Cheaper to up the specs and use binned chips than to keep things exactly the same.  If there was an iPhone sold with 128GB storage, people would buy it.

Intel has done hpc without bifurcation but it cost much more money for the same performance and needed almost 2x the power.

Even there some integrated gpu are able to run realytime raytraced games like cyberpunk, granted with a tonne of compromises and at like 30fps but as a proof of concept thats crazy.   For the average gamer using like 3060 levels of graphics I don't think most people would care if that came in the form of an integrated chip. Hardware heads, like myself, will likely always have their eye on higher specs but most people would be fine with games running through aggressive upscaling as long as framerates are relatively consistent.

There is just too much to gain from unifying everything. All the memory bandwidth you can cram in can benefit both the CPU and the GPU (and anything else that's in there). Maybe we'll get another round or two of viable traditional PC architecture but I think it's possible even for the next iteration of strix halo (medusa halo) to render all but top end gaming obsolete.  Even a 5090 which is difficult to even find a way to closely fully utilize from most gaming software in existence (due to being optimized for more modest hardware) is a baby next to the training and inference optimized nvidia hardware now... I look forward to good healthy competition between intel/nvidia APUs and AMD APUs. Surely some design will be forthcoming that can give good PCIe bandwidth to connect a top end discrete GPU and it will be a nice compact workstation powerhouse platform.

AMD,o5ciqsq,"They’re not a saint, but neither is AMD/Nvidia currently.  Let me put it this way, people have been stating that the price increases for these “budget” GPU’s has been an issue.  For example, a 9060XT is ~£400 and a 5060Ti is ~£450 whereas a budget card a decade ago with the RX580 was ~£300.   Yet content creators still push the 9060XT and the 5060Ti as “budget” cards.   They should change their definition of “budget” to be done by actual price. Because if they’re complaining that “budget” cards by AMD/Nvidia are increasing in price, Intel still sells a real budget card for £270-300.  “Budget” is an objective measure based on price to performance. Yet content creators still push cards that are objectively worse for those figures.   HW Unboxed made a video a month back comparing the 9060XT and the B580 as “budget” cards. The B580 is £120 cheaper than the 9060XT, how is that even a comparison?",hardware,2026-02-14 14:55:26,-5
AMD,o5ckxxo,"People have been complaining about the “inflation” with the different tiers of cards produced.   For example, a 9060XT is more expensive as a “budget” card than the RX 480 from a decade ago which was also a budget card.   Yet YouTubers like HW Unboxed frequently still call the 9060XT a “budget” card, despite that. In fact [he compares it to the B580 as a budget card](https://youtu.be/xlbNsP5ySmA) despite the B580 being £120 cheaper than a 9060XT. Of course people are going to look at those graphs and decide not to buy a B580 as a real budget option.   People can’t complain about the inflation of “budget” cards if they are basing the “budget” aspect on the naming scheme of the cards.   A B580 can be bought for £270, around the same price as a RX 480 a decade ago. Thats a budget card. The 9060XT and the 5060Ti aren’t “budget” cards yet YouTubers keep saying they are because of the model numbers.   “Budget” should be objectively based on the price of the cards, not the naming scheme assigned to them.

But for Blender Nvidia has a 68.7-117% more value than AMD. It will really come down to how much you value blender performance over gaming performance. I don't really know how you would judge the value of rendering time over gaming performance. It is very subjective.  But what resolution would you game at? Because if both the 5060ti and the 9060ti meet your performance standards in gaming, then you could consider the additional $180AUD spent on an Nvidia GPU to be an 'investment' in improved Blender performance and the question would be, is that $180AUD worth 117% more blender performance? But if neither the 9060xt or 5060ti really meet your performance standards in gaming, then it is more of a dilemma of gaming vs blender.",buildapc,2026-02-24 15:38:26,1

As long as everything is lined up, you will be fine. On the other hand, when you put the CPU in the socket, dont push it at all. Just set it on the socket and let it fall into place, otherwise you might bend some pins.

The difference between a 50 and 100 megapixel camera is only beneficial to applications that can take advantage of it.  Just like a computer with 24 cores on the processor are mostly useless until you run an application that can take advantage of all 24 cores at the same time.  >\- wondering, does a descrete graphics make such a huge impact in a pc perfomance?  Similar answer as above as you need an application like a game to truly see the impact.  Otherwise merely browsing the web, checking email, and watching Youtube ain't gonna make a difference even if it's a discrete vs integrated GPU.  There are many reasons why your newer system could have felt slower than your older system, but have you ever compared the time it takes to convert between the two systems on the same OS?  For all you know the conversion time on the newer system might be faster than the old but you have to run them both on the same OS and do your time comparisons.  It could be the way the software is configured on the old system that allows it to take advantage of hardware acceleration while the new system isn't set up properly.  Also your old system got to use those drives while they were young and fresh while the new system has to use the same drives while they're being grandpas.  You are trying to compare a server processor to a desktop processor and servers do excel at multiple I/Os.  That said the technology gap should've rendered this argument moot.",pcmasterrace,2026-02-25 15:30:14,2

AMD,o7c9cxj,"Use Task Manager to drop the priority of the processes doing the conversion.  Media encoding is a very intensive multi-threaded multi-core operation. When you moved to the new PC, you probably updated your software too, which would have brought more highly efficient video codecs like AV1 or HEVC, which you wouldn't have been using before.  If you have a profile to use the GPU's video encoder, VCN2.2, use that. This is likely what you were doing on the GTX 1050.

I'm pretty sure it makes sense to still make consumer GPUs if only because there's so much cutting edge node supply you can get. Plus they already did chiplet sharing in Epyc + Consumer that worked out well for us (when CPUs occupied the datacenter position that GPUs do now), so is there any reason to think that their upcoming MCM solutions and UDNA won't still give us options?  Idk, taking into account GPU chiplets or differentiated nodes where we don't get shared chiplets, I'm pretty sure it's totally possible to maintain consumer GPU supply if they want to.  The bigger concern IMO is memory chips. VRAM has been a huge limiter on consumer GPU development (which came to a head with \~2022-2024 8GB woes), but I'm pretty sure datacenter demand for memory will drive memory manufacturers to get more efficient and higher volume, which could have economies of scale benefits for us towards \~2029-2032?",pcmasterrace,2026-02-24 20:01:20,5

I did get the impression that graphics cards were going to become scarce.  I was kind of worried that if my graphics card broke I would not be able to get a new one.  So I pulled the trigger and purchased the POWER COLOR REAPER 9070XT and it works perfectly fine.  No issues at all just works no issues at all even with me running it at 4K.

On the other hand, what if as part of the revolution we're currently in the middle of, they find out that decimal calculations aren't the most important thing to optimise for? While power consumption will always be a decent indicator of a chips output, the type of operation could drastically change.

AMD,o79rnwv,"When you fill up your car, do you specifically enter the number of liters or gallons of gas that you want? No you just know that you have a 30 gallon tank and that you want to fill it up, or that you have $50 to spare so you punch that in. The number of liters of gas you buy entirely depends on how much more your car's fuel tank can accommodate, or what the gas budget was.  Same thing with datacenters. A company the size of Facebook isn't going to order individual GPUs piece by piece, or maybe even individual racks like AMD Helios or Nvidia NVL.   They just know how much capacity their latest datacenter has and go to a company like HPE (or direct to AMD/Nvidia) and ask for a quote for like 10MW worth of rack scale systems. Money would have been the other constraint, but apparently there is infinite money available for AI so these deals are being specified in watts rather than saying Meta is buying $100M of Helios racks.",pcmasterrace,2026-02-25 04:29:34,1

It has x16 lane so it won't be gimped by PCIE 3.0 and 4.0, it has slightly better performance than the 5060, a bit cheaper too. Only thing making me hesitant to buy it is the driver issues.   Before buying the 3060Ti that I have now, I was using a RX 470, and it was just nonstop problems on windows 10, driver timeouts, Adrenaline software deleting itself when i wake my pc up from sleep. Dogshit windows 10 updating the drivers automatically, causing crashes and imcompatibility issues. It was a nightmare to deal with. Looking up solutions online gives you dozens of solutions with none of them fully fixing it.  I don't wanna relive that experience.   My experience with 3060Ti was smooth sailing in comparison. I do think it's mostly a Windows problem, since I had little to no problems with AMD drivers back when I was still using Windows 7.

Most devs can port games there but they are compromised.  Also, it doesn’t really change anything is even if they release the PS6 it will likely be much more expensive, especially if they have to release it in the current economy.   The target will likely keep being the PS5 and for the low end the switch 2. That’s not going to change even if they’ve released the PS5 because people won’t have the money to buy a new $800+ console.

The Ryzen 8000 iGPUs (all iGPUs, really) are heavily bandwidth-limited by the RAM and if you can increase your memory frequency by 30% you might see a near-30% performance increase in some tests.  The Ryzen 8000 memory controller is also fabricated on much better silicon than the 7000/9000 IOD, so you can hit much higher frequencies much more easily. 10GT/s should be achievable on good sticks. I'm always irritated when I see 8700Gs benchmarked on DDR5-4800 when they can literally handle double that. Not to mention that the Infinity Fabric can go significantly faster too, I've heard 2400MT/s is possible. Timings arn't very important, it's mostly a bandwidth thing.  The 8700G is too expensive to be worthwhile, but yeah, the 8600G is a little slept on IMO. Having only 16MB L3 does make gaming kinda stuttery, and it doesn't boost very high because it's mobile silicon.  Note: the bandwidth limitations of iGPUs is exactly why Intel used to have ~128MB of L4 cache on some mobile chips (and the i7-5775C), which would catch a lot of the iGPU bandwidth.

AMD,o7b0box,">girlfriend using a Ryzen 8600G... expecting disaster and this thing just ran Forza Horizon 5 at 1080p medium without even blinking  Even my 7800X3D with its two compute units of RDNA 2 is surprisingly powerful. Enough to run Forza Horizon 5 at 720p if you really had to (there are benchmarks in one of my reddit posts). Most excellent for powering my 1080p second monitor with all of its browsers, Steam, Discord, and even the Windows GUI itself all while leaving my DEDICATED graphics card DEDICATED to a single game on a single monitor...  Meanwhile people just seemingly by default disable their CPU's graphics in BIOS throwing away this extra compute power.

I assume there’s just some architectural differences that allow the APU to have a bit more oomph when it comes to gaming specifically.   Then you have the steam deck and all these other handhelds emerging, essentially doing what you’re talking about, but in the palm of your hand.

Seriously, 12 year old budget GPUs that you can find used for $35 on ebay will outperform most iGPUs today.  The 10 year old 1060 cards can beat nearly any iGPU on the market.  They are fine if you don't need much.  They are fine if you are on a razor thin budget.  But pretending like they are capable of any real performance is just not real.  Find a friend that likes to build PCs and take any old junky GPU they have lying around and it will be an improvement.  Trust me, they will more than likely have 2 or 3 old GPUs gathering dust somewhere.  Now, I don't believe this will be the case for much longer.  Nvidia is looking to do some wild stuff, and intel and amd will have to respond in some way, but i'd also expect CPUs with much better iGPUs will also cost considerably more than current iGPU CPUs.

When you have the CPU and iGPU fighting for the TDP limit, something has to give. Usually the iGPU gets shafted, then the CPU starts throttling as the machine heat soaks.  My personal laptop is in that boat. The AMD Ryzen 2500U in it has a configurable TDP. It's set to 15w because the laptop's VRM and cooling can't handle the chip at the max TDP. But the chip itself can perform much, much faster. The BIOS also artificially caps the performance lower when on battery, with no real way to override it.

And Optiscaler can easily get you banned in many online games. I don't see how you can't make a disclaimer like this without beint downvoted.",pcmasterrace,2026-02-24 22:56:44,-1

Or just flick the setting in AMD Adrenalin? Do you want me to record this?   On the Z2 Go, in Balanced power, you dip below 30 fps, period. You can play with LS or without, it doesn't matter. The only thing that boosts frame rate is LSFG. In Performance mode, you can get 35 fps but this is not consistent.  Indeed, the consistent low frame rate is strange. I am surprised by this too. Only power modes affect the performance. But this is beyond my scope.

RAM has always been expensive but they haven’t been raising the price (yet)  Now that everything’s on one chip we’ll see what they do. They’re not reliant on a million vendors for their parts. The performance has made their hardware quality/performance ratio a good value IMO.   Also! All their RAM is part of the same chip. So if you have 128GB RAM, you immediately have 128GB VRAM. So it’s great for AI and stuff that you can use lots of offline modeling on your own. I’ve used a lot of AI stuff offline and it’s pretty cool. My gaming PC with a 4090/24GB RAM is WAY faster at offline AI workloads but I still use my M1 MacBook Pro with 64GB RAM because it’s more convenient to load in models that are much bigger. The models can spill into swap too which is cool.   I’m not an expert about gaming APIs but it seems to me there are some unique advantages to the Apple platform for gaming. Chiefly, convenience for most people I think. Who are sitting there with their M4 MacBook Pros with a full fledged GPU inside them essentially, and they know it, but have nothing to do with it.

RDNA 4 is a big leap in terms of transistor count over RDNA 3; to compare two 32 CU GPUs the RX 9060 XT has 29 billion transistors vs the RX 7600's 13 billion.  A lot of those extra transistors went to ray tracing hardware + a side of supporting higher clock speeds.    Mobile iGPUs aren't going to be fast enough for heavy ray tracing games even if they included the RT hardware, and obviously clocks are limited on mobile platforms for power use reasons.  On the flipside though, better hardware upscaling is appealing for low end GPUs.

I really want to see the CCDs and overall architecture act in a more cohesive way. CCDs make sense for server/datacenter, since those operations are exceedingly parallel, almost to a fault.  Gaming, not so much. There are thread spawns with dependencies that can't be on a different CCD currently.  AMD may have to move to grouped CCDs where two to four form a Super Compute Cluster (SCC). These can be tightly linked dies that can communicate and act as one previous CCD. To link them, they simply need to be rotated to where the edge communication connect is (two sides for server or one side for consumer). It can be decently high bandwidth, matching at least local L3 bandwidth. The great thing here is that this also works for server/datacenter operations, but the real winner is us: consumers. Of course, SCCs can accept V-Cache underneath with clever routing.  The cluster can then accept thread spawns with dependencies across any core with the only cost being latency on farthest cores (some firmware and thread schedulers can handle that). A hardware thread scheduler would be nice, but only necessary for mixed core or hybrid silicon. So, if we have 2x standard 12-core CCDs in a single SCC, it'd operate like a large, unified 24-core CPU.  I wouldn't expect this until AM6, sadly.",AMD,2026-02-21 23:48:26,1

Not necessarily because of chiplets or chip-to-chip communication, but because of the inherent types of things CPU's do in games that you cant necessarily parallelize and how it's still beneficial to have certain primary tasks being handled by a single core or two, while there's not always a ton left to distribute across the rest of the cores.  Like, you could theoretically distribute some things across even more cores, but it's pointless when you're not actually coming close to saturating any of them.

Amdahl's law is a simple math that can tell you much performance improvement you can get by adding more cores, and can help us understand diminishing returns.  Lets say 90% of an app's work will multithread perfectly. That is, if you run it on an 8 core machine, that work'll be 8x as fast as on a 1 core machine.  That 10% that can't multithread perfectly is dragging you down \*a lot\*. On an 8 core machine, your overall app will be running only about 5x as fast. On a 32 core machine, it'll run about 8x as fast.  Bump that number up to 99%: by 32 cores you are still only going 24x as fast. Games don't get near even 90%. Most software doesn't get near 90%.  So, outside of some very very specific games with embarassingly parallel workloads, a 24 core CPU will not really help gamers over a 16 core CPU.

Pick a distro that seems to come pre-packaged with what you want and go from there. At the end of the day, you'll still be able to run the same desktop environments and software. Don't like the desktop environment your distro came with? Install something else -- you don't have to reinstall the whole OS to swap if you don't want to.  If someone doesn't know where to start, just pick one that seems popular if for no other reason than it'll likely be easier to find solutions to problems you'll run into learning the new environment. Or ask for recommendations based on what they want to do. For someone on this subreddit, I would almost always recommend something like Bazzite for most cases just due to the gaming focus and image-based nature.

AMD,o6p5qis,"Steve very briefly alluded to something that I want to bring up because I think some people have really short memories, and this certain something really bothered me.    AMD initially did not want and did not allow Ryzen 5000 series cpus to work on the 300 series chipset AM4 boards.  A lot of people praise AMD for the AM4 platform, but I do not think this is really deserved.    AMD has to release a bios ""blob"" to the motherboard manufacturers, who use that to make bios updates for their boards.  When Ryzen 5000 cpus were released they would not work on the A320, B350, and X570 boards.  BIOS updates for those did not exist, and it was AMd's fault.  AMD was giving the most loyal customers of theirs, the early Ryzen adopters, a big middle finger.  They wanted people to upgrade motherboards instead.    Ryzen 5950X review from HUB was on  Nov 5, 2020  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30)  BIOS updates for the 300 series chipsets was announced in March of 2022 and started being available in May 2022.  [https://www.techpowerup.com/292955/amd-brings-official-ryzen-5000-support-to-300-series-chipset-motherboards-circa-2016](https://www.techpowerup.com/292955/amd-brings-official-ryzen-5000-support-to-300-series-chipset-motherboards-circa-2016)  That was a huge gap in time.  Was it really a technical issue?  I don't think it was.  AMD wanted people to upgrade boards, like what Intel does.  I think AMD's reversal of their initial decision was not done out of the goodness of their hearts.  The people who had 300 series chipset boards who wanted a cpu upgrade had to upgrade their board.  If you had to upgrade your board, why not consider all possibilities, as in why not also consider Intel?  LGA 1700 cpus were faster for gaming, so why not get one of those?  I think AMD realized people were jumping ship to Intel so they finally released the bios update to manufacturers.  The point is that they were not trying to do the right thing for their customers.  In my opinion they don't deserve so much credit for the long lifespan of the platform as everyone gives them.",AMD,2026-02-22 01:21:26,215

Basically none of these low-cost boards had support for updating the BIOS without a processor installed.  This creates a support problem that AMD probably wanted to avoid.  I doubt the board partners were complaining about the prospect of people being forced to buy new motherboards, either.  In the end, what AMD wanted to avoid wasn't what their customer base wanted, so they had to take on the support burden to allow Zen 3 to run on those old AM4 boards with low BIOS capacity.",AMD,2026-02-22 05:59:53,97

AMD,o71vycx,"i guess i'm imagining the plethora of asrock boards that had bios updates made available that allowed the 300 series boards to have 5000 support essentially at/prior to launch... which kinda throws a wrench into the overall claim, leaving a combination of it being ""amds fault"" paired with board vendors.  there's something that needs to be addressed, and either willfully omitted or simply attempting to gaslight perhaps.... not sure, but if you're going to go to the extent of elaborating, odd that you'd make a point of neglecting to mention the variables at play and insisting on painting the purely negative picture you want people to ""remember"". One should be aware that as i mentioned, there were several bioses that launched in tandem with the ryzen 5000 series that were then immediately pulled, the reason, well of course it was entirely amd's fault, let's not consider the variables at play. Even for a small business doing deployments, things have to be validated and verified, a task that can take months to years depending on the context and circumstances. The same limitations and restrictions that applied to past sockets that allowed for significantly newer cpus that weren't initially even thought of had similar limitations and delayed bios/product support out of the box, some boards never to receive it because they never completely supported it. So let's play out the realistic circumstances of those variables, and this isn't in defense of a company that so many will immediately cast aside as fanboism or something, but the logic and reasoning for imposing a restriction in order for curb failures or catastrophic issues due to lack of proper testing and validation, or failing to perform up to the standards expected, nothing like getting hauled into court, potentially a class action lawsuit due to the newer cpus failing to operate properly as advertised on old initially released am4 boards, or worse, discovering that many were turned into paperweights, possibly loss of data among other hardware for blindly supporting it out of the box. It really bothers me that there's always the group of people, with the insane mentality that everything has a nefarious purpose and reason, that there isn't any logical or reasonable explanation beyond their own narrow mindset that it's always for the dollar, that there is nothing else making the decisions overtly. Do board vendors want to sell newer boards, definitely, no differently than a laptop manufacturer wanting to sell more laptops, the desire is for some form of obsolescence to occur, be it support or lifespan due to failure or whatever. NO one is discounting that as a significant variable, but the paint the entire premise that it's EXCLUSIVELY this is either pure ignorance at play, or willful intellectual dishonesty.",AMD,2026-02-24 00:39:39,8

Oh man ... they had a good reason for it, that makes a lot of sense, if you see it from a company perspective. And no, it was not about money or being evil.  First of all, they never guaranteed how long the socket and chips would be supported. They wanted to try at least 3 gens or so, but as this was a whole new platform, nobody knew.  And here comes the kicker and the real issue, why it didn't work with the older boards - or better said, why AMD didn't want to support it on older chips.  When Ryzen launched in 2017, AMD suggested 16 mib memory for the UEFI - or at least didn't enforce more. When the 5000 series came upon us, this resulted in an issue, as they couldn't foresee at the time in 2017, that 16 mib are not enough to support the new CPUs. Or that they would run AM4 for so long with so many different CPU types. Mind you, they were almost bankrupt and Ryzen saved their ass.  So they had two options. Cut the old / first Ryzen boards and only support newer - with larger roms. Or risk a shit storm and support hell, if they support the older boards - BECAUSE PEOPLE CANT / WONT READ UPDATE INFORMATION. And just ask yourself who would've been blamed for it...  After the community forced AMD to give the old Chipsets the new CPU support, it happened as I said. People didn't read, upgraded their Mainboard and couldn't use their old 1800x anymore, because they ignored the warning, that the bios dropped support and there are two different bios. One for the new CPUs, one for the older ones.  Or they bought a new CPU, sold the old one already and couldn't boot to upgrade the Mainboard for the right firmware.  Don't you guys not remember the threads here about it? And I still remember how pissed some were because of it and what a shit show this was, from their perspective.  And AMD even had to resort to an RMA system, where they sent out older CPUs for people to upgrade the boards or newer ones, to downgrade. And this was all because of this issue.  AMD did not try to fuck over anyone or saw the possibility to screw people over. Yes, it's a company and not a charity. Yes, they need to make money,  enforced by the shareholders.  But please get the facts straight. Even back then everyone was raging about it and didn't even for one second think about it objectively and in regards of a company.

With one the gamer and enthusiastic market as support, they didn't have the funds - thanks to Intel - to actually go toe to toe.  And this is not some conspiracy stuff, this happened. Mind you - at that time, Intel had more profit as AMD had sales. Intel was larger in sales as the next 5 companies in the same sector combined.  AMD got lucky, that TSMC steamrolled Intel and Intel fucked up their node long term. This gave AMD the upwind and time they needed to come back and overtake them. Showing people that they can deliver.  But in the bad decade with bulldozer, the GPU part saved their ass, but also bleed dry. They also had some strategy mishaps IMHO. But one of the main reasons, their GPU part is worse than Nvidia is, that they bleed so much knowledge and top tier engineers and devs, that it was impossible for them to keep at a high level.  And especially in this kind of sector you can't throw money at problems. It takes time to get devs and engineers back and them up to speed. Coding GPU drivers is everything, but not easy.  Also - many tend to forget - even today AMD is TINY compared to Nvidia or Intel. In sales, profit and employee numbers. And this was way worse in 2017, when Ryzen hit. Imagine half the employees of Nvidia and maybe 1/4 of Intel. And they had negative cash flow at that time, for years. And still doing GPU, CPU AND SOC for consoles.  Honestly, it's a miracle that they survived this till Ryzen hit and even could overtake Intel and get some serious foot into the server market now.  The only downside to them is, that they lack a good GPU lead with a solid vision and a larger software development team.  Also their PR team is the worst on the planet. They take too long to respond, tell way too much bullshit and so on.  They need some serious community managers in social media that can give solid answers, replys (fast ones) without clearing everything with the law department.

That’s probably similar behaviour for even 9800x3D on boards with multiple NVMe slots and USB4 controllers.  I read about some other motherboards where they have a secondary full slot that only runs x8 natively so you can put the graphics card in that instead of the main slot if you want to force x8.  Some where they offer more NVMe slots but as you populate some it deactivates others etc. It’s a good point that maybe AMD didn’t see the issue as PCIE-5 has a lot of bandwidth so we aren’t close to saturating it for GPU’s.

The Ryzen 7 350 is actually included in their list and ranks dead last in the multicore comparison so there's that and in the single core comparison Lunar Lake generally performs better than both but once again the Ryzen 7 350 is beaten by panther lake.  They even include a nice graph for different PL which also happens to include the Ryzen 7 PRO 350.,Intel,2026-01-26 18:00:04,2

I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable?

AMD,nyimhf2,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Here are some examples:   -Intel’s 32nm Sandy Bridge came after the early 32nm CPUs (dual-core i3/i5 300/500 series and the 6-core 980X), and Sandy Bridge turned out to be an excellent overclocker.   -22nm Ivy Bridge and Haswell were mediocre in that regard, while Haswell-E (a more mature implementation) overclocked better. Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.   Overall, higher clock speeds tend to come from node maturity and refinement, not from the first use of a new manufacturing process, and I believe 5.8ghz could have been possible if intel used its own 10nm process node on ARL considering its HyperThreadingless.",Intel,2026-01-16 04:43:25,1

AMD,o4r7vk6,"u/Phaldaz, upon checking, the graphics update for the Intel® Graphics for Intel® Core™ processors (Series 2) will contain the following:  \- Driver improvements for Arc iGPU (graphics performance, game compatibility)   \- NPU software stack updates (AI acceleration libraries, framework support)   \- General software optimizations that aren't hardware-dependent  However, you would need to consider that the following will not be included on the driver update:  \- Hardware-level architectural improvements (new instruction sets, hardware security features)   \- Significant performance gains that rely on new silicon design   \- Power efficiency improvements tied to manufacturing process changes  If you're primarily looking for good performance now and aren't concerned about having the absolute latest features, a Series 2 laptop could be a smart buy. You'll get most software improvements, and the money saved could offset any performance differences.

All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Intel,2025-11-13 16:13:13,53

I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Intel,2025-11-13 20:08:27,11
AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Intel,2025-11-29 11:19:13,4

The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . .

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Intel,2025-12-14 14:40:19,2
