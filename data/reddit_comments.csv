Those gens still will get driver updates but AMD gave up on trying to implement FSR4 on them, like the leaked scripts earlier this year had performance reduction from 20% to up to 30% FPS to use FSR4 for 6000 series cards since they don't have the hardware and just using brute force software for FSR4.

No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",hardware,2025-10-10 15:13:44,4

Intel,nito8rq,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",hardware,2025-10-10 19:19:56,-3

Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64.

On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

Intel,ne6f8e1,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",hardware,2025-09-14 15:10:44,33

Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",hardware,2025-09-14 20:51:40,9

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",hardware,2025-09-18 03:04:06,9

The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown.

So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,8
Intel,ney7oxo,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",hardware,2025-09-18 20:16:47,4

When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",hardware,2025-07-03 17:17:52,-1

Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.

We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

Just a quick search on ebay and sold listings are showing an average of $300-350, with some at $400 or more as a bundle with motherboard and RAM.   For not much more money, at around $550, you can get a 9600X, a B850 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5.   If RAM prices weren't skyrocketing like they currently are, you could have gotten a basic AM5 setup for around $450 a few weeks ago. Some of the price hike can be explained by RAM chips being purchased for AI, due to many many data centers popping up all over major cities. But also can be explained by the upcoming holiday season in a few short weeks. Its a common trend now - you can use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel or PCPartpicker to look at the pricing trend.   Its not really ideal to move to AM4, especially buying brand new parts - the cost difference is in AM5's favor even with the DDR5 price hike. Any better CPU upgrade down the line would require you to jump to a new platform anyway, which means CPU/MOBO/RAM at a minimum.   Hell, if you're willing to wait a few weeks to see what the holiday ""sales"" bring. (more people are becoming aware that a few weeks before the holiday season price hikes tend to happen so that things like Black Friday and Christmas sales make you believe you're getting a good deal)  Starting off with something like the 9600X build I listed below will give you far more longevity, and the socket itself will have 1 or 2 more CPU generations so you'll still have an upgrade path even if something like AM6 comes out.

So take the left cpu fan and attach it on the very right of the cpu heatsink right above the ram slots as push fan, and the attack the middle cpu fan onto the other tower so it primarily pushes air into the second tower, and pulling air from the first (right) tower is secondary.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",AMD,2024-08-02 03:44:51,1
Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,67

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.   Im damn sure (and I did this before with people at my home) that if I provide you with a game blind testing it with DLSS and Frame Gen, along with other games with those features on and off, you wont be able to notice at all.",AMD,2024-04-02 10:10:50,5

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6

Intel,k75quo4,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,AMD,2023-10-30 23:36:30,3

It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using.

You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,AMD,2023-10-31 07:28:35,5

We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it.

Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets.

Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible?

Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.

But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads.

Intel,niy0ck1,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Intel,2025-10-11 16:21:28,1

Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Intel,2025-10-11 19:15:30,1

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.

Intel,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1

Its fast, highly efficient, and unless the streaming platform you're streaming on even allows you to have a bitrate thats in the 10,000-12,000+ to run higher resolutions where the bitrate would actually matter.... CPU rendering is useless. The only streamers that even have such bitrates available to stream at, at the ones who are pulling in tens thousands of viewers each stream, whom are on a consistent schedule that justifies the platform in unlocking that ability. And even most of those aren't game streamers, they're talking heads with a mostly static image coming from their $800+ DSLR face cam.   The average streamer, even if you run a podcast that has 1-5k viewers every stream... are usually locked to 6000 and below. I think on Twitch you're limited to a bitrate of 3500 and only until you meet certain thresholds will they even allow you to hit 6000.

AMD,nlkyzwy,"Hmmm, let's  think.  The Ultra 9 is on a platform that has no future, it's ""dead"", there is no opportunity to drop in the next gen Intel cpu.  The Ultra trails both your current cpu in many games and it trails many of the AMD cpu's.   The Ultra is obliterated by the AMD x3d chips.    The one advantage the Ultra has is in productivity apps.  The 9950x3d goes toe to toe with the Ultra 9 in productivity apps:  a little faster in some, a little slower in others.  The Ultra cannot compare with the 9950x3d in gaming.  The vcache side of 9950x3d is actually a 9800x3d. The 9950x3d also obliterates the Ultra in gaming, because, well it is a 9800x3d when gaming.  Both the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d are on the AM5 platform.  AMD will run its next generation of cpu's, Zen6, on the AM5 platform.  Reliable sources report that Zen7 will also be AM5.  If you go with a chip setting on the AM5 platform (e.g. 9950x3d), you have the opportunity to simply drop in a Zen6 then a Zen7 cpu and have a modern and relevant machine for another 5+ years.  Intel only dreams of this!  The price delta between the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d is about $200.  If you have any doubts, get the 9950x3d.   Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.    I was considering a 9800x3d vs a 9950x3d, I went with the 9950x3d.   Precisely because I want to know I have the flexibility to do more than game.  From a price to performance ratio for gaming, the 9800x3d is the winner.

The other problem was manufacturing defect - something about corrosion within the die so you'd have a permanently gimped CPU that no amount of undervolting and capping clockspeeds would ever help.   Might be time to RMA the CPU and get a fresh one from Intel - if yours is still within the warranty period. I would try this option first before trying to replace the entire platform.

It has 32 threads vs the 16 threads on the 9800x3d  Sure the 9800x3d will get a fps boost from the 3d cache when gaming but outside of gaming the 13900k is faster per core and overall. Just look at single threaded and multi threaded core each r23 tests that put the cpus to the test. For multi threaded the 13900k scores in the 38,000 range and 9800x3d scores around 23,000    For single core it’s 2100 for the 9800x3d and 2300 for the 13900k  So technically the 13900k is a faster more capable chip due to having more cores and a good single threaded performance. The only place the 9800x3d will be an improved is in gaming fps thanks to the 3d cache. This is fine if all you do is game and want higher FPS but beyond that, it’s a slower chip in every other way than the 13900k.

AMD,nlnpv0q,"""some background apps"" amount to very little justification for having a 16core cpu. I think people overestimate what ""multitasking"" really means and think that you can only run a handful of apps before needing a CPU upgrade. RAM matters more to multi-tasking than CPU cores do - unless you actually use your PC to earn a living with - in which case, in a professional setting - yes, the 9950X3D is the BARE MINIMUM you'll want to use.   As a PC used 99% for gaming? No.   I have a 9800X3D and use my PC almost exclusively for gaming - occasionally i'll render or re-encode a video or two but im not running a game at the same time - I like being able to utilize my GPU at full-tilt of around 150fps when I'm re-encoding an 80GB 4K movie down to 10GB so I can watch some movies while I travel. I run multiple browser tabs, discord, a torrent client and sometimes Jellyfin.  The only other stuff running in the background is the typical list of windows processes that everyone has running.   Discord and my browser are chillin on my 2nd monitor and they're basically idle while Im gaming on BF6 or playing Expedition 33. Maybe I have a podcast playing... but that doesnt even fully utilize 1 core.   Unless OP is running a VM or two and/or is actually multi-tasking by letting a video or blender rendering, or some CFD program... a 9950X3D is not going to benefit him at all.  OP's use-case is similar to mine. PC mostly used for gaming with only a handful of typical programs running in conjunction with the primary focus being on a game.  The adage of ""unused RAM is wasted RAM"" would fit perfectly if you swapped ""RAM"" with ""cores"". Unused cores is wasted cores. If OP is only going to be using no more than 6-8 cores... the extra 8 cores are just going to be sitting idle barely registering as a blip.

I noticed for your use case that you find yourself not gaming as much as you are running a VM and coding. For that, you'll want to consider an 8 or 16 core processor like the [Ryzen 7 5700X](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09VCHQHZ6) for $169 or [Ryzen 9 5900XT](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0D6NMCZG1) for $284. The X3D chips cannot be bought new as of now as far as I can tell, but for your use case, you should be fine with the non-X3D chips.  You would probably need to update the BIOS of your motherboard to support 5000-series chips. Your 2700X has the same TDP as the 5900XT (105W), so you should be fine with either chip.  If you have more money to shell out, AMD has stated that they would support and release chips for the AM5 platform through 2027. A [Ryzen 7 9700X](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0D6NMDNNX) would run you around $300, plus you would need to get a new motherboard and RAM, which would cost probably around $450-500, depending on parts.",buildapc,2025-11-01 05:12:58,0

You could be looking at another 5 years at least, before that makes sense, especially, again, since you already waited this long to even consider AM5.

I have moved Windows drives back and fourth across systems just fine and they didn't give me problems.     The only thing I know for SURE will not work is if Windows was installed with your drive controller set to a different mode than the system you are moving it to (E.G. you installed Windows with a drive controller set to RAID and you move it to a non-raid system, or vice-versa.) 99.99% of people are not going to have their controller set to RAID, especially for an OS drive, and if they did they likely knew what they were doing anyway, so this is unlikely to apply but I figured I would mention it as a warning just in case.

Or Hell Divers 2 that had issues at launch, or Dying light 2 that had RGB laser show bug outside the Radeon boost issues the game had for 1 and half year or so more or less.  As well as some unity based games having random driver timeouts on least RDNA3 due those games not handling the high clock speeds that well on stock.  They may be dropping support, but they never properly supported these gpu's to begin with and now RDNA3 we just waiting for games to be playable, by the time it gets fixed it wont matter anymore, i could not play wow for example during the entire Dragonflight expansion and wasted 200+ euros on a game and subscription that i could not play for almost entire expansion, so i am happy i can finally play it again.  Hopefully i can as well during midnight expansion which has its first beta on 11 november now.  The attitude AMD often has oh its just hardware issue 99% of the time its a driver issue and their vanguard program users unable to reproduce issues, simply due lack of information required to fix these issues, because sometimes its not easy to reproduce however for those having issues, avoiding the issue is as simple as simply not playing the game with the issue, as much that sucks.  And there is the Radeon tax you pay you only get to play what the vanguard program users like to play, you want to play that latest game that AMD has not enough users playing well tough luck and sometimes its also because NVIDIA simply makes the game unavaible until launch so AMD can only fix it as soon as its released, so NVIDIA wins by default because AMD cannot support the game to begin with at launch.     So yeah that AMD is just straight out saying they putting RDNA1/2 in Maintenaince mode not supporting the latest games really pisses me off, but its not like they doing that right now anyway even RDNA4 suffers from issues with games at launch.  But i will compliment AMD for finally working with game devs these days they been doing that for over a year or 2 now and probably longer, but they have to figure out how to do things better, because this is not acceptable.  I could litterally spend time making memes out of these driver issues and actual proof that these issues are actually real driver issues, but i do not like a burnout or work for free, which is why i rejected joining the vanguard program few times in the past, alto i have cooperated with some users figuring things out even testing things, but AMD should honestly do this them self.

Pretty much 2 years after they just dropped support and in that time NVIDIA has secured such a lead that the 9070 XT is around the performance of a 3060 and 3060 ti in rendering. 7900xtx without zluda is around 4060 tier, and 7900xtx with zluda was slightly below 4060 ti.)",AMD,2025-11-01 08:55:32,1

AMD was widely praised for using 16GB of VRAM in the 6000 series specifically because it would likely allow the cards to age well as VRAM became a larger consideration, by cutting driver support to maintenance mode they've now done they exact opposite.      The bigger issue is that this may hint that RDNA2 cards will not be receiving official FSR4 support, which would be a massive blow to customers with those cards because FSR4 is a significant improvement on previous iterations of the technology and we have proof, albeit unofficial, that RDNA2 cards can support FSR4 natively and gain significant benefit from it.",AMD,2025-10-31 15:27:58,11

And not like Nivida, oh the grass won't display well in that one game. No, 23.10.1, 23.10.2 and even 23.11.1 broke Hardware Acceleration completely.

Also I have completely dumped windows for Linux now (mostly pertaining to how I cannot control windows update when it comes to drivers, it seems to ignore everything I throw at it short of a group policy, even now I can’t do that because Microsoft disabled my pro key over the petty reason that they no longer allow upgrades from windows 7, 8 and 10 to 11.

Battlefield 6 just dropped and you can play it with almost any driver in the last 12 months and still get the expected performance based on benchmarks. The scope of dropping these optimizations for older cards doesn't seem as outrageous as it would be on Nvidia where games frequently have severe bugs or don't work without the Day One driver update (EX: Final Fantasy 16 on Nvidia).  I do forsee a problem though where if RDNA1 and 2 do not receive updates on a regular basis they might get gated out of launching a game with astonishingly lazy driver detection (like Warzone).,AMD,2025-10-31 20:19:05,2

OEMs do not want to write drivers for your hardware, they make little profit as is per machine, and long term support is not in their best interest. You will get a few drivers throughout the year if you are lucky, but their support is not going to be on the level of what AMD could provide. When the 780m came out from AMD, i was an early adopter in the form of the GPD Win Max 2 and many of the smaller OEMs had to battle AMD to start maintaining their drivers for their product as they did try and rug pull everyone with that ""OEM maintains drivers"" for a product none of them had architectural knowledge of.

RDNA2 cards get feature updates and optimizations through AMDGPU/Radv/Mesa (although recently radv and mesa combined) independent of Windows ‘Game Ready’/maintenance mode. Even the Steam Deck will keep getting Vulkan/driver improvements. So ‘maintenance mode’ on Windows doesn’t mean Linux support is frozen, the open source stack evolves on a different schedule and often keeps older cards performant for years. i.e the HD 7000 (from 2012) series is still receiving game patches on linux.",AMD,2025-10-30 21:12:06,22

AMD,nmckn01,Games are built with the generic APIs and hardware agnosticism in mind. A hardware vendor like AMD can always look at its driver to see if it can improve its interaction with the game to get additional performance out of it or if the game's implementation is conflicting somehow with the driver then see if it can be improved. In the vast majority of cases this doesn't result in big improvements but there have been cases in the past where driver patches greatly improved the performance or reliability of a game.,AMD,2025-10-31 10:51:54,6

AMD,nmjv9ch,"Sure, AMD funds part of the work, but Mesa and RADV aren’t AMD exclusive. Valve, Collabora, and others actively maintain cross architecture code, so RDNA2 still benefits from broader Vulkan and shader improvements. The open driver stack doesn’t stop evolving just because AMD moves on from Windows support.  Mesa and RADV are architecture agnostic in many areas.

It's not uncommon for RAM to be perfectly stable at X voltage and Y temperate, and very unstable just a little bit outside of that. It's not uncommon for MB makers to supply more voltage than they claim, because it generally helps with stability which reduces the cost of their returns and warranties. And it's not uncommon for instability to appear in only one specific place when your intuition tells you it should show up elsewhere too.  So my advice is test your RAM in cold and warm scenarios.

When using Relive, if I launch a game and record any gameplay using Relive, Adrenalin of course creates a folder for that game in the designated folder. For Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), it seemed to create a folder that has permissions issues, to put it lightly. I cannot delete the folder and I cannot play any media that's been recorded to it. If I copy or cut the media out into another folder, it plays fine.  Just recently the drive I have been using for Relive media has had issues, so I created a new folder for it on a seperate, newer NVME drive. I put the earlier issues down to just the drive failing and that Adrenalin wasn't at fault at all. I uninstalled Adrenalin, used DDU and did a completely fresh install. Only now, can you guess what has happened? Yep, the exact same thing. Media recorded in the Adrenalin-created Battlefront II folder does not play until cut or copied out of it, and despite my setting user permissions on the main base folder itself, I can't delete the damn thing. Last night it said I didn't have permission. Today, just trying now before writing this message, Windows is telling me the folder doesn't exist.  I'm worried about why this is happening yet again, on a seperate drive on a fresh install.

You don't get support for new things quite as immediately, and if you're on a slower moving distro, you might not get it for a while. Stuff like FSR 4 took a couple extra months to work on Linux, for instance. Also, because the HDMI forum is...

AMD,nm9i9yk,"This is what the AMD Stans can't seem to understand. As someone who's used both Radeon and GeForce stuff, I can tell you... NVIDIA even when they remove support, they just get it right from the beginning. With GeForce you get 99% of the performance day 1. Rather than waiting months for the full performance of my card, NVIDIA gives it basically right away.  The whole FineWine argument makes no sense to me, these cards have a limited shelf life, if the first 6 months you're getting gimped performance, how is that a good thing? These cards are only relevant for maybe 24 months and their support is maybe 6 years of support if you're lucky with AMD and more like 8 years with NVIDIA. If I have to wait 4-6 months to get the full performance of my card, then any money you saved buying AMD is basically mute imo. The extra $50-100 is worth getting the full performance day 1 rather than waiting months for it. Especially if the issue is making the device completely unusable.   Then take into account black screen issues, game issues, multi-monitor power usage and inconsistent driver updates where like you said AMD may not ship a driver every month. I just never understood the FineWine thing... Now I will be fair and say NVIDIA's drivers honestly haven't been the best with Blackwell, but they've been just bad relative to how they were with Ampere, Pascal, Turing etc. They're still a lot better than AMD's worst driver moments the past couple of years and they're no where near Intel's driver problems for GFX. So NVIDIA is still the better choice in terms of driver support and I will give AMD credit, they held back RDNA4 to work on drivers more and it helped them a lot.  Either way, I'm tired of this duopoly and the GPU industry in general, too many people not willing to call out the BS from any of these companies and all of them are just screwing consumers.

AMD,nlumf3x,"There were SKUs that had a third and even a fourth digit in previous generations like the 5825U (mind you that is a Barcelo part, which was basically a small refresh of Cezanne). But AMD really popularized it and introduced it with the 7000 series to provide ""clarity"" as to what architecture something is. Why did they do that? Because in that same 5000 series lineup they had a mix of Zen2 and Zen3 parts. Like the 5300U which was Lucienne architecture, which was Zen2, but the 5800U was Zen3 Cezanne.  But it's just stupid because with the 6000 series, everything was Zen 3+, so whether you bought a 6800U or a 6600U it was all Zen3+. It didn't matter what you picked and tbh that's how they should have carried on, only make the new stuff the new generation naming.  In the 7000 series though they went back to the 5000 series naming sort of because they decided to mix old architectures again with the new stuff. For example, the 7735HS a Zen 3 chip and the 7745HX a Zen4 chip, that one third digit is supposed to notify you that you're buy Zen4, therefore it was as an indicator as to what Ryzen generation you were buying, but it just confused consumers even more because some people thought a 7640HS was worse than a 7735HS, but in single core the 7640HS beat the 7735HS and in multi-thread both were about even.

AMD,nlts0kp,"The problem's that the moment these come onto the market isn't the moment every single older laptop gets wiped off the market, especially considering these are practically the same chips being re-released time and time again by AMD. Here's an example:  One customer looks at 5 budget laptops and their processors. #1 has a Ryzen 5 7520U, #2 has a Ryzen 3 7440U, #3 has a Ryzen 5 220, #4 has an older, discounted Ryzen 5 5600U, #5 has a Ryzen 5 40. Place your bets on the best one now.  Where do you even begin to compare these? Well, the Ryzen 5 7520U has a higher number than the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 5600U, so it should be better, right? Wrong. Both the 7520U and 7440U are 4-cores, 8-threads, but the Ryzen 5 7520U has a 15W TDP, 4MB of L3 cache, is Zen 2-based (from 2019), and has a Radeon 610M iGPU. Meanwhile, the 7440U has a 28W TDP, 8MB of L3 cache, is Zen 4-based (3 years newer), and has a Radeon 740M iGPU. It's going to be an order of magnitude faster than the chip that's a higher number than it. As for the Ryzen 5 5600U? It's a 6-core, 12-thread Zen 3 chip with a 15W TDP, 16MB of L3 cache, with a much inferior Vega 7 iGPU.  Okay... so the Ryzen 7520U is a no-go, and the Ryzen 7440U and Ryzen 5600U are kind of up for debate if you have a dGPU in these laptops (though absolutely pick the 7440U if the iGPU is the only form of graphics onboard). Well what's up with the Ryzen 5 40? What generation does that fall under? If the third digit of the 7000 series was architecture, and the first digit of the 5000 series was architecture, is the Ryzen 5 40... Zen 4 based? Well no, you're not supposed to know that, you're supposed to just believe it's a new chip. Well we know it's a Zen 2 4-core 8-thread with 4MB of L3 cache from the article, but this potential customer doesn't. They'll find it out if they research it, but by this point they're probably getting sick of researching CPUs when the vast majority of people know barely anything more than an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 being good, and an RTX graphics also being good. They most likely don't know anything about cores, architectures, TDP, or L3 cache, and probably just want a working laptop.  What about the, uh, Ryzen 5 220? That seems... probably a fair bit worse than the Ryzen 3 7440U and Ryzen 5 5600U going off the name and potentially being connected in naming scheme to the Ryzen 5 40, so it's worse, right? Nope. The Ryzen 5 220 is a 6-core, 12-thread, Zen 4-based, 28W chip with 16MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 740M graphics. A clear choice to pick that gets the best of both worlds with regards to the cores & cache of the older chip, and the newer architecture and iGPU of the newer chip.  Outside of this hypothetical scenario now, I want to add an honourable mention to compare to the Ryzen 5 220. I'd like to bring up the Ryzen AI 5 330, which is a Zen 5-based 4-core 8-thread 28W chip with 8MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 820M graphics. It's got less cores and less L3 cache than the Ryzen 5 220 and most likely will be worse in benchmarks [(and as a matter of fact, it is)](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6616vs6917/AMD-Ryzen-5-220-vs-AMD-Ryzen-AI-5-330), but despite this is a tier above (X20 v. X30) the 220, and very few will catch that the newer chip is worse than the older one. Even chips within this new naming scheme are inconsistent.  When these chips come out, the laptop market isn't going to have done away with the older chips for no good reason. [These chips are still out there](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Notebook-Keyboard-Professional/dp/B0FT3CR5VK), and customers looking for an AMD chip are gonna regret looking for one if they have to compare this kind of shit. This naming scheme's only a year old with the Ryzen AI 300 series, and the previous one (where the architecture was defined by the third digit) lasted two generations from 2023 to 2024. Pre-2023 laptops are perfectly usable for the average person and they're still going to be selling those laptops today, and god help anyone looking for an AMD laptop that has to deal with this naming BS. Intel's not much better with their 200V series but at least it looks like they're going to stay the course and keep using that naming scheme now that desktop and mobile are somewhat unified. AMD's just drunkenly driving off a cliff with their mobile naming scheme and landing on another cliff they'll drive off on in a year or two. Meanwhile, their desktop chips are very easy to understand in comparison. No random digit amount switching, no sneaky third digit signifying architectures, or any of that nonsense. The Ryzen 5 9600 is faster than the Ryzen 5 7600. Easy.",AMD,2025-10-28 13:40:55,22

AMD,nlxevge,"You can judge a CPU based on if it's a Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, or Ryzen 7, but that's not really a good idea beyond a generalization. A Ryzen 7 1800X is much worse than a Ryzen 5 7600. An Intel i7-870 is much worse than an Intel i3-12100.  Going past the obvious, a Ryzen 9 9900X is worse for gaming than a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and Ryzen 7 5700 is worse than a Ryzen 5 5600 (because the 5700 is a special chip - whereas usually chips like the 5600 are based off lower-clocked 5600Xs under the same architecture, the 5700 is based off the 5700G with PCIe 3.0 and much lower L3 cache. This continues with mobile hardware, from my comment above, with CPUs like the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 7520U. One is two architectures newer, with double the L3 cache, double the TDP, with higher clocks, and a better iGPU. You'd think it to be the Ryzen 5 of the same ""generation"" (7000U) but it's not.  Desktop CPUs are easier (most of the time, there's still chips like the Ryzen 7 5700 though) but what I was saying up above is that AMD is making their laptop CPU naming schemes hard by switching them up every few generations, and it's almost certainly intentional to mislead consumers.",AMD,2025-10-29 00:41:58,3

AMD,nmgk5ut,"Well AMD is doing a better job right now.   However I actually believe both manufactures have failed the APU market by not focusing more die space on things outside of the CPU core count.   The need for a bunch of relatively slow CPU cores is not what most of us wanted out of an APU.   8 simple fast CPU cores and a robust GPU would have been a better focus.   These days you need plenty of AI acceleration too.  Frankly the latest Strix APU's from AMD are a lot closer to meeting most users needs.   They still allocate a lot of space to CPU's but on the positive side the GPU is now robust and we have AI acceleration.  Of course Intels real failure is that they don't have a low power process which means they never had chips to put into NUC sized machines.   Even if they got the die allocation right, Intels chips would just run to hot.   So yeah AMD.   It would be even better if we had a high performance ARM based solution outside of Apple's.  Frankly Apple seems to know what to do with hardware these days (their software sucks but that is another manner) in a way that the other chip suppliers don't.

Not only does it give you more versatility in productivity scenarios, but it also makes games run more smoothly at the same time (and in some instances, makes the difference between a game even running or not at all).  Honestly would be nice if we could swap out our V-ram, or had unified ram and could use our M-board ram for the GPU as well.  Or better still, dedicate 2 ram slots to the CPU, and the other 2 ram slots (which are usually empty and useless since you lose performance running 4 sticks in most scenarios nowadays) are dedicated to the GPU as MOAR V-RAM.

More like RAM -> GPU. In some situations it will double your results. Admittedly for LLMs inference PCIe bandwidth is not THAT important (x4 4.0 so far seems to be sufficient) but it could make a difference in training.  >gpu can use more power and boost clocks to give you most performance when you need it  For LLMs it's primarily memory bandwidth that matters. Higher boost clocks mostly increase your electricity bill.

AMD,nm529gz,"I definitely agree on wishing vram was upgradable by the user. Perhaps in the future something like LPCAMM could provide that suitable interconnect. A 128-bit interface per module would mean that even the biggest modern busses only need to fit 4 of them.  As for unified memory, I don't think many people on these forums will like the road that takes us down. Like it or not, the future (at least near future) of that path is things like Lunar Lake, Apple Silicon, and Strix Halo. Those are all very impressive SoCs, but you may have to trade the ability to upgrade your GPU separately from the CPU to get your upgradable unified memory.  As for dedicating certain slots on the motherboard to each side, CPU and GPU, that gets you the worst of both worlds in some ways.

AMD,nm5j350,"How have I not hears of LPCAMM until now!?  Yeah, in an ideal world you would have M-board that has 3 separate chip sockets, one for your CPU, one for your unified RAM, and one for your GPU chip. It would probably look something like 3 CPU sockets.  Which would also make cooling very easy and scalable, something our current M-board layout didn't account for. They did account for development add-on cards however so it was a necessary step and an integral part of computer design history. However now that we've optimised general use computers to CPU, GPU, and RAM (ignoring storage, keeping that scalable with addon slots is definitely the way) I do definitely feel that new layout standard is due.  Of course that's an ideal world where CPU, GPU, and RAM manufacturers all agree on the same socket, we'd probably need some kind of modular M-board that allows the use of whatever Intel, Nvidia, AMD, etc.... GPU, CPU, and RAM sockets each company invents, otherwise you'd get stuck in a closed ecosystem where you're at the whim of the manufacturer of wether you're allowed to have more RAM or a more powerful GPU or a more efficient CPU or not.  Though it's nice to dream of a more optimal computer layout (of course my personal take is to have the CPU and GPU on opposite sides of the M-board, that way they each get their own separate airflow, and also the backside of each socket/slot can get some extra passive cooling which would help with the higher and higher clock speeds our chips are now reaching).  It is the worst of both worlds, however it is highly scalable and if the GPU had it's own dedicated memory controller then it could work as an alternative where you have double the memory, but each chip only sees half of that memory. I imagine in high-demand dynamic workloads where the CPU wants more RAM one second, then the GPU wants more ram the next, that having separated RAM for each chip could become a benefit and act as a safety margin. Though I do agree that it's probably not the best idea and would require just as much of a redesign as unified RAM would.  Unless you just put RAM stick slots on the GPU (probably a really good use case for LPCAMM as that would allow you to maintain the same backplate clearance standard current GPU's are built to) then independent scalable RAM would just be a direct upgrade to our current layout as-is.  Though I definitely want discrete chips on an M-board with unified memory (and probably some extra silicone chip, hell you could probably split the traditional rasterisation GPU chip and the RT/AI/Tensor/etc... chip into separate sockets) cause that would mean having 3-4 AIO's on your board with nothing else and that would just look too cool imho.",AMD,2025-10-30 07:29:00,1

AMD,nl3pn0n,"Not in the context of VRAM. You have two boxes 32cm long. Can you fit 45cm long figurine? Answer is no, it will just hit the side of one of the boxes. You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.  So yea, 2x32GB in PC world can sometimes mean it's still 32GB :)",AMD,2025-10-24 08:29:58,20

They have one of the smallest form factor compared to other ChiNUCs and are bare-bones, which is exactly what I'm after. The question is, does Sapphire deliver in the quality department?

If the entire market is overpriced... that's exactly why prices would be likely to come down (not soothsaying here, just saying there's a rationale for it).

I've been following the scene since the start of the year now and originally tried the Acemagic F3A but wasn't satisfied with the build quality and company history. MinisForum's AI X1-Pro I ruled out because of of the speakers, size and bad PR on the MiniPC sub from high amount of bad RMA posts. The Ser9 I ruled out due to the weird internal design, speakers and bad wifi due to the full metal case. From what I remember, they use a extension board for the front and that is the reason why only of the USB-C ports is USB4.  The Edge AI 370 will likely be the cheapest option for me amongst reputable companies when it comes to 64GB of RAM. Additionally, I have 2x Western Digital Black 1TB NVMe's laying around that I plan to slap into that thing. One for Windows, one for Linux. Overall, I much prefer sourcing the parts myself. The size also became a big bonus, because it's meant to be a mobile workstation. Those few centimeters mean a lot.  I'll likely stresstest it when I get it and share my finding with the mini PC sub.

This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1

The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache.

L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it.

Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.

I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

Modern Intel processors, especially those in laptops like your Dell Pro 14, are designed to automatically park (turn off) cores when they're not needed to save battery life and prevent overheating. Your processor has 10 cores total, and Intel's smart technology decides which ones to use based on what you're doing, it doesn't need all cores running just for web browsing or light tasks. The cores will automatically wake up when you run demanding software that actually needs them. This core parking feature is intentional and helps your laptop run cooler, quieter, and with better battery life.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly.

There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked. So far it has worked everywhere with dark text on light images, and it's worked very well.",Intel,2025-09-08 03:35:58,1
AMD,ndttm3h,I'm now on the new BIOS (with Intel default settings) and the crashing is still occurring on Core 8. Alas... I was really hoping that would fix it.  What are the next steps?,Intel,2025-09-12 15:01:43,1
AMD,n5i13kx,"u/Hippieman100 Ah, I see I overlooked that part! Looks like this is the installer version, my apologies for the confusion since we were discussing three different software options earlier.  Alrighty, since you're using the latest version now, how can I help? Are you running into any issues with the new application, or is there a specific feature that's not working as expected?",Intel,2025-07-27 21:14:17,1
AMD,n5why78,"u/TheCupaCupa Great to hear it fixed itself! If it happens again, trying Turbo off sounds like a good plan.",Intel,2025-07-30 01:29:50,1
AMD,navj4sy,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Intel,2025-08-27 01:58:06,1

AMD,nd1z8qe,"Yeah switching fonts, I haven't tried it. But in windows settings you can change its size and such. Try looking at the Microsoft community or support changing it. But I am glad that adjusting the gamma helps.",Intel,2025-09-08 09:03:40,1

AMD,navjsxu,"Thank you for the reply. Sadly asrock doesn’t have a QVL for nvme drives in U.2 form factor or enterprise grade drives, just m.2. Let alone a QVL for VROC support. Looks like I’ll be the test subject for this.",Intel,2025-08-27 02:02:02,1
AMD,nbknxhv,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology. My phone is 4 years old and was absolutely not capable (Samsung S20+)",Intel,2025-08-30 23:14:21,1

AMD,ndh3cnl,"Just wanted to follow up for anyone seeing this or is in a similar boat. I can confirm that Intel DC P4510 drives will work in a VROC Raid using a standard key.      Not sure if intel support can confirm but it appears the ASROCK X299 Taichi CLX supports VROC Raid across multiple VMD Domains, which is supposed to be locked behind Xeon scalable CPU/Chipsets. I need to buy two more drives and try to add them to my array to confirm.",Intel,2025-09-10 16:37:36,1
