Intel,n1sr0i1,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working. Those will be some absolutely sad little GPUs.",hardware,2025-07-07 12:41:55,3

Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",hardware,2025-07-03 17:17:52,-1

We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful.

I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.  Like for Strix Halo, I think it'd do best for MoE's but there's not much at the 30GB or so size (if you have 2X, I'd Llama 4 Scout Q4 (58GB) might be interesting once there are better tuned versions.",hardware,2025-05-20 09:28:26,2

If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.

I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,10

The bigger deal is that intel has announced some pretty heavy changes and cuts coming and there is good speculation that intel's gpu sector might be cut.

Except for the vram department, the 9060 xt is pretty much better in every way and performs better too.  Was on the same boat with you. The b580 was $360 CAD, and the 9060 xt 8gb was $380. After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet.

Intel,n93bgu5,"Has driver issues with more dated and/or less popular games, but they've made it a point that major AAA titles and esports games usually have good drivers. It also basically requires a fairly beefy CPU and it will at least slightly negatively impact the CPU performance too. But when I say fairly beefy I basically just mean AM4 5000 series or basically any AM5 CPU even the 7500f, I personally don't know the Intel comparison but I imagine any Core Ultra or 12th gen would absolutely crush it and be fine.  But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs. Although FSR4 and the better raytracing on the 9000 series might've changed that, a lot of those comparisons were from when we were still comparing to the RTX4000 and RX7000 cards.",buildapc,2025-08-16 23:42:39,0

Intel,n94duvw,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

If you have to load half of the model to system memory it is gonna decrease your speed significantly. And guess what?

Intel,n4j4ewg,"Driver support in games is very good these days, I have had considerably more issues on my NVIDIA PC than on my arc PC, over the last six months or so (I've also used that one more but still felt like a worse overall experience in terms of gaming drivers). Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",buildapc,2025-07-22 14:26:29,6

I appreciate intel's clean and intuitive driver GUI. I love the way the driver handles crashes, it's exemplary. The driver literally invites to try out some OC. Don't regret my B580. If I'd buy a new card right now, I'd be torn apart between B580 or 9060 XT.   But my main goal was/is a decent gaming experience with a  reasonable power consumption.

You can save on the cooler for now, use the stock one (comes with a 7600) until she has enough saved for an upgrade.  The Intel Arc A750 is certainly a contentious choice. The only reason I'd go arc at that price point is if she'll be doing a lot of high res video editing, otherwise I'd look at alternatives, possibly second hand. A 3060 12GB would be a nice to have for 3D as NVidia is completely dominant in that space, but you'd probably need some second hand luck; I find them for around 200 EUR in the Netherlands. It'll perform a bit better than the A750 in gaming too, and has way better software support.

Intel,n4aiete,I have the Steel Legend B580 and Ive had corruption and cold crashes with Hitman 3 and the latest drivers removed my optimizations as the features were gone!  So it has been frustrating if not annoying however it makes me sad to get rid of it like the others say when it works nice thats nice.  I'm calling the B580 a hassle but its not junk its simply not getting top tier support for layered driver support.   Bought the Sapphire Pulse 9060XT OC 16Gb and it matches is little siblin' the 6600XT OC i still use on my second PC.  Hitman 3 for me went from 127 FPS down to at least 60 fps with the former Tessellation off.  The Radeon is everything the B580 promises actually.  The AI cores on the B580 were interesting.

See this damn card had a driver update while I had it that improves the performance and that's good its what we want but once the features drop and performance drops (for me anyway) after the next driver update I had to call it.  Its the poor driver software stack.  The hardware has serious potential!  A770 is maxed.  I see this B580 ownership  as I leased the card for the summer +$60.

Intel,n6ses8s,"Honestly? If I were you I’d get a 9060xt 16gb for 350-370 and then enjoy your $400 saved.  Reason being that with your setup, once you start moving up in GPU, you’re not gonna see as big of a performance uplift because of your 5700x, which will start to slightly but noticeably bottleneck a 9070/5070 or above  Which if you did go with a 9070/5070, say you get one for $600, you’d need a new PSU, which is around $70-$100. And at that point, it’s not worth paying $300 extra for a 25-30% performance uplift at 1440p because thats a 50-60% price increase.  You could upgrade your CPU sure, but then at that point, with a new CPU/RAM/MOBO/GPU and Power Supply, that’s basically just building a whole new PC, and you’re not gonna be able to do that for under $800, nor should you because again, the price increase isn’t worth the performance increase.  If I were in your shoes, I’d get the 9060xt 16gb and ride out the rest of my PC for 4-5 more years playing at 1440p. After that, if Im unsatisfied with the performance and frames im getting in games, I’d sell it/keep it as a spare and start from scratch a brand new build ground up. And with the $400 youre saving today, why not get some games, a peripheral upgrade, a second monitor, or shit you could always just pocket and save it.

Intel,n40tox6,"While drivers have gotten a lot better Arc especially Alchemist still has the occasional issue, but it is very rare in gaming these days. I've noticed though that Adobe's software really doesn't play nicely with Arc Alchemist, so if you're using applications like photoshop or after effects that's something to keep in mind. You're also looking at more CPU overhead, so if you have a weaker CPU it might not be the best idea.   I also don't know how much I'd trust Intel with long term driver support for the a750. Their GPU division is on shaky legs and given that arc alchemist was never that popular I wouldn't wager a lot on them spending a lot of resources on long term support    On the flip side you get much better ray tracing performance with the a750 (although not really relevant for either card in this performance tier imo), a vastly superior upscaler (xess runs on AMD cards but looks and performs considerably worse than natively on Intel) and a bit more rasterized performance.

AIOs have pump failures, in rare cases can leak, have lower useful lives, are often significantly more complicated to fit in a case, and have annoying software supposedly. An air cooler is simple, lasts way longer, and failure is not catastrophic and is very obvious unlike an AIO where you have to investigate if it is a fan, pump or whatever and they don't leak.  I personally run a gen 1 Noctua NH-D15 on my Core i9-12900k and it does what I need. Some of the best air coolers are rated for up to 250+ watts (a Ryzen 5 is not getting anywhere close to that at all, probably up to 105W as far as I can see at maximum, but usually you are never touching that).

Intel,nbkicu3,">My idea is to upgrade the GPU to a RX 9070XT (most important factor being 16Gb VRAM)  a RX 9070XT would be about a 40% improvement in 1440p it's in the range where you really fell the boost.  is it worth is another question, up to you to know if 650-700€ for a 40% lift is enough.  in your own exemple of recommended spec you can play at 1440p High with a 3060 Ti and DLSS balance so the 3080 a still lots of life for that resolution and I would keep it. The only reason I changed mine is because I brought a 4K screen in the mean time.  >and to swap my RAM for a DDR4-3600 CL18 (32Gb) kit.  I would not invest in DDR4 ram at that point, better to keep the money aside for the next CPU/RAM/MB update.",pcmasterrace,2025-08-30 22:40:47,2

Intel,nbosxmn,"Personally I probably wouldn't move from 3080 to 9070XT - while it is an upgrade, I don't think it's good enough upgrade to justify current pricing.  I agree what someone else here said, that saving up for a new platform (AM5 - to also upgrade RAM from 16 to at least 32GB) would be wiser for now as I have RTX 3080 12GB and it works fairly well for 4K (obviously not ultra on everything, but generally even medium or high looks great these days + you can always use DLSS) and then maybe wait for Nvidia Super cards or one more generation if the GPU is working for you.

Despite still having good framerate on my 3080, I think the 10Gb is not gonna be enough sooner than later at 1440p.

I'm playing the new update in PoE2 and put my metrics on so I can see the amount of load and Vram usage. If I run into no issues and have some headroom I will keep it.

You can always free up your Windows install and remove bloat. Minimum for Win 11 is like 2-4 GB base RAM usage, so you should have enough left for gaming. Really only becomes an issue when you do stuff like open Chrome with dozens of active tabs and have like 12GB base RAM usage before even opening the game.  140€ is just a horrible price for outdated RAM. I got my 32GB kit (which is running at 3600/16 right now) for \~110€ 6 years ago.  >The 5800X3D is a beast and doesn't fall far behind the newer flagship AMD CPU's, so I'm very comfortable staying on AM4.  Well, 5800X3D is around 7600X performance in most games. Maybe slightly better whenever the 3D-cache matters. Usually, you get \~10% per gen, but just the one gen step to the 7800X3D is already 20% faster.  There certainly is no big reason to upgrade right now, but it also makes no sense to get new DDR4 RAM. Realistically, you could just sell RAM+MoBo+CPU and get like 300-400€ for it. Which you can then use to get an AM5 system with a 9600X or so. You might even be able to get a 7800X3D system if we include those 140€ that you would be willing to spend on new RAM.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.

(I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.).

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.

But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",AMD,2024-10-30 20:22:39,1

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*.

When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3

That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,kpv2g8f,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,AMD,2024-02-11 01:23:45,1
Intel,kpv5euk,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face.

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.

It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise.

If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",AMD,2023-10-30 20:36:21,14

We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.

There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur.

It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative.

There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better.

Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.

The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.

With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG.

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.

Intel,k1tamw3,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,AMD,2023-09-23 04:26:51,4
Intel,k1s8m60,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",AMD,2023-09-22 23:25:22,3

Intel,k1sl137,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",AMD,2023-09-23 00:55:30,3

Intel,k1ryjta,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,AMD,2023-09-22 22:15:11,1

It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

Intel,k1t81d2,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.

Intel,k1szqei,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update.

So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.

If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",AMD,2023-08-19 13:41:23,2
Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",AMD,2023-08-19 14:24:33,6

Intel,jwv7qel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?

Intel,jwuwjmm,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

One company's been rolling losses year after year with falling market share, one is the complete opposite, the writing was on the wall a long time ago.

Nvidia isn't exactly paying AMD even when they hold 90-95% of the market. Legislative scrutiny tends to come from manipulative practices, not from just selling a better product.

Intel,n0wq7k2,"> There are people to this day, who keeps complaining that Intel didn’t innovate back in the day and charged so much for their CPUs.   When AMD launched Zen 3 and later Zen 3 3D, they were fast but also very expensive compared to what Intel offered. Intel, AMD, Nvidia, same shit, different maker. The moment they will make a product better than the competition it will be more expensive. It's called a monopoly.    Back then when Intel charged a lot for their chips they did it because they had no competition.

Intel,n0uy3p5,">Intel needs to fix their Arc supply issue. They really need to start pumping out Arc cards on US soil.  Margins have to be way too low for Intel to do this, especially since Intel also said they would be cutting low margin product development.   They might still end up biting the bullet, but I don't think they should at all. There are tons of better areas where that money can be spent.   >I can’t give financial advice, but Intel is at a good price. if Intel can get the foundries up and running sooner, its stock will be a buy for most.  Honestly, I still think the risk is too high. No external 18A customers is a terrible, terrible sign. Intel can bear the economics of 18A internally, but they outright said that doesn't apply anymore for 14A.   >They live in this alternate reality where AMD can do no wrong, as Amd 9800 X 3-D chips melt   Tbf a pretty small scale issue, which hasn't stopped the popularity of those chips at all... unlike the RPL fiasco.",Intel,2025-07-02 00:35:01,4
Intel,n0yywsv,"Different strategies. X3D has its place in time. X3D chips have to have another separate line to build and now test. No mobile X3D chips so far.   Silicon cost is greatly lowered if the design is the same and desktop/mobile chips can be binned to create separate product lines.    AMD I will argue absolutely needed to produce stellar products because of their past history before Zen 1. No one will defend AMD products before Zen 1.   I will definitely use a newer better AMD chip today but back then he'll no. There GPU line has driver issues and its why all of us just use NVIDIA gpus. There is a good reason.    Intel's new chip design strategy and leading edge fab is solid. The problem is foundry capital expenditure and foundry capacity. They have to build excess and train excess personal. The Ohio Silicon Heart Land. A whole new campus, town, new families, and Silicon ecosystem.    That takes time and a ton of money. And investment (aka the money levers) just dont want to pay for this. They rather get there money's worth of AI and self driving vehicles today. They know Chinese EV investment is bad and Chinese AI is bad. So rather than invest in Chinese companies and not make money, they want to use there leverage to pump up American companies.    This way American companies like Tesla and AI will succeed and win this AI race.   In other words, China ain't in the leading edge foundry game. None at all. No chance. So why pump money into that? They instead are attacking the EV and AI race. So our American companies will need capital to defend that space.   Intel design products are absolutely solid. 1000% they maintain better MT performance without SMT. SMT has security vulnerability.    Intel products are wafer Silicon efficient with p and E cores. Intel design is solid. Just foundry is extremely expensive and there isnt a China competitor. Taiwan is a very safe island.   If Taiwan was like a Hawaii, easily conquered, then for sure TSMC is at risk. But Taiwan today is like an island carrier/fortress. Too difficult to go against. At least not yet.   Its only value is in its tropical fruits and strategic island location.",Intel,2025-07-02 16:46:14,2

I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

Intel,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Intel,2025-08-27 01:58:06,1

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz. That's a huge clock speed deficit compared to the 5800XT and 5800X3D. When the 5800X3D first came out, it spanked the 5800X even though it was clocked 200MHz lower all-core (4500MHz vs 4300MHz).  But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron.

Very rarely we see such leap within a single gen.    LGA 1851 was supposed to support 3 gens but became a single gen platform because Meteor Lake-S and Panther Lake-S were cancelled, perhaps for a good reason, which is the chips were very mobile focused and scaled poorly on desktop as shown by ARL-S only achieving low 5GHz and poor ring clock speed and latency.   Considering intel's current financial difficulties, I'm sure it was considered a waste of resource to design and validate desktop chips that aren't amazing on anything but power efficiency. LGA 1851 still supports 3 gens on mobile, where power efficiency matters the most.   LGA 1954 will likely support 3+ gens again, like LGA 1851, but with all the products coming to desktop.

It was often practically tied with an OCed 7700k at 4K.  The R5 line swept the floor vs the Kably Lake i5s (e.g. i5 7600k) in productivity. It also beat them in newer/more demanding games (lower frame rate scenarios). It did NOT win in older/high-frame rate esports titles.   My expectation is that in the real world (mid range CPU + mid range CPU), the R5 was generally the better gaming chip.  The R3 (4C/8T) vs i3 (2C/4T) comparison was VERY one sided and the clock speed gap was smaller than with the i7s and most i3 models couldn't be OCed if I recall correctly.   \------  This is at/near launch.

This is entirely transparent to software; it is all handled in hardware. AMD has seen a \~25% reduction in fabric bandwidth usage.  That should explain why AMD chose to stick with GDDR6, or perhaps how the 9070XT manages to compete with the 5070 Ti, despite the latter having a massive 40% raw bandwidth advantage.  Of course, the 9070XT also has 33% more SRAM (64MB vs. 48MB), so it’s not exactly a 1:1 comparison, but still… quite impressive.  In any case, I have a feeling things will really heat up on the Radeon side next generation thanks to GDDR7, N3, and the shift to a brand-new architecture (hopefully).

That only makes sense if we pretend Nvidia doesn't already have aggressive compression, which they’ve had for years. Historically, Nvidia's compression has been better than AMD's as well.  A ""\~25% fabric traffic reduction"" in gaming tests isn't a free +25% to external bandwidth, and it doesn't erase a \~40% raw GB/s gap. Even if we assume AMD just matched or let's even go as far as to say \~10% better than Nvidia's compression, they'd still be well behind on effective bandwidth.  The simpler explanation for those results is that the tested scenarios aren't that bandwidth-bound.

AMD,naxro34,"Kepler\_L2 said L0 and L1 is merged in CDNA4. Maybe RDNA 5 goes even further and merges all CU level caches (including VRF) into one big shared flexible cache like Apple did with M3 and A17 Pro.   Like you said it's about SRAM scaling being bad and minimizing SRAM investment. N3P = no scaling, N5 poor scaling vs N7.      NVIDIA definitely has the advantage here while AMD's cache system is overly complicated and inflexible. The next logical step is to make caches into one big shared block that can be dynamically allocated for different purposes.   L1 will be much more important with the new WGS and ADC scheduling and dispatch within each SE. No more global scheduling only work item preparation and load balancing. This and other methods could explain why L2 will be less important and less used allowing AMD to use 24MB L2 on AT2 (According to MLID and Kepler\_L2 rumours).   Actually the rumour for AT2 is +25% CUs and -25% PHY width vs 9070XT, so perhaps AMD has some novel and forward looking memory saving technology in UDNA. AT2 on paper could easily be stronger than 4090 in raster and that's wild with 24MB L2 and such a weak memory subsystem.

They can't allow AMD to take the PT crown. Also maybe something insane nextgen like a NeRF ASIC within the geometry pipeline. IIRC NVIDIA had a paper on this a while ago.     That's true but the interesting thing is that if you go even further back IIRC I couldn't find an RT patent that didn't get implemented in RDNA4. So at least for RT patents most of them can reasonably be expected to be implemented in RDNA5. Skeptical about the DMM patents, but everything related to DGF and prefiltering nodes is pretty much a given.  Perhaps this time it's different, we'll see but not fully convinced either. And there is still the possibility that a lot of the patents might be reserved for AMD's nextnextgen.",hardware,2025-08-29 05:52:44,1

Doubt NVIDIA can do another Fermi -> Kepler or Maxwell (not happening) moment, but perhaps they'll surprise us. I could see them pulling a Maxwell moment with PT though. The fundamental core is still Ampere which at is core is still Turing/Volta so a clean slate might happen and that could have massive ramifications similar to AMD's RDNA5/UDNA.  On AMD side let's just hope the architectural changes are massive + AMD's patent derived (unconfirmed) scheduling overhaul is forward looking like GCN Async compute.

AMD,nb1k6f3,Intel needs to pour money and manpower into finishing the Xe4 graphics IP and pulling forward it's release date  Nova Lake-A and AX will use the Xe3 graphics IP (both are expected to release sometime in 2027]  Intel needs to have Xe4 versions of both big APU products ready in 2027 or 2028   **What I think happened**  I think Exist50 was right. Xe3P based Celestial products were likely canceled after the disastrous midyear earning call in 2024  After the unexpectedly huge success of the B580/B670 Intel must've then restarted their DGPU/Large iGPU plans  That's because We're not seeing any DGPU Celestial leaks but we are seeing Nova Lake-A and AX that are supposed to ve ready in 2027  Considering Xe3 will be used in Panther Lake (Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 release) it supports my hypothesis.  **Intel's DGPU future:**  If we don't see DGPU Celestial products in 2026 then either we don't see them or Celestial will be like Battlemage and Intel will have to sell bigger dies that compete with smaller AMD and Nvidia counterparts in 2027 (likely sharing GPU silicon dies with Nova Lake-A and AX)   If they do release a Celestial DGPU then it will likely only be 1 or 2 SKU's that compete on price and are ready in 2027  It will likely be very quickly replaced with Xe4 Druid DGPU's in 2028 which should look more like a proper    AMD/Nvidia  GPU lineup.,hardware,2025-08-27 23:51:25,2

AMD,nab1e1g,"If we all want vanilla, the same flavor, the same performance, then forcing board makers to adhere to AMD's recommendations is fine.  Many enthusiasts are building pcs to tinker with them, to make adjustments to make them a little better a little different.  This is why we have options in bios to make changes.The ""p"" in pc stands for personal, we want to make it ours.  Manufacturers understand this and create products to sell into the enthusiast market to meet this need.  The manufacturers need to be mindful of the risks they take and not go to the extreme of torching cpus and mobos (a la Intel).  The manufacturers are trying to balance performance vs longevity.  In general they do a good job.  The problems with Asrock boards effected a small percentage of boards.  A significant number of boards were impacted to be sure, but still a small percentage.  The estimates I've seen are perhaps 1 to 2%.  Had it been as widespread as some think, 50%+, Asrock would have had to pull their boards immediately because that high a failure rate is unsustainable financially AND it will destroy the brand's credibility.    It is helpful to keep perspective on the magnitude of the problem and why the manufacturers are enticed to take risks.  The board makers are appealing to builders who are looking for competitive advantages.  Sometimes, the engineers fly a little too close to the sun.  This is similar to the problem Nvidia has with the 12vhpwr connectors.   There is no doubt there is a problem, yet the vast majority of 5090 cards run fine with no melting cables.  Most people with Asrock or other boards suffered no failures.  If you were someone whose board/cpu failed, it was a major problem and unacceptable.  I get that.  It is important to keep perspective.  I encourage the designers, engineers, manufacturers to push the envelope to wrest better and better performance from their designs and products.  When they do this we all benefit.  Amd occasionally, mistakes are made.  The test is how people and companies respond to the mistakes.  Will we own our mistakes, make amends, learn from the mistakes and move forward?  Or do we want to prosecute and persecute those that made the mistake?  If companies like Asrock were more forthcoming in publicly owning the mistake, then it might diffuse things.

AMD,nabcqwl,"Definitely agree. Yet it seems complicated when it comes to XMP settings to run RAM above default jedec speeds. Different minimum voltages needed for different memory vendors and specs of the kit, not just the memory voltage but the VSOC voltage for the memory controller on the CPU. A lot of the AMD cpu failures were from mobo makers juicing the VSOC too high to guarantee the memory is stable.  It’s possible to enforce it but a lot of effort needs to go into testing and verifying minimum voltages needed needed on every single board and every single memory kit. And it leads to more product RMAs when just a tiny bit more voltage is needed to make a certain kit stable but the board isn’t giving it. IMO they should be making the effort though. Could cause increased costs but that’s better than ruining reputation frying chips and getting all that bad press.  Not saying the current situation with the mobo vendors is OK, they seem pretty lazy about setting too high voltages, especially for VSOC, when XMP is on, and just calling it fine and shipping it.

However there are incredibly helpful tools and solutions for power users which are either just not presented to users, or usage of them are even presented.  A lot of chip(let) to chip(let) communication is already covered by ECC or at least EDC, and error counters are commonly available, they are just not properly (especially not uniformly) exposed.  For example on modern AMD CPUs, increasing FCLK too high can result in experiencing stuttering, making it highly likely that the IFOP is protected by some EDC. EDC error counters being exposed to users could be helpful with treating errors before they turn into crashing, and they could be also useful for faster and more reliable stability tests.  Then there's that whole ECC memory issue of reliable memory not considered being important for regular users.

Even without going into the details of hidden tech info, just consider the much simpler localization problem, users robbed of the opportunity to learn English. The degraded language skills as a result were already visible online several years ago, but I've started seeing more and more non-English posts/comments in otherwise English environments, seemingly with the expectation of others using translators (or does ""new"" Reddit automatically do it?).  Of course there are people who don't even try, but a lot of people learned not by actively seeking out knowledge, but just solving challenges on their way towards a goal. When an Apple phone user (think of all the tablet kids) isn't even allowed to know that files exist, or a gaming console user isn't allowed to run anything not related to gaming on what's essentially a locked down x86 PC, then how are they supposed to learn without even knowing what they are missing out on?  Hell, I'll go as far as claiming that curiosity about technology is even punished, and not even culturally like kids calling you a nerd. Can't even do a lot of tasks on a PC anymore because a lot of services are phone-only, and then it turns out that the phone crapp isn't willing to run on a non-stock OS. Why learn and experiment when anything else than just going with the flow gets you in trouble, and culturally we seem to be in a phase of the majority of the people being okay with everything getting dumbed down, users being expected to just consume without thinking too much?  We had a golden age of computing where people could (and had to) learn quite a bit about technology to get to their goals, and many people could do so with having to learn English first. Nowadays people are funneled towards entertainment/consuming with just a few clicks/taps, and even if anything goes wrong, the technical details are often hidden, only presenting a ""Something went wrong"" or ""Oopsie woopsie"" page.

So technically speaking, the odds of a 12vhpwr having connection issues and melting at 300w are higher than 2x8 Pin doing so.   It's a bad design at 300w, and it's a *God Awful* one above that. All they had to do was make the connector a bit bigger and this whole thing could have been avoided.   If you watched der8auer's videos on the subject, you'll note that all it takes is for one point of poor, or very poor contact to start a slow snowball affect that could take out the whole connector.

Well, because they're used to electrical devices being built to a much higher standard.  The required standards for electrical devices in Germany would normally require that if multiple wires share a load passively, either each wire needs to be fused individually, or each wire needs to be able to take the full load itself.  With 12VHPWR, that'd require AWG10 per wire, or if each wire is individually fused, AWG15. For reference, 12VHPWR uses in reality AWG16.

AMD,n9y6ly8,"Benchmarks of what? 4x PCIe 5 gives about 126 Gigabits of bandwidth. USB ports can go up to 40 Gigabit. If I look at the rear ports on my motherboard I have:  * 1x 40G * 1x 20G * 2x 10G * 2x 5G  That's 75 gigabit in total. So in theory, if you expect all those ports to be fully utilized you really do need to allocate 4x PCIe 5 lanes. Like I said before, I completely agree that it's a waste and I'd rather have those lanes be freely available, but if they think high bandwidth USB is so important then there's not really a way around this.  I'm just thankful MSI managed to make a board suitable for my setup (with that 4x slot from the chipset).

The 14600K is only $150 right now via Newegg and comes with BF6 for ""free"".  **Effectively $80 for the CPU itself assuming you were planning on buying the game at launch.**  Considering he's playing on 1440p, the FPS difference won't really be super high unless its some CPU bound esports game or ms flight sim.  This is obvious due to cache.  People might argue AM5 upgradability, but this only makes sense if you're planning on keeping a platform for like 5+ years.  Selling off the mobo and CPU every 2-3 years is more logical IMO.  The 14600K performs a little better than the current AMD 8 core single CCD's ATM for MT related stuff.  I wouldn't exactly look at this like a 6 core CPU.. It's generally competitive with a 12900K due to clock/ring speed differences, minus some MT performance being left off the table.  There's nothing wrong with AMD, but if OP is planning on buying BF6.. it's kind of a no brainer to go 14600K with a half decent board.   He should be able to net min $200\~ in the next few years when he wants to upgrade.  Power draw in most games is actually within 40W of each other when left stock... Only outlier is likely battlefield where the game will leverage a full CPU and draw like 150W max.. but it's really only this game engine.  I'll go against the grain a little..

I also love how everyone parrots ""spend more - who cares how much, because you can upgrade on the same socket and save a few dollars!"" Like bro, save the money up front instead, get a great performer now, and just upgrade when you need it. It comes out to similar cost in the end, since everything will be cheaper (ie cost / frame) in 5 years. If you need to upgrade sooner than that, you probably made compromises in your initial CPU choice, or you are an enthusiast and wouldn't be making this post.    As I prepare for the downvotes, I will add I feel good about 14600k, but not 14700k or higher.

If budget is strict, even something like a used $200 3060 Ti should beat out the RX6600.. but there may be more optimal options in that price range (I just haven't looked recently).

AMD,nahjcet,"Try to snag a 6700/6700xt with 12gb of VRAM, seriously (or whatever 7000-series card has 12gb).  That or a used version of that card on ebay (or amazon), sometimes you can even get them with warranty.  If you are open to nvidia, a 12gb 3060 Ti will work also, again a used card.  Just try to get 12gb of VRAM if possible, as what is going to hit you first and foremost is the 8gb VRAM limit issues which is a right-now current event.  However, if that price is too much for you to swing (or the price of any 12gb cards), then 8gb will have to do.  If you are targeting 1080p resolution, or 1440p on games older than a year or two (or three), you should be OK at somewhere in the neighborhood of medium to high settings, which you can lower if things get too choppy.  If it is REALLY slow, just knock texture detail down to medium first, as this helps 8gb cards a lot, and keep those ray tracing settings down to low or off.  Get a 9060 or better if you want to even try RT effects on AMD cards to any decent amount.  8gb VRAM cards will be fine for most e-sports games or Minecraft/Roblox/Kids games, though, if that's it's intended use-case.  In-fact Minecraft can nearly run on your refrigerator or toaster at this point... 20 years after it came out!   A used 7700, 7600, or 7500/7400 CPU can be had cheaply, just check if it comes with a cooler or not.  If it doesn't, you'll have to buy one.  Be careful when installing your CPU, not to bend the pins on the CPU socket, otherwise your PC motherboard will be damaged and you will be forced to fix it yourself (the manufacturer won't do it for free with mangled CPU socket pins!) or buy another - and they're NOT easy to fix.   GOOD LUCK!   Amazon/Ebay do sell used stuff and it can come with warranty, there's even replacement-cost policies you can buy when you buy hardware for usually around 10% the purchase cost per part that are sold by separate insurance companies (like Allstate and others) if the given sold-as warranty is not enough.  Most failures occur in the first 90 days aside of hard drives, which tend to increase in failure rates after the first 2\~3 years depending on manufacturers.  Fans can be like this too, so get decent ones to keep the rattles at bay and keep the noise down.   Edit: Used Radeon 6800 16gb cards are getting CHEAP!   Oh and when buying used, look at the seller ratings.  Don't buy from someone with no ratings or nearly no ratings, or someone that hasn't sold in a lot of years, or from anyone with an unrealistically low price.",buildapc,2025-08-24 22:13:15,1

They are said to have terrible warranty/support int he USA, but here in the EU (at least in hungary) they are actually probably the best in terms of warranty.  I personally have been suffering from their B550-e mobo, but that's on intel too (absolute garbage ethernet chip/driver. 2.5gbps I-225V. Had to buy a separate network card. Weirdly low publicity on the problem, apparently very niche.)  Considering you plan for longer term, I suggest trying to stretch the budget for a gpu with better cooling, especially one with PTM on the Core. Asus and MSI (and seemingly Galax, rare though) are the only nvidia partners who use PTM.  So the Asus Prime would be a great step up, both in overall cooling/noise and longevity. Won't ever have to be repaste it, which you would almost certainly have to do with a Zotac card in 5 years. Not a huge deal, but it's a peace of mind.   Don't get me wrong, the Zotac SFF is perfectly fine. But long term... if you care about noise, it's worth a bit more investment. Just a bit more though.  Or an MSI Gaming Trio, but that's probably unreasonably expensive.   So... of course it heavily depends on the price, but I would buy a card with a bit better cooler.

((bracketing this part in light of the card having to be very small.   It's weird to say it, but based on [this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFodA-N_SsI&t) the Gigabyte Eagle is probably a better choice than the Zotac SFF. Bit better cooling, bit better PCB. Windforce SFF is basically the same but without rgb.   Zotac offers a 5 year warranty, Gigabyte offers 4, if you register the product within 30 days of purchase.))  To be clear, any of these cards will be ""fine"" if you undervolt and power limit them. But even then they won't be very quiet.  **DAMN** just checked the case's compatibility. With front fans, the max. possible GPU lenght is 306mm.   The Zotac SFF, Gigabyte Windforce SFF/Eagle and Asus Prime technically fit with 304mm lenght. That's uncomfortably close imo...  The best model that comfortably fits is the MSI Inspire, but I assume it's much more expensive. Surprisingly quiet card, despite being tiny. It has MSI's good fans.   Inno3D also fits relatively well (300mm long), but its cooling is probably worse than the Inspire.

Note that the data in the linked review is using pricing data from November 2024 when it was published, so there have been some noticeable shifts.   Things are generally pretty consistent over time though. Newer, higher end chips pretty much inevitably offer substantially worse performance/$ than older/budget chips. The 9800X3D ($470) has an absolutely terrible price/performance ratio, because it's the 'top dog' and AMD can easily demand a significant premium for it - you're literally paying more than twice the $ per frame compared to something like a 9600X ($200), or even an Ultra 7 265K ($260). The 14600K can be found at $150 right now and pretty much blows everything else out of the water in terms of value.   AMD's dominance caused Intel's consumer sales to crater (in terms of CPUs sold to builders, because they're still milking tons of contracts with OEMs), so retail pricing on those parts has dropped significantly to accomodate. That $260 Ultra 7 265K launched at $395, which even then was *still* able to offer marginally better $ per frame vs the 9800X3D. At $260 it's in the same value realm as the 9600X.

AMD,nbs9i99,"> Whats funny is it's cheaper to get AM5 in the long run too as Intel already abandoned the lga 1851, meaning you have to buy a whole new motherboard for the next core ultra  It depends. Both the 265K and LGA 1851 motherboards are cheaper than similar AM5 chips/mobos. Assuming you're using a like-for-like motherboard (like, the MSI MAG B850M MORTAR and MSI MAG B860M MORTAR), a Core 7 265k system is $243.83 cheaper than a 9800X3D system. The 265k is $93.83 cheaper than the 9700x. There's maybe a little savings lost since the Intel's can (and should) be outfitted with faster member than AM5, but that should hopefully be re-usable.  The 265k is definitely not as fast as the 9800X3D in most games, but, unless tariffs completely f motherboard market, you'll be able to get a AM6 or LGA xxxx board in the future",buildapc,2025-09-01 04:39:29,-1

AMD actually also beats intel in the Threadripper segment.   The only place intel still wins is max OC Performance, from my perspective a sad development and intel made mistakes, but a lot of hate is actually over exaggerated and misleading.   Because it also leads to high AMD prices. A 7800x3D is a great CPU, but it's old and more expensive than it should be, just because of the promotion.   Intel on the other hand gets cheaper and cheaper and if intel falls too much behind we won't gain anything of it. This happened to AMD against Nvidia and we see the outcome now.

AMD,nbqhcp7,"Well thank you, but it's a bit outdated, especially since Intel got a free performance boost. We talk about ram up to 8000+ MHz and free OC tuning to gain extra percentages.  But let's assume that's no real thing because we maybe talk about 5-10% extra performance.  First there is only one game, Baldurs Gate at 1080p which is better because it utilises the CPU more, but it's not really representative overall. The second strange thing: the 14900K which is actually a very powerful CPU in gaming (not as powerful as AMDs top notch CPUs, but still very strong), and pretty close to the 7800x3D falls strangely behind, if I'm not mistaken it's sometimes even better than the 7800x3D while being much more expensive obviously.  If I search for more benchmarks in more games I get very different results, also when I check videos and comparisons.  Anyway let's assume we only have this piece of information... Then we still see the ultra series in the upper midfield or top field. The ultra 9 should have way better values nowadays but the 7 is the great value CPU and it should perform comparable to the 5700x3D which is actually a very decent performance at 1080p. What's the performance uplift here, if it is CPU demanding 10-25% based on the game? Well here comes the important point, that's a big factor. I could take multiple sources, but I found actually one of gamersnexus and if you scroll through the games, you get a better view on the ranked CPUs and in many games they perform even better.  https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-core-ultra-7-265k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-285k-245k-7800x3d-7900x-more So let's break that down, you get a CPU, that's maybe 20/25 percent worse in gaming, 75 bucks cheaper but vice versa 15-30% better in productivity while being newer and supporting faster ram and overall it's easy to cool and not massively less efficient than the 7800x3D.   And all of the gaming performance is less important if you play on 1440p or 4K anyway.   For me the intel sounds like a decent option and it's by far not a bad cpu.  Oh and who buys a 7800x3D or even 9800x3d and no GPU capable of playing 1440p or higher - maybe if you want to play super competitively.",buildapc,2025-08-31 21:50:29,1

You could sell your CPU-MBO-RAM for 160$ or so(idk really) and then when you sell it add the money to your 200$ and get a new AM5 platform for example on Newegg 7600+Gigabyte Eagle B650+32GB 6000MT DDR5 is 415$ or get a bundle on Ebay for 350$ with the same specs.

AMD,nbhd1so,"Swapping RAM is a bad idea. DDR4 is overpriced since we aren't getting any more stock. Also, you can probably just clock up your RAM manually with some trial and error (e.g. I got a 3000/15 kit and clocked it to 3600/16).  As for the GPU: An RX 9070 should be around 30% faster than a 3080 on average. For Cyberpunk specifically, the RX 9070 should even be close to 50% faster. And you'd save some money due to lower consumption on top of that (usually \~2-3ct/h gaming, which won't make a big difference at that cost, but it is something to keep in mind).",pcmasterrace,2025-08-30 12:36:16,3
AMD,nbkicu3,">My idea is to upgrade the GPU to a RX 9070XT (most important factor being 16Gb VRAM)  a RX 9070XT would be about a 40% improvement in 1440p it's in the range where you really fell the boost.  is it worth is another question, up to you to know if 650-700€ for a 40% lift is enough.  in your own exemple of recommended spec you can play at 1440p High with a 3060 Ti and DLSS balance so the 3080 a still lots of life for that resolution and I would keep it. The only reason I changed mine is because I brought a 4K screen in the mean time.  >and to swap my RAM for a DDR4-3600 CL18 (32Gb) kit.

I agree what someone else here said, that saving up for a new platform (AM5 - to also upgrade RAM from 16 to at least 32GB) would be wiser for now as I have RTX 3080 12GB and it works fairly well for 4K (obviously not ultra on everything, but generally even medium or high looks great these days + you can always use DLSS) and then maybe wait for Nvidia Super cards or one more generation if the GPU is working for you.

Despite still having good framerate on my 3080, I think the 10Gb is not gonna be enough sooner than later at 1440p.

AMD,nbhovzd,">It's about €140 for the RAM kit (Kingston Fury). Wouldn't it be a substantial upgrade going from 16Gb to 32Gb? I see a lot of games switching to 16Gb minimum and 32Gb recommended.  You can always free up your Windows install and remove bloat. Minimum for Win 11 is like 2-4 GB base RAM usage, so you should have enough left for gaming. Really only becomes an issue when you do stuff like open Chrome with dozens of active tabs and have like 12GB base RAM usage before even opening the game.  140€ is just a horrible price for outdated RAM. I got my 32GB kit (which is running at 3600/16 right now) for \~110€ 6 years ago.  >The 5800X3D is a beast and doesn't fall far behind the newer flagship AMD CPU's, so I'm very comfortable staying on AM4.  Well, 5800X3D is around 7600X performance in most games. Maybe slightly better whenever the 3D-cache matters. Usually, you get \~10% per gen, but just the one gen step to the 7800X3D is already 20% faster.  There certainly is no big reason to upgrade right now, but it also makes no sense to get new DDR4 RAM. Realistically, you could just sell RAM+MoBo+CPU and get like 300-400€ for it. Which you can then use to get an AM5 system with a 9600X or so. You might even be able to get a 7800X3D system if we include those 140€ that you would be willing to spend on new RAM.

AMD,nbg0rct,"You hurt my feelings now, made me feel old, haha. But just to give you a rough idea of ​​what it was like, Intel was 100% dominant in the processor market. Notebooks, Macbooks, premade desktops—they all typically came with an Intel processor; coming with an AMD processor was practically synonymous with low quality. It was also common for an entry-level processor to be the Intel Core i3 (which is still weak today). With the arrival of the AM3+ (Bulldozer architecture), AMD began to gain more acceptance among gamers because they were very cheap compared to Intel and compensated for the lack of ""polish"" with brute force, making performance very similar. But despite this, they had heating issues, which bothered a lot of people. Still with this architecture, AMD launched the A-Series, which was a very cool APU (basically a Ryzen G prototype) that increased the presence of AMD chips in notebooks. Then with AM4 AMD overtook Intel in desktops, and years later, Apple launched the M1, also leaving Intel behind. Now they basically only dominate the notebook sector (and I imagine the server sector).",pcmasterrace,2025-08-30 05:23:38,1

The industry should come together and agree on some kind of standard.. maybe base it on tier.year.placement.specifics so basically the same except the generation would be the year it was released so ""i5 25700k""  Maybe to give some distinction between GPU and CPU and APU and NPU start with the letter C For classic CPU and then A for apu/iGPU N for NPU and G for GPU  So.. Intel Ci5 25700K? They would have to use something new   AMD CR5 25700X   GPU GRU the R for Radeon and the U for UDNA 25700xt.

A Ryzen 7 250, is the exact same chip as the 8840HS with the new name and that CPU was also a refresh of the 7840HS, just with a NPU added.   They changed for that, only because Intel got the Core 100 naming for their ""AI ready SoC"" and 200 is more than 100.

We'll probably be stuck on 3nm into 2030 or longer.  Nodes bring faster chips and it'll be easier to run PT on them.  When consumer switches to 2nm, we'll see another large boost, not again that will likely be 2030+.  Servers and AI GPU will get 2nm first.  Followed by 1.8nm (which is a revision of 2nm).

It was insanely bad during COVID, and the current global trade situation is probably not going to help in the long run.  My secondary problem with this is that I always thought the Wraith Prism was super cool with some of the best lighting effects I've ever seen, a good cooler design for its small package... it would have been cool to see AMD/CoolerMaster to develop it a little more.

AMD added tessellation with unified shaders in 2007, the first approach was certainly acceptable for that time. The 7870 and 7970 had something like 4x the tessellation performance of an HD 2900 XT, the improvement was pitiful, and it was by no means a priority for ATI/AMD at the time.  It certainly fit the narrative of AMD fanboys at the time to call out Nvidia for ""gimping performance through excessive tessellation"" though.

Nvidia didn't go in and quadruple the tessellation factor of the water in Crysis 2 and they didn't force the devs to make hair obscenely tessellated in Witcher 3. Nvidia gave the devs early access to new GPUs and their new SDKs. These games were both on pretty harsh dev cycles and were targeting both maxed out PC's and much weaker consoles. Optimization is the first thing to be cut in favor of an earlier release date, and what we got was horrible scaling on ATI/AMD cards.  Doing things like lowering the tessellation of hairworks and limiting tessellation factors on the driver level for ATI didn't actually solve the problem but rather masked the issue of weak tessellation on ATI/AMD cards of the time. Hairworks looked worse with lower tess factors, but was worth the performance gain.

But if those developers are all using Nvidia cards, and they can get away with insane amounts of tesselation and don't have the time to target other hardware, you'll get lopsided performance scaling.

In this case, forcing that many passes pedantically just to out-perform the competition is a blatant anti-competitive practice, period. It's not like RT/PT where AMD is at a clear disadvantage of their own making, because these technologies do make a tangible difference.  While Nvidia never ""forced"" devs to implement Hairworks, it's obvious there was bribery at work because quite often alternative technologies were straight up missing.

They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there.

Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed.

And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up).

AMD,n0ap7lk,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

AMD,n046z2m,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

AMD,navgo8f,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification. For anyone building new systems, Intel recommends using RST instead of VROC, but existing X299 users can continue using VROC with supported drives from the qualified vendor list. ***Support is now limited to sustaining mode with no new features or drive certifications planned, as confirmed in the support article you referenced.***",Intel,2025-08-27 01:43:49,1

The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period.

AMD,mte086a,">Faster DDR5 DRAM chips are coming, even at high capacities, but existing DIMM standard is a bottleneck due to signal degradation.   Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work.
