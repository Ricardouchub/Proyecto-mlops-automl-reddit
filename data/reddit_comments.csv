Intel,nzdnidn,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",hardware,2026-01-13 16:43:04,7

Intel,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",hardware,2026-01-13 15:59:39,1

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work.

Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",hardware,2026-01-07 12:05:46,2

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",hardware,2026-01-08 08:30:40,1

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:41:27,-2

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.

Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.

If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power.

E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Though, it's kind of ironic, how Intel all by itself proved themselves liars, when it took them basically +6 years since 2017, for eventually coming up with only a mere chiplet-copycat and their first true disintegrated chiplet-esque design …  For a design, which *in their world-view*, Intel was working on their tiles-approach already since a decade, which is at least what they basically claimed when revealed by 2018 – I called that bullsh!t the moment I first heard it. Surprise, surprise, they again straight-up *lied* about it …  They most definitely did NOT have had worked on anything chiplets/tiles before, if it took them *this* long.  Just goes to show how arrogant Intel was back then, letting AMD cooking their Zen in complete silence since 2012/2013, for their later Ryzen. *Still boggles my mind, how Intel could let that happen* …  > Yes, they also benefitted a lot from both having an actually decent node and on-package memory […]  In any case, we can't really deny the fact, that Intel basically cheated on Lunar Lake using OpM, eventually creating a halo-product, which ironically was quite sought after, but yet expensive asf to manufacture.  If AMD would've been to cheat like that (using OpM) in a mobile SKU, while dealing some marked cards in such a underhanded manner, it would've been ROFL-stomped Lunar Lake …",hardware,2025-11-06 20:39:31,-2

There are very few games where 1440p simply won't run on 8 GB of RAM. With the RAM crisis only going to get worse, my hope is that developers will put a little bit of effort into optimizing vRAM usage.

This isn't a future issue, this is a now issue. It currently does not have enough vram for 1440p gaming in nearly any new heavy titles, including battlefield 6 (just as a recent example).   Hell, at 1080p my 8gb card was over capacity on battlefield 6. There's an argument to be made that it isn't enough for future 1080p gaming as well.  Can you do plenty of gaming on an 8gb card? Yes. Can you run every game at max settings? No, not even on 1080p. You'll have to turn settings down. Which frankly I'm in the boat of ""not usually a big deal"", but it's not good when you pay 300+ bucks for a new piece of hardware that can't run your games at full tilt.   It is more powerful than the B580, yes. The B580 will last longer because of VRAM, also yes.   My suggestion is really think about how long it will be until your next upgrade and make your decision based upon that. Longevity, go with intel. More power now for just a couple of years (2 or 3), consider the 9060XT/5060 (at 1080p only, skip entirely for 1440p). Or look at their 16gb variants.   You could also look at used options.

Intel,nwn5ndl,"So recently I bought a new prebuilt that came with a 5060 TI 8GB. For my old system, shortly before, I'd purchased a 9060 XT 16GB.  I haven't had an AMD card in many a year, and I was inclined to be generous to NVIDIA, thinking ""Hey, they've got DLSS, they've got multi-frame gen, yadda yadda yadda...""  So I'd been playing Borderlands 4 on my old rig with the 9060 XT when the 5060 TI system came in a few days ago. I tried playing Borderlands 4 on the new PC with DDR5 RAM and a much better processor, and for every game I tried (Witchfire, Borderlands 4), it was a much worse experience.  DLSS frame gen treated me well on my old 4060 so I thought  multi-frame gen would be rad and close the 8GB-16GB gap, but holy shit the lag was like improperly configured Lossless Scaling. It was awful, and I am NOT generally sensitive to latency. I really learned that without enough native frames to feed frame gen, it's not even a feature worth using.  I suspect had my new PC had the 16gb version of the 5060 TI it probably would have run everything as well as, if not better than, the 9060 XT.  As an example, on my new PC with the 5060 TI, Borderlands 4 was running like less than between 35-50 fps native on medium settings. With the same processor, same RAM, but a 9060 XT 16GB, it runs natively in the 70s and 80s on high settings.  Now, I do only game at 1080p, mind you, so that factors in as well, I suppose.  I was a true believer that 8GB was still enough in late 2025, especially with AI assistance, until this past weekend. I would urge you to go with more VRAM. I know, personally, I'll never buy another GPU with 8GB VRAM again after I see how impactful it is.",buildapc,2025-12-30 00:27:21,1
Intel,nwn9c6w,"The whole vram issue is valid. But, ultimately, all you can do is look at the games you want to play. For the vast majority of current games, the 9060xt performs better and not by a tiny amount.

Intel,nyzgjj6,"I'm currently researching the exact same thing, except I have a 1440p monitor so am targetting that. Price difference is about the same, too - can get B580 for AUD 400 vs RX 9060 at AUD 480 (though it's a MAXUN brand which I have mixed feelings about, and the Intel is an original Intel ""brand"" and looks beautiful). I'd like to point out two main considerations that I haven't seen others mention:      1. Upscaling quality and performance. As these are low-end cards, we will almost certainly have to use upscaling to get any decent performance for modern games (when you move to 1440p or even if you want to have higher qualities/details at 1080p, depending on your tastes), and XeSS seems superior to FSR. XeSS does work on other cards, but is hardware-accelerated on Intel cards and is apparently almost as good as DLSS. And for games that have upscaling but not XeSS, we can use OptiScaler to replace FSR or DLSS with injected XeSS.       2. Intel cards apparently have hit-or-miss compatibility/performance for older, non-DX12 games, since the hardware wasn't designed to natively support older API's and relies on a translation layer in the drivers. It is being improved over time with driver updates, though, and we also have the option of injecting DXVK (third-party DirectX to Vulkan layer) into games as another option. DXVK is used by the Steam Deck and other Linux gaming, so it should have some pretty decent coverage.  With all this said, even though I do play older games and want to keep that option open, I'm still leaning towards the B580. It still sounds like a solid upgrade over my aging RTX 2060.",buildapc,2026-01-11 15:28:44,1

Still, I'm leaning towards the Intel card, since I can find it for $80 AUD less and XeSS is apparently better than FSR (and we have OptiScaler for games that have upscaling but don't specifically support XeSS). EDIT: Well, XeSS will work on AMD cards too, but apparently it has better quality on Intel cards - I'm yet to look into the facts here.

Like the one on this image where you have to toally disassemble the cooler, remove the fan, then now have access to the heatsink fins.  ![img](r74g010585dg1)  make sure you are using the right thermal paste for direct die/laptop applications, those pastes that are viscous, good conductivity and not prone from pumping-out or deterioration when exposed from high concentrated heat.  like for CPU+GPU:  * the best will be Phase Change Thermal Interface Materials (PCTIMs) like: Thermal Grizzly PhaseSheet, or Thermalright Heilos. These provide excellent conductivity and long-term stability, making them ideal for bare-die and high-performance applications. (also not electrically conductive so safer than liquid metal and often the go to for the best). * If these aren’t available, go with thick, viscous thermal pastes that resist pump-out and handle repeated thermal cycling well. Good alternatives I’ve tested include Kold-01, Maxtor CTG10, DOWSIL TC-5888, Maxtor CTG8, Arctic MX-6 Rev.4 (2025 batch), Arctic MX7, Thermal Grizzly Duronaut and Cooler Master MasterGel Maker. These perform much better over time compared to less reliable compounds such as the Arctic MX-4, MX-5, MX-6 (2023/2024 batches), which are prone to displacement, or Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut, which tends to degrade under sustained high heat.  and if your laptop use thermal putty, you could reuse them as long as they are clean and malleable (same if they are pads). But do not replace thermal putty with thermal paste or thermal pads, as that's no good.

Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",AMD,2026-01-01 22:29:53,2

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears.

Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.  [afterburner -200mhz](https://i.ibb.co/YTQfGJtc/11111.png)  All of the crashing behavior so far is replicable in COD, CS2, Cronos New Dawn.  u/AMD_Vik",AMD,2025-12-21 02:43:00,3

It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch.

Intel,nooyj1v,"I have a dual PC setup, one system with a 9070xt where I have seen this bsod related issue, mostly when toggling HDR.  The other system has exclusivly an RTX 3090 that also has the same HDMI 2.1 related system bsod, but Nvidia driver instead.   It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,noooxx5,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.

[Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",AMD,2025-11-14 05:48:36,2

I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",AMD,2024-08-02 03:44:51,1
Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Intel,kxodaii,"Let me tell you some stuff regarding how a GPU works.   Raster performance can only take you so far.   We are in the brink of not being able to add more transistors to the GPU.   Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.   Im damn sure (and I did this before with people at my home) that if I provide you with a game blind testing it with DLSS and Frame Gen, along with other games with those features on and off, you wont be able to notice at all.",AMD,2024-04-02 10:10:50,5

No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2

And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility).

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.

Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"".

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate.

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one.

The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.

AMD,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work.

[Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant.

AMD,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",hardware,2026-01-08 08:30:40,1

These are super convenient for such cases, especially with office work where they take way more abuse as they remove the fragile screen + hinge on laptops if they're gonna be used in a situation where nobody cares about them.  My main concern is the keyboard. In office, keyboard and mouse are replaced all the time, so having one tied to the rest of the hardware is problematic. Companies often favour buying the cheapest en-masse and replace when broken, as hiring someone to fix expensive stuff that nobody cares about is not cost efficient. Yes you can just plug a new keyboard in, but I do have a bit of e-waste concern if some companies simply decide to throw them out due to speed/efficiency, kinda like how mostly fine laptops that have some broken bits are sadly discarded all the time by companies.

Notice how AMD basically doesn't allow for a slower speed variant with the same cores anymore on the high end like they used to? If you want a 9950X or 9950X3D you have to buy it. Only lower end SKUs like the 9600X will ever see a 9600 or 9500X with similar specs other than clock speeds. AMD might do a refresh of say the 5950X and make a '5950XT' but that's basically just a new stepping and it releases pretty much late into the lifecycle where it makes no sense to wait for it.

In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.

AMD,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",hardware,2026-01-13 15:59:39,-1

So far RDNA4 only has 2 die configs, 64 and 32cu. The 32cu config is exactly just 1/2 of the symmetrical 64cu config. And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces.  My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them... Just like every new GPU uArch family does for them. TeraScale, GCN, RDNA1.

Most APUs/mobiles will only run a more modern gen starting in mid 2028, if they can even ramp enough beside some Halo SKUs, dGPU and consoles (not even counting AI-GPUs). with the current lack of FSR4 for RDNA 3.5, that's dissappointing, tho they think about backporting.  dual stacked V-cache (each CCD with 2 V-cache layers) and better memory controller/IOD would've been awesome as well.   rumours and leaks obviously had nothing on the radar, so it's not suprising nothing came from CES, but still, Lisa booked a keynote - and brought basically nothing. at last years CES they delayed RDNA4 - so it's the second disappointing keynote in a row.",hardware,2026-01-12 02:59:42,1

AMD,nzbsu1l,"The difference is AMD’s mobile GPU’s have stagnated.   They haven’t had a noticeable improvement since their first RDNA 3 based iGPU’s in like 2023. Strix Point uses RDNA “3.5” which is shockingly poor in terms of gains from the RDNA 3 iGPU’s which launched in 2023.   Just for context, Intel’s Lunar Lake iGPU’s were Xe2 and [were beating Strix Point last year.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Lunar-Lake-iGPU-analysis-Arc-Graphics-140V-is-faster-and-more-efficient-than-Radeon-890M.894167.0.html)  I get it sounds “controversial” to some people in here, who see the success of AMD in handhelds and such, but again, most of those handhelds were made back when these RDNA 3 based iGPU’s launched. The Z1 was RDNA 3 and is used in most handhelds because, at the time in 2023, it was the best option available.  They’ve sat twiddling their thumbs after securing one win in 2023 that everyone else has caught up or surpassed them in mobile GPU efficiency and performance per watt.  Strix Halo has the same issue, the only difference they’ve done is increased memory bandwidth and increased the power. So in terms of perf/watt it’s still bad despite the fact that it is a good performing GPU.   “RDNA 3.5” is nonsense. AMD seemingly can’t seem to make a better iGPU with any measurable performance/watt improvements than what they did in 2023.  They’ve improved their CPU performance, with Zen 5 based processors, but again just disappointing iGPU improvements.",hardware,2026-01-13 09:57:24,1

Even cut down as far as to put into some rare 3060ti cards. They could have easily been the 10GB RTX 3070ti SUPER. It's like it's a die they made, and then regretted it, and tried to make it disappear. Even the 3060 had room for more enabled SMs. It really feels like they just cancelled that while series as well because the crypto and COVID boom was already enough, so no need to put in more effort.",hardware,2026-01-09 16:18:18,5
AMD,nym579a,"nvidias super series is just a refresh. There are a couple reasons to do refreshes for a manufacturer:   1. You typically get better chips over time. At the beginning you typically don't exactly how yields and binning will be, after some time you can typically sell higher binned products because you know how it'll work out. Even if it's a few percent, it's a small improvement for hardly any cost. Especially when the next generation is far in the future.  2. Price drops. The vast majority of cost appears in development, not per unit cost. After selling enough units and your rnd is paid for you're pretty much only making profits and can easily drop prices. It's typically better to introduce a new, cheaper product than just lowering prices in the market.      The RTX 5090 likely wouldn't get a refresh, why? It would only threaten their compute cards.    The RTX 5080 is already using the full GB203 die.    The 5070ti is already super close to the 5080.    The 5060ti is already using the full die.   A refresh would only make sense for the 5070ti (essentially sell the current 5080 as a 5070ti super), 5070 and 5060 unless they want the same performance with more vram.    We don't know how far away the next generation is.    Blackwell was never a good candidate for a refresh, never really made much sense.",hardware,2026-01-09 15:52:46,1

There wont be any huge uplift in performance this time around because of the need to hit a price point that wont make people scream.  PS5 Pro already shows how little they're able to improve over time compared to what the PS4 Pro offered in a similar time frame(and without a huge increase in price...).  And not only will the PS6 specs not be that amazing, but we're bound to have another like three years of cross-gen titles as well.  So even people with something well less than a 5080 will likely still be capable of playing the latest games decently enough for a good while.  I think a 5080 will probably be very in line with what PS6 offers in general, really.  Bit sad, honestly.

I suppose in some ways yes, but then as you play it, it’s as if something got stuck in your eye. The image isn’t stable, you shut off a flashlight and wait a moment for Lumen to catch up and make all the light particles disappear rather than it be an instant lights off. Same thing as in MGS Delta, a better apples to apples comparison, it looks good in a still image but when you move around and look at the foliage or off in the distance you see the specs flashing about and the blur/ai fighting with itself. These things are all noticeable and there are communities of people coming about because it’s almost a complete disappointment to find out a game you are interested in is releasing on UE5.  I think my point stands, MGSV looked better native, compare its native image to MGS delta on a native setting.

Very respectable showing. Though, I really wished Intel had updated their ML upscaler since there only have been incremental updates with XeSS 2, and so far is only on par with DLSS CNN, where FSR4 (and INT8) and DLSS4/.5 are superior. Don't get me wrong, XeSS3 and it's ML M/FG is great and I reckon has no frame pacing/jitter issues compared to Redstone FG, but this was a small miss from them.

Halo has an absolutely massive GPU die and barely performs better at this wattage while PTL is around the same size as Strix, and such a difference in die size affects product costs and company margins.Halo is only in a few products, and that list shrinks significantly when you're looking for a thin small laptop or handheld. Since most people will use upscaling, Xess2>FSR3 (FSR4 not supported), so image quality and stabilization will be worse on Halo. Don't get me wrong Halo is still good and still shines in its own way, but it doesn't actually win against PTL imo unless you only look at FPS and ignore every other factor.  As for the 3050 and 6600 (desktop) comparisons. Lets just say it's +-10% depending on the game and settings. With such close performance it essentially shows that lower end mobile dGPUs are about to become a relic.

AMD,nzawpjk,"As someone who threw a 4070 Ti Super at a 3600 and used it for a year, I'd throw in a beefy GPU like a 9070XT, 9060XT 16GB, or 5060 Ti 16GB at it *while accepting there are some newer releases out there and future releases that it will struggle with.* It may work for some people, it may not work for others. A minimum, I think it's something that everyone who is budget restricted should give a shot; especially if you're more of a patient gamer. For me, a 5700XT to a 4070 Ti Super felt like a brand new computer that didn't really need anything else.   In my case, I never actually naturally encountered a title that my 3600 couldn't run that I really wanted to play. Sure I saw some in benchmarks showing that some titles experienced sub-70FPS, but seeing it is different than actually encountering it in my natural course of gaming. Plus.. it's pretty much the same as seeing a title on PS5 or Switch that interests me, but I'll probably never play because I don't have a PS5 or Switch.  Sure some titles would also perform better than my 3600 could when paired with a 4070 Ti Super, but for the most part 90FPS or higher feels fine to me and I only have a 144hz 1440p monitor that I can't really tell the difference at between 110FPS and 144FPS. DLSS feels perfect fine and really carries the 3600 pretty far.   In all honesty, Hell Let Loose was the only title that I ever really naturally encountered that made the 3600 feel a bit tired, but by all means it was playable.   I did eventually move on to first a 5600 and then a 7600x, but that was more of a no-brainer financial decision. I found super good prices on both when prices were good ($110 on the CPU/mobo/RAM side of things after selling my old mobo/RAM/CPU). In all honesty, I couldn't personally say I've naturally encountered any game-changing improvements with either the 5600 or 7600x. Again, there definitely are some out there. Especially BF6. But you can stretch a 3600 extremely far and get great results (until you run into something that you flat out can't that's under 60FPS).   I've since played a couple games that my 3600 probably would have struggled with, but in all honesty they were titles I thought were overrated and could have lived without and that was my experience playing them. Had I upgraded from a 3600 to 7600x with the current prices and knew better, I'd probably have pretty bad buyers remorse.",buildapc,2026-01-13 05:13:33,1

In most games, performance should be the close to the same across all of the 5000 series.  There is nothing wrong with the 5700X3D and its a great chip, its just hard to justify at the price its currently available at.

AMD,nz84u4n,"I see. I have a similar problem with my PC in that most of the time, it runs cool, below any threshold that I worry about.  I know that my CPU isn't supposed to hit its performance limit until it reaches 100 degrees Celcius. Most of the time, it doesn't get above 60 C, even in gaming. Except when I play my currently most demanding game for my system - Oblivion Remastered.  In Oblivion Remastered, if I tried to play it with all the settings at maximum, the CPU temps would get really close to 100 C and I would see weird glitches in the game and stuttering at times.  I quit playing it for a while, but then I read somewhere that if you turn the game visual settings down a tick below max on each one except the ones for hair and the one that makes moving things like cloth and such look more realistic - those you turn way down - it will make a big difference. It sure did. Now, the game doesn't heat my system up beyond 80 C and then only for a brief time.  I'm running the game with a 2060 Super, so I'm trying to use the ray tracing effects in the game, but it's a pretty demanding thing for my setup to do, especially with hair and cloth modeling turned on max.  In terms of the processors you are asking about, the Core i9-14900K and the Ryzen 9 are quite comparable in terms of specs. i9 has more of some things and Ryzen 9 has more of other things, but the net result is so close that I don't think it justifies a CPU swap in terms of performance. In terms of heat production, the i9 is a little bit cooler and uses a little less power than the Ryzen 9.  I have noticed that trend myself over the years. Every time I upgraded to a signifcantly more powerful CPU, I had to make other changes to deal with the computer getting hotter.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-12 20:23:52,1

AMD,nxru9l1,Oh wow.  You're going to upset a lot of Intel fan-bois by stating fact that AMD64 destroyed Intel's Itanium CPUs.  Here's the back story as told by the guy that created Task Manager.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyX8TO3awfw,pcmasterrace,2026-01-05 06:07:24,22
AMD,nxry1mg,Itanium had lackluster performance for its own native software as well!,pcmasterrace,2026-01-05 06:38:16,4
AMD,nxs3ims,"The Greatest Generation had a word for what IA64 became, a ""boondoggle"". It's where something shifts and drifts so far from its original intention, becoming so complex and expensive along the way, that it no longer fulfills any of it.  What Intel wanted and what HP wanted were well aligned. HP wanted a server/high-performance computing (HPC) product to replace the older PA-RISC, while Intel wanted a monopolised line of products it could name its price on.  Itanium essentially killed every other RISC architecture of the 1990s. MIPS was sold off by Silicon Graphics, and Compaq (owners of DEC) ended work on the Alpha, both intending their future HPC machines to be IA-64. Of the RISC workstation platforms of the 1990s, only SPARC remained in development, by Sun Microsystems (soon to be gobbled by Oracle).  The point behind IA64's ""EPIC"" (explicitly parallel instruction set computer) architecture was to move almost all the CPU's instruction handling front end into software, let the compiler handle it all once then it didn't have to be done every time the code ran. So the instruction stream had to already have all its parallelism worked out, the compiler needed intimate details of the CPU's architecture.  By the time Merced actually shipped, Intel was de-hyping it in every presentation. The narrative became ""Wait for McKinley, though buy Merced now if you want to get familiarity with IA-64"". Merced had become so large on silicon that Intel's 180 nm process couldn't actually manufacture it so it starte being cut back. IA32 hardware support was first to go, but then the caches got trimmed, the exact same problem AMD was to later have with Bulldozer - and the exact same outcome.  On natively compiled IA-64 bit code against natively compiled IA-32 code a piddly little AMD K6-III from three or four years earlier at just 450 MHz was up to twice as fast as Merced running at 800 MHz. In other tests, Merced was four times faster than AMD's market-leading Athlon.  Well, anyway, we're getting a bit long and you're getting a bit bored. McKinley, the version Intel had wanted to make, fixed most of this and really was a HPC floating point monster. McKinley went more or less unchanged to 130 and 90 nm as Madison, which was dual-core and had larger L2 caches.  The future was actually looking bright for Itanium in 2001, even after Intel had cut its revenue forecast for Itanium from $35 billion in 2002 (1999 projection) to $7 billion by 2005 (2001 projection). Actual sales figures, by 2005, were barely over $2 billion.  Three things conspired against it.  1. If you wanted Itanium, you went to Intel, and Intel's pricing was catastrophic. You could buy a quad-socket Xeon system for the price of a dual-socket Itanium, and the Xeons would be faster. 2. Intel had not invited AMD to the Itanium party, when IA64 took over the world, as Intel felt was its entitlement, it would be an Intel monopoly. AMD disagreed here, so AMD extended IA-32 into AMD64, a drop-in replacement for existing systems in almost all cases. In AMD's K8-sporting Opteron's first year, it out-sold Itanium four to one: Michael Dell canned his exclusivity agreement with Intel and started selling Opteron servers. Dell wanted to sell servers, after all. 3. Very much unwilling to have Intel in control of the destiny of Windows, Bill Gates went on stage and told the world that WindowsXP's future updates would support one 64-bit architecture, and it was AMD's. Intel's share price was down over 5% by the time Gates had done speaking!  Microsoft did make a version of the NT6 codebase for IA64, but never a client version, only ever Server 2008 (NT6.0) and Server 2008R2 (NT6.1)  Itanium did lumber on, with the basic Madison architecture being more or less unchanged as it shrank to new processes, gained more cores, etc. The last Itanium, the 9700-family, was ""Kittson"" in 2017. The highest model ran at 2.66 GHz and had 8 cores. Intel's top end Xeon of 2017, based on Skylake-SP, had up to 28 cores.  The final shipping system was the HPE Integrity server/HPC, which stopped accepting IA-64 orders in 2021 and, since 2015, had been the only shipping IA-64 product. Linux removed IA-64 from mainline kernel support in 2021, Linus Torvalds quipping:  *""HPE no longer accepts orders for new Itanium hardware, and Intel stopped accepting orders a year ago. While Intel is still officially shipping chips until July 29, 2021, it's unlikely that any such orders actually exist. It's dead, Jim.""*",pcmasterrace,2026-01-05 07:25:14,6

Your render time is wholly GPU driven in Davinci. Most of the actions done on the timeline and in color grading are also wholly GPU driven. The chip won’t save 4% of your time unless those specific actions are all you’re doing for some reason.  If you’re spending a lot of time in Unreal on tasks like shader compilations? Sure, that’s gonna save time and arguments could be made for it. Particularly since that line of work also often ends up running said unreal project, which itself benefits from the chip.  “don’t find the additional gaming performance worth the price increase over the 9950X and 9900X” is a literal quote from the article right after saying they can’t recommend the chips for every workflow, among a couple others, as a reason not to spend the extra money and the article is assuming MSRP that only puts them 50 apart.  Edit: 4% is within Pugent’s margin of error, as an aside.  Edit2: since people get territorial over this kind of stuff sometimes. I *have* an x3d chip.

Games render using one GPU or the other, not both. So why access an inactive GPU's VRAM data?

AMD,nyti1nf,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".  It's only a question of how large the mapped address area is, and where in VRAM it's pointing at any given moment.",AMD,2026-01-10 17:33:52,2

The majority of them will however perform near identically. Games are typically “Low IPC” workloads. Not much stuff being done, but it needs to react to things fast.  But productivity software is “High IPC” and the optimization targets in the software and even the compilers simply aren’t designing for CPUs that have this much L3 cache.   They know what a normal CPUs latencies are, and ensure their software is always able to keep the average CPU engine fully fed never waiting for data.

Rumors exist future architectures may package the CCDs closer together to mitigate the latency. Plus we are getting more cores per CCD.",AMD,2026-01-08 04:55:33,8
AMD,nydqrhk,"Yes. This is only a problem because people talk as if X3D is black magic. It just extra L3 cache. The vertically stacked ""3D"" part is just how they're able to squeeze that more cache onto the die.  L3 cache is orders of magnitude faster than even RAM, so any time the CPU can get the data it needs from cache instead of even having to go out to RAM, you get better performance. This applies to everything a CPU does, as well, not just gaming. Gaming simply benefits greatly because, as a workload, it tends to use a lot of the same data over and over again, which means you get a lot of cache hits. A bigger cache means more data can be stored and, the chance of a cache hit versus a miss is greater, as a result. That's it. The entire secret sauce to X3D.  The reason already that the second CCD is disabled is because of the two pools of cache are separate. If a thread on CCD0 requests data, it's added to the the cache on CCD0. If a thread on CCD1 requests the same data, that's not in *its* cache, so you either call it a miss and move on or cross over the fabric to check the cache on CCD0. That instantly slows it down, though, to the point where you might as well have pulled it fresh from memory. Therefore, the way to extract the most performance is to make sure all the threads that are accessing the same cached data are using the same pool of cache, and the way you do that on a multi CCD design is to disable the other CCD.  Adding more cache to the second CCD doesn't solve this problem. The existing cache on the second CCD could already be utilized, if it made any sense to, and all that mattered was more cache overall. It just makes it so that any thread, regardless of which CCD it's on, has access to a large pool of cache. But, you would still want to confine the work for a single application entirely to one CCD to extract the most benefit. It doesn't help gaming at all. It could have some limited productivity benefits.",AMD,2026-01-08 11:39:19,7

At 5ghz there is only enough time for the signal to travel about 3-4 centimeters before the next cycle begins. You need things to be physical close, or you have to wait cycles in between requests. The more area you add, the more cycles you need to wait.  Just think about it logically, take the supposition to the extreme; imagine an infinite cache, the latency would be infinite.  -----  In this case its not adding more cache to the same ccd, but to the other ccd that lacks it. There wont be any additional latency concerns, so it should be a net positive. However, for anything that sits on one ccd, its not going to help at all. On ryzen, each ccd can only write to its own caches. One ccd can not go and write to the other ccd. It can however snoop the cache of the other ccd(and it must to ensure memory coherency), but this adds cross talk over the infinity fabric. Too much cross talk can likewise hurt performance instead of help. Again i dont think this will be an issue in this case. Its just there is such a thing as too much cache.",AMD,2026-01-08 19:33:04,0

AMD,nye82al,"You still won't want game threads crossing CCDs. The SerDes interconnect is still not fast enough, nor does it offer enough throughput for cache-cache transfers (and doesn't have this capability). All data will hit system memory if it needs to traverse another CCD. This is a significant latency hit vs V-cache, at least for first transfers. After that, data should be in both CCDs' caches, but there's not really a good way to control workloads with dependencies without locking to a single CCD. Otherwise, threads on both CCDs will stall as they wait for data from one another, traversing system memory, as all cached data is present in RAM.  Parallel ops with independent workloads can task both CCDs without much issue.  EDIT: There might be a way to optimize traffic in software, if it's intelligent and catches op dependencies from traversing CCDs. But, as usual, this has overhead and can still allow some edge cases to cross. Better to have some type of data traffic QoS than nothing though or we're back to parking the other CCD, which seems wasteful to me. Background tasks should operate on the secondary CCD at minimum.

Fanout/sea-of-wires can certainly move in this direction, but honestly, an expensive active interposer or active bridge die might be the only way to get more benefits. A lot of hardware logic is actually needed to bridge CCDs, so maybe AMD doesn't feel it's worth the transistor cost, as each design has strict transistor budgets. Those budgets are often used to further compute performance.  A full 16-core CCD is likely what will be needed without all of the expensive silicon.

They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,nxtzro3,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Intel,2026-01-05 21:06:54,3

Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future. Honestly, I hope I'm wrong.",Intel,2026-01-05 18:49:13,2

It's a different game when companies have to worry about that side, far too many consumers make decisions based on their politics when all that does is cause other issues. Obviously I won't go farther than that in a tech focused discussion lol, but I will say again that it's a different game and I don't think anyone wins if it becomes the norm.""  I'm going to add, light heartedly, I do hope we see AMD/nVidia/Qualcomm/etc manufactured and final packaged products coming out of Intel Foundries one day.

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Intel,2025-09-26 15:54:51,39

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.

But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

AMD,nqoo97z,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.

AMD,nvbb6wv,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.

The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1

AMD,nqry4gw,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Intel,2025-11-25 21:43:16,1

AMD,nt12wk5,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

That error code you're seeing (0x00020001) is actually what's called a ""hypervisor error,"" which basically means it's a problem with Windows' virtualization stuff rather than directly being caused by your WiFi drivers.  The real culprits are more likely things like memory issues, BIOS problems, or conflicts with virtualization features like Hyper-V. I'd suggest running a memory test first (just search for ""Windows Memory Diagnostic"" in your start menu), and if you have any virtual machines or Docker running, try shutting those down temporarily, we'll probably need to dig deeper into hardware or system-level issues to really fix this one.",Intel,2025-12-14 12:43:17,1
AMD,ntz1is6,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Intel,2025-12-14 13:04:59,1

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Intel,2025-09-22 14:30:36,-1

Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Intel,2025-09-24 01:35:50,0
AMD,ngcdph8,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.
