A full on physical core is better than a virtual core, but the same amount of cores with multi-threading is much better than just a same core-count CPU without it. Intel are offering up to 16 cores which is 16 cores/16 threads, but generally should offer better multi-core performance vs an 8-core 16-thread. If anything it’s nice Intel have the ability to improve core count offerings without significantly raising the power requirements.

Intel,nngofbt,"> […] It doesn't seem like it improved on N3 and I know that they were targeting better frequency and lower power than they got.  Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:40:28,-1
Intel,nnitrfm,"Jaykihn, whose tweets these leaks are based on, says that the design characteristics cannot be extrapolated to the node itself.   So it is less likely that the clocks are limited by 18A. It is just what was decided for this particular product.",hardware,2025-11-07 01:28:24,0
Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:17:12,-5

Intel,nngrg35,It makes sense to have three as the low-power cores prioritize keeping the power consumption low for battery life but to achieve this they aren't attached to the ring bus which hurts performance so 8 regular E cores are also used,hardware,2025-11-06 18:54:32,10
Intel,nnhqy1t,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.  Intel's better off (and all rumors point this way) to growing the E cores slightly and making that architecture the basis of the new P and E cores (like Zen vs Zen-C)",hardware,2025-11-06 21:48:50,11

Intel,nniukba,"Jaykihn attributes only density to the supposed heat issues, not BSPD. Which makes sense because the process guy and Stephen Robinson both talked about having to space out the signal and power wires when working with BSPD.  If they prioritized density, then it is possible that frequency could not reach the theoretical maximum due to crosstalk or heat issues.",hardware,2025-11-07 01:33:21,1
Intel,nngraag,"18A has always been low density, but expected to compensate for it with very efficient frequency scaling past peak perf/W. It was always going to struggle in laptops, where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints.  Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it. With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

Intel,nnh6cvf,"I actually suspect otherwise - speculation on my part, but I suspect that they were running into unexpected process issues when they pumped the frequency and/or voltage higher so they had to scale back performance.  It almost feels like a process bug that they discovered when making the actual chips.  They've also talked about kind of weak yields on 18A on their latest earnings call.  That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

This was supposed to be the node where Intel focused more on low voltage for data center and AI.    > where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints   That is not the case. ST turbo in -H series laptops has always been high, nearly on par with the desktop chips. At the power budgets being discussed, there's plenty available to hit whatever the silicon is capable of, and Intel's never been shy about pushing the limits of thermals.    And again, when you adjust for the power/thermal envelope, you *still* see a clock speed regression vs even ARL-H. The best possible outcome for Intel is actually that they can't hit the same peak voltage but look ok at low to mid.    > Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it   Server is typically low voltage, or mid voltage at most.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",hardware,2025-09-14 15:03:08,21

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",hardware,2025-09-18 03:04:06,7

The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,26

Intel,nery8a6,"Geekerwan's results are ***average*** power, not peak power, IIRC. These are real, actual frequency bins that Apple has allowed.  These frequency bins *will* be hit by some workloads, but just not nearly as long as SPEC & active cooling will allow. It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years. Seems like not a good compromise when you're eating more power per unit of performance.   That is, the A19 Pro on fp has skewed towards the flatter part of the perf / W curve.   >And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7

(there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",hardware,2025-09-18 20:16:47,5

They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise.

Intel,nfb1vqa,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear. What I meant is that the IPC of the E-core is so much higher than Tiger Lake that it's performance at 2.6GHz is surprisingly close to desktop Tiger Lake at 5GHz.  I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.

This just means that the massive inefficiencies are not inherint to the CPU uArch, but are a Problem of SoC design.  7W on a single core isnt super efficient, but its far lower than 20-31W. The question is if AMD is able to strip away a large part of those ~20W overhead, but that is not contingent on questions about CPU uArches.  And thats the point of the 1 Core vs 2 Core comparison.

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

Contradicting myself, but the 9070 XT has been selling at MSRP recently so that ~599 price tag for it does make it attractive, and you can just undervolt and set a negative power limit on it to make it insanely power efficient which would make it the better purchase potentially.  Money aside, the 5070 TI is probably the safest bet for you, but if you'd rather save some money and get bang for buck long term, then 9070 is a solid sleeper contender, especially if you are thinking of going Linux (which I highly recommend if you aren't locked into windows for a work program).",buildapc,2025-11-05 12:25:22,4

For me Windows has just become too bloated and digging its claws into every little thing that it's finally reaching ""straw that broke the back"" moment for me, and AMD is basically the bread and butter for Linux with the mesa drivers basically embedded in them out of the gate.

Intel,nn5hisa,"I have had both. Benched and tuned both. For your application it'll be better getting the 9700x in terms of performance.  However it'll take you to tune it, and it'll cost in terms of energy and heat.  9700x uses more and produces more heat if given the room to stretch. 7800x3d gets shafted at the factory and isn't allowed to run as hot and much lower vcore.  What people don't seem to understand when they talk about cpu bottleneck is where in the cpu is it.  For games like wow and other mmorpg that doesn't max out CPU but max out 1/2T l3 cache speed, zen5 is a better performer than zen4 x3d. So you'll be spending less up front and getting better performer.  For games like pubg arc raiders etc, latency and bigger l3 cache is more effective.  Finally do you care about 1% lows.  If you do, you need to both tune your ram subtimings as well as 9700x for the best performance.  And even then you may not catch the 7800x3d given the same tuning.  However at higher res than 1080p, at 2k etc, AVG fps they're basically neck and neck or trade blows game dependent.  Once again any game that favors l3 freq, max core freq the 9700x will move ahead given tuned.  And the rest that isn't about top end max freq but cache size and latency, 7800x3d will move ahead.

If you look at the US and UK in particular, who historically leaned more into capitalism and ""free"" market economics, both of their arts receive less relatively than they used to e.g. Hollywood writer strikes, UK councils gutting most of arts funding. In contrast, arts/culture is very healthy in Europe, which can be seen as more socialist.  Commercialism touches every aspect of society as those with power seek to consolidate it. There's no need to compete when you go past that point, you just gut costs/funding.   Take MS famously saying recently 30% of their code is generated by AI. That's purely for cost, and it's the result of living in a world where they no longer have any real competition, and no incentive to do better.   Now apply that to GPU's. It's not just gaming GPU's, but the actual mid-tier workstation cards that graphic designers, CAD designers, etc all rely on. A lot of arts and engineering also actually rely on GPU's now, as a side note.   NVIDIA can claim they live in a cost driven environment all they want.

Computer graphics are in a bit of an odd spot for me, where the performance of a lot of games with more conventional techniques is quite disappointing, but path tracing at the very high end is a true generational leap that we haven't seen in a long time. Like, on the level of introducing real-time lighting and shadows maps in the super early days of real-time 3D rendering.  I would say the biggest issue right now is that a lot of development has been put into making graphics *dynamic* again (baked light maps are very performant solutions to global illumination, but also enforced highly static worlds, whereas ray tracing can be fully dynamic), while the state of game development still hasn't really caught up with that.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,22
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.

(I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.

But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",AMD,2024-10-30 20:22:39,1

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*.

When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3

That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,kpv2g8f,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,AMD,2024-02-11 01:23:45,1
Intel,kpv5euk,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face.

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.

It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise.

If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",AMD,2023-10-30 20:36:21,12

We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.

You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm.

It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative.

Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling.

Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG.

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.

Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",AMD,2023-09-22 23:25:22,4

But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update.

If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",AMD,2023-08-19 14:24:33,7
Intel,jwuapdo,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense.

Intel,jx3nm3i,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",AMD,2023-08-21 06:56:43,1
Intel,jwv7qel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:05:22,2

Intel,jwuwjmm,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",AMD,2023-08-19 13:47:45,1

Intel,jwuithf,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.

Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Intel,2025-11-06 04:01:09,5

Intel,nncrc61,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Intel,2025-11-06 02:46:29,0
Intel,nnd4ak4,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Intel,2025-11-06 04:10:51,2

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Intel,2025-11-06 07:19:59,3

Intel,nirs4bu,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Intel,2025-10-10 13:41:08,29

Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games.

It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.

Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.

The main thing is that I want a sub 2kg laptop with dedicated GPU and 32GB RAM, so the main laptops I'm eyeing rn are either:  * 2023 ROG Zephyrus G14 * 2024 HP Omen Transcend 14  but their new RTX 4060 versions are still hovering around 1300 USD in my country, way above my budget.  So ofc I'm hoping that their price substantially goes down either during Black Friday or 12/12 sale, but do you think that they're even still worth pursuing or should I just focus on 2025 & upcoming laptops? (My third pick that fits my requirements is the new Legion 5, but that one's even more expensive atm)  Also technically there are three used laptop stores trying to sell a used RTX 4070 Omens to me at 1300 USD, but no way used stores are going to give any substantial Black Friday discounts",hardware,2025-11-08 12:54:16,2

And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,nmeds5z,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one. And the passage of time now positions early RDNA as a temporary measure, a stopgap until AMD figures out how to get back in the fight.  It remains quietly amusing how utterly wrong the YouTubers and online forums have misread the future about five-six years ago. Architecture/features/support, as it turns out, matter more than raster parity at a 5-10% discount.",hardware,2025-10-31 16:54:04,8

They quite clearly say 'Bug fixes' and 'maintenance mode' in that response from AMD Germany.      You think nVidia does driver optimization for 2000 and 3000 series cards? fuck no.. Those cards are also in 'maintenance mode'   making sure the game works with the card and bug fix and security patch if needed.      I can see why people are upset, but I also see it as AMD being transparent. Their older cards are in 'maintenance mode' now, which means they are still supported, will still get bug fixes, will still work with your games, but if you want the best experience, buy a newer card.      Nvidia does exactly the same, they just haven't given it a name.      Fight me 😂",hardware,2025-10-31 07:59:14,1
AMD,nmbeqwq,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.

I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time.  To be clear, AMD is still providing drivers -- they're just not providing new game-specific driver-level optimizations.  I'm not sure how much this actually matters for older cards, since engine support for RDNA 2 and earlier should be pretty dialed-in to the point where driver-level optimizations shouldn't be as necessary. Not supporting new Vulkan extensions could potentially be problematic, but I'm also not sure it matters if these extensions are meant to support hardware that RDNA 2 cards (and earlier) don't have.  [Vega and Polaris are also in this ""extended support"" phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/17qn9e3/amd_begins_polaris_and_vega_gpu_retirement/), and looking at the driver pages for a Vega and Polaris card (I chose the Radeon VII and the Radeon RX 480), their latest driver update was in August 2025, which isn't that long ago.

Back with GCN the AMD architecture was a bit more complex and developers used it poorly. Developers did stupid things like tessellating concrete barriers and the surface of the water to hell and back. So over time you would have real gains and the AMD cards would have a better lifespan than their Nvidia counterparts. The RX 580 was phenomenal.  I would call the fine wine back in the day more shitty developers than shitty drivers.  Fine wine ended with RDNA, it was much simpler to optimize and all over the consoles. That means RX 5000 series going forward don't get those same bumps over time and we've seen it.  AMD fans repeating fine wine these days are talking about a golden age of Radeon that has long since ended without ever having experienced it themselves.

But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing.

It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.   Yes this applies to all sorts of GCN hardware because they're extremely capable still. You can do shader emulated ray tracing on Vega and RDNA1 with playable performance.on Linux.

AMD,nmdmdmo,"> On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level, and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.  I think that's a little bit unfair towards AMD. On the kernel side, they put in the work with amdgpu, writing parts of it from scratch *and* getting it being accepted into the mainline kernel - which is a steep barrier to entry (the battles on the LKML were a fascinating read :) ), but which makes long-term support infinitely more viable due to the nature of Linux kernel development.  On the userland side: While RADV of course has been and still is first and foremost Valve-driven, the no AMD involvement hasn't been true anymore for a while. AMD driver devs have actively contributed to RADV for a while now, and recently they had the saliency to make Mesa RADV the officially supported Vulkan driver, going so far as to actually discontinue AMDVLK. And similar to the kernel side, being part of Mesa means a much higher likelihood of long-term support.",hardware,2025-10-31 14:39:47,2

The Z2 Extreme that is in the Ally X is a major improvement to the Aerith chip in the Steam Deck and for $350 more than the 1TB OLED Steam Deck you are getting a performance boost, more ram, bigger battery, and better I/O in the form of two USB4 ports including one that meets the spec for Thunderbolt 4.

Think of your i7 12700H as the Dodge Charger SRT-8 (or rebrand SRT Hellcat) producing 485 HP and 475 lb-ft from a 6.4 liter Apache V8. And the Core i9 12900HK is the Dodge SRT Demon with an all new 6.2 liter V8 and 2.7 liter supercharger rated for 808 hp and 770 lb-ft of torque.  amazing.  But yeah they are the same chip just the other one is faster and can be overclocked.  edit: But the thing is. 808 HP versus 485 HP you don't really need it on the road daily. You take the exact same 25 mph from a stand still stop sign to the next one the same as a Prius or Camry.  You go from your exit on the interstate to the next one at 65 mph just like everybody else. Except you have on tap 485 hp.   It is like playing counterstrike at 600 fps. For sure it is super fast, but you are still limited to max 120 fps for your own reflexes. And well generally internet speeds and the server speed will limit you. Because a 60 fps player can simply adjust for the delay on his computer while you need to speed up your own reflexes in order to handle that extra power.   All while that extra 540 fps doesn't do you a whole lotta good in the real world. Just like 808 hp doesn't do anybody anything on the real world road. Sure you can blast it and go fast.

This means that one would not be able to extend the cable using a standard USB-C 3.0 cable, which has these pins mapped only for unshielded USB 2.0 signals. Also this required the VirtualLink port to also detect the correct orientation of the USB-C plug to ensure that the USB 3.0 TX and RX lanes are correctly connected.  > In VirtualLink mode, there were six high-speed lanes active in the USB-C connector and cable: four lanes transmit four DisplayPort HBR 3 video streams from the PC to the headset while two lanes implement a bidirectional USB 3.1 Gen 2 channel between the PC and the headset. Unlike the classic DisplayPort USB-C alternate mode, VirtualLink has no USB 2.0 channels active, instead providing a higher speed USB 3.1 Gen 2 (SuperSpeed+) over the same A6, A7, B7, B6 pins. VirtualLink also required the PC to provide 15 to 27 watts of power.  > To achieve six high-speed lanes over USB-C, VirtualLink required special cables that conformed to version 1.3 of the USB-C standard and used shielded differential pairs for both USB 2.0 pairs.",hardware,2025-10-31 17:41:16,33

Board construction quality seemed ok, feature set was comparable to other entry level B650 boards and it was literally the cheapest AM5 board I could get from any Aussie retailer. The main downside was that the BIOS was pretty clunky. Looked very dated, it was hard to find features that the board did have (enabling RAM EXPO was a bit fiddly, but to be fair once I enabled it it worked great with no tweaking required) and it listed features that the board didn't have (There was a toggle for Intel Turbo Boost and hyperthreading... on an AMD board...). The RGB software also was pretty bad, very few RGB modes, slow and unresponsive, and the installer was in Mandarin. Like come on man if you're gonna sell this board in a Western market at least translate your installer into English.   My end review is that the product itself was OK with a few QoL problems but nothing major, but it's totally worth spending another $20 to get something like a Gigabyte B650M Gaming, or an ASUS B650M AYW, just because BIOS and software will be better, you're far more likely to keep getting BIOS updates from a major brand, and if you ever need to warranty claim something I'd rather try my luck with a big brand over Maxsun.",hardware,2025-11-06 22:37:02,2

Granted, P6 based Pentium III's weren't terribly far behind (and had the lead for short periods of time here and there) but the lead there on both frequency and IPC for AMD, with the biggest gap coming during the Netburst era (a truly dreadful design). Similarly, there were some bright spots during Intel's run for AMD, where the Phenom II in particular was a very solid upper midrange platform and the Athlon II's dervied from it were solid mid range to budget choices when taking cost into consider. That said, the construction cores (Bulldozer, Piledriver, Excavator) we're even less competitive than Netburst. There was essentially no redeeming factor to them (outside of super niche APU based builds where you could have a somewhat useful rig for less than the cost of a decent GPU).

CPU: I will use it mostly for gaming, but I tend to code every once and awhile with unity/vs2022, and while I don't know a whole lot, I know more cores usually means better performance when handling many tasks which I will need. If its negligible for that then I'll probably switch to the 9600x just because it is a lot cheaper.  GPU: Is the 9070XT truly necessary? I'm looking at the ""Gigabyte GAMING OC Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB Video Card"" and considering its about $200 cheaper, I might want that instead. I don't need the highest of qualities (1080p is fine for me, coming from a laptop with an i3 with 2 cores and integrated uhd graphics), as long as it can run games and my other needs smoothly, i can lose out on the 1440p or 4k. All I need it to do is run Ultra 1080p on games, I'll even settle for high considering anything other than ""the lowest possible settings"" is where I'm at currently. I'd ignore it and go with my gut but after a very quick search I saw the 9070 is quite a bit faster than the 9060, but once again, if the 9060 can handle what I need it too at 1080p ultra/high, I will take it for $200 less.  Notes: ~~I see when I put all this into the PCPartPicker website that I get the message ""The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition 42 CFM CPU Cooler may require a separately available mounting adapter to fit the Gigabyte B850 GAMING X WIFI6E ATX AM5 Motherboard."" Is this anything to actually be concerned about?~~    Ignore. Accidentally scrolled up to my list and put that cooler in instead of the one you put.

I did more research and(correct me if im wrong) but it seems like if you have rebar on it will be on in every game with Radeon gpu's but for Nvidia Gpus it is on selectively but you can force it on using Nvidia profile inspector. From what it seems there is even a difference between intel and amd cpu's on what rebar is used for and there is a whole settings called Intel CPU Exclusion so im guessing intel cpus don't work with rebar as much.,buildapc,2025-11-09 19:35:57,1

People also do other work on a PC that involves a GPU and a lot of times Nvidia is supported much better with applications and non-gaming work. They also value reliability over time.  2) Pricing and value depends entirely where you live and what you value in a GPU varies to begin with. Lots of people can't get AMD cards at MSRP still.  3) When one company has 94% market share over another, it's for good reasons. Many good reasons. And a lot of it is because many people have had problems with AMD over time. This is simply the facts, unless you want to argue with 94% of PC owners.  So $130 does in fact go quite a bit further than some benchmarks on YouTube, and lots of people will gladly pay more (or less) for the most reliable experience possible.",buildapc,2025-11-10 16:39:46,2

Most of the posts made in this subreddit and all other pc subreddits are game related.   2: There is a lot more to do outside of gaming true, but most people arent going to be missing out on anything in terms of efficacy by going with AMD. The only issue that you ""may"" have is either feature, or program related. Something that is not only not an absolute guaranteed issue, but is likely to not impact the average user.  This isnt pcmasterrace. This is buildapc. Most of the posts made are by your random joe who has little to no knowledge nor interest in pc's. Harping about production features to people who more than likely dont use their pc for production is inane.  >Value reliability means nothing if you dont expand on it. Pricing and value depends entirely where you live and what you value in a GPU varies to begin with. Lots of people can't get AMD cards at MSRP still.  No duh.

And a lot of it is because many people have had problems with AMD over time. This is simply the facts, unless you want to argue with 94% of PC owners.  I dont have to argue with 94% of PC owners, because your reasoning is flawed. Nvidia started making their gpu's in 1996, AMD 2006. Nvidia starting years before has allowed it to become more well known not only for the average user, but for prebuild, and laptop companies as well.    Likewise Nvidia isnt as succesfull as it is because of the consumer gpu market lol. Nvidia is as successful as it is because of data centers and ai.

AMD,nnxhk8d,"Everytime this happens, people cry foul about terrible journalism this or that, but... you guys (and me too, I'm involved on both sides) want the info about the leaks and rumors on upcoming hardware, or for example news warning about raising prices.   If we as authors ignored all this info and just wrote articles about press releases and product launches (yes, some angry readers have lectured me to do just that on not just one ocasion), you wouldn't like it either. And rightfully, because that would be useless.  A wise man once wrote that the information that ""it rained yesterday"" or ""it rains now"" is worthless, but ""it will rain tomorrow"" is something that has value. And that holds even if the information is not guaranteed (see weather forecast). Knowing about future stuff or being warned about future problems has it's value, often very high. The value is also higher if the information is available more in advance (""I know everybody sees the cloud but hear, it's going to rain in 2 minutes!"")   And that is why you (and me too as well) go to the internet and look for these kinds of news. People who get mad and selfrighteously offended (I suspect some enjoy the feeling of superiority?) when stuff like this happens miss the point, IMHO.  It's pointless to be offended about ""not checking extra sources/facts"" in context of hardware leaks. The leak itself more often than not tends to be the only source of the information. Sometimes somebody with contacts can ask people they know, but far from always. You guys act like you don't want to see anything that is ""not confirmed"" to be printed/published - but that is a pretty much not true. If you got what you wished in this regard, we would stay mostly blind about future hardware. You would probably not be satisfied. Actually, if you really preferred it to be like that, you can just not be following the leak churn on websites and social networks... but you probably want to, given how you are here.  Good HW news journalism (when we are talking about covering upcoming hardware and leaks like this) is not really about checking everything. What you mostly want is for the editors to have decent experience and insight, good intuition and good knowledge so that they are good at deciding what to rule out as nonsense, obvious fake or unlikely, and what to let through and publish as ""potentially good and interesting information that is not guaranteed, but useful to be aware of."" Resisting sensationalism and being able to tell bad sources from good is part of that.  (IMHO, VideoCardz tends to be among the better sites in that regard. If you only want to follow only a single news site, better idea for it to be VideoCardz than say, WCCFtech, heh. From the ones that are being called out, I follow others too, but even TPU and Tom's Hardware tend to be less reliable in this sort of sieving and judging the rumors).  \---------------------  And separately, thanks for the write-up, OP!",pcmasterrace,2025-11-09 13:51:54,2

AMD,nncq50o,Ok now put them in a actual laptop,AMD,2025-11-06 02:39:13,19
AMD,nncxreq,I think no RDNA 4 on these APUs makes them pretty much worthless for gaming. A 5060 laptop would be cheaper and better overall for gaming,AMD,2025-11-06 03:26:51,29

AMD,nnnkwvm,"Well, I guess there is one use, if you're into Linux mobile gaming it is pretty much your only reasonable option. NVIDIA drivers are kind of shitty on Linux. That's why I would consider this option in a mobile platform. It's got a very mature driver stack and AMD is generally plug and play on Linux.   You're usually talking about a single digit performance gap between Windows and Linux on a mature AMD GPU versus solid double digit gap on NVIDIA hardware.",AMD,2025-11-07 20:17:17,1

Tragic note, I have a 9070 XT and a 9800X3D. Had I known I would've just gotten a 5800X3D instead and stayed on AM4.  People base 9800X3D performance based on non-GPU bottlenecked benchmarks like those HUB and Nexus were putting out on launch, which means with a 4090/5090. Incidentally, anything short of a 5080 desktop does not see any discernible benefit on most titles, and even that is miniscule. Less so at 1080p.",AMD,2025-11-07 20:20:35,2

AMD,nnbr8vz,"It wouldn't be worth it to put a fully unlocked large chiplet with a cut down much smaller chiplet though, it wouldn't make sense as the cost to produce 6 core + 8060s would be almost the same as 8 core + 8060s.",AMD,2025-11-05 23:14:17,20

AMD,nnejgzv,No amount of power in the world would make 8060S faster than a 5060. It’s been tested to death even pushed to 140w in the few strix halo desktops.,AMD,2025-11-06 11:53:59,6
AMD,nnd3xrc,Real life buyers would prefer their money to go to meaningful upgrade. And in a laptop it means always prioritising the gpu for the common 2560x1600 resolution.,AMD,2025-11-06 04:08:21,0
AMD,nnbtzh0,It would be a purely gaming focused product. 6c vs 8c is no difference especially at the GPU level of 40CU. Would be good sense to use bin-failed cpu dies to reach price points the market will actually pay.,AMD,2025-11-05 23:29:49,2
AMD,nnhmiol,"IDK. If it's better for gaming like he says, they could literally sell it at the same price.",AMD,2025-11-06 21:27:13,1
AMD,nnd2d3q,"Cities Skylines 1, yes. Cities Skylines 2 can use at least 16 CPU cores though (I believe you do get bottlenecked by single core at some point).",AMD,2025-11-06 03:57:28,3
AMD,nni9an5,"Sure, but that doesnt mean people wouldnt be interested in a part that is more performant and power efficient.",AMD,2025-11-06 23:27:45,1
AMD,nne1pu4,"X3D CPU means that more bandwidth can be reserved to the GPU whithout using any MALL cache, not to mention that the saved power can be allocated to the GPU it would improve the graphics situation as well.

AMD,nneun1d,I think it scales up to 64 or 128,AMD,2025-11-06 13:11:11,2
AMD,nnehgiv,"agree, they share ram, so x3d would help more than on desktop in bandwidth saturated scenarios i think.",AMD,2025-11-06 11:37:51,3
AMD,nnej95y,The MALL on strix halo is already off die on another chiplet. The cpu accessing it for the cpu would airway incur an extreme latency penalty. All ryzen L3 cache is on the same CCD as the cpu die. Why do you think MALL was remotely relevant to the cpu?,AMD,2025-11-06 11:52:18,1
AMD,nneivcl,I’m sure you can find at least one user in the whole world that wants a 9955HX3D paired with a 5050.   That doesn’t mean it’s not an extremely unbalanced combo for gaming and the lack of such real world product proves it.,AMD,2025-11-06 11:49:17,1
AMD,nneuf6l,"Strix Halo doesn't use the standard Zen 5 chiplets, it uses a custom version with a better interconnett, that's why the CCDs are right to the side of the IOD instead of far away like on desktop part, so no, there wouldn't be the usual latency penalty if AMD were to set MALL cache as usable by the CPU.",AMD,2025-11-06 13:09:51,1
AMD,nnf4ul9,"Most eSports and MMO games would run just fine on such a GPU while benefiting massively from the extra CPU horsepower. It doesn't exist because the product doesn't exist. Strix Halo as it is, is a niche product and a novelty. If strix halo can exist at all, I wouldn't rule out a future iteration with support for x3d.",AMD,2025-11-06 14:09:45,1
AMD,nnkaff7,Yeah Wow and FFXIV players seek configs like these. Though a 9800X3D is enough.,AMD,2025-11-07 08:02:04,1
AMD,nneybbu,"The CCDs themselves are architecturally the same and only the interconnects are different. And not being as bad as on desktop Ryzen doesn’t mean it’s usable, cross CCX latency is bad enough even on the same die (Zen 2 CCD’s divided L3 cache and literally all of their monolithic APUs come to mind, all have horrid latency across CCX).",AMD,2025-11-06 13:33:00,1
AMD,nnfr0w8,>It doesn't exist because the product doesn't exist.  It doesn't exist because there is no demand. There is absolutely nothing technically infeasible to pair 9955HX3D with 5050.,AMD,2025-11-06 16:01:17,1
AMD,nng0or4,"Well, that's a 16 core CPU though. AFAICT, there's no 8-core x3d SKU for laptops. We're discussing an 8 core strix halo CPU aren't we?",AMD,2025-11-06 16:47:14,1
AMD,nnzrwpr,"The 7500f beating the 9500f in CyberPunk is strange to me.         Also the 8400f is such a poor performer, based off the numbering you wouldn't expect it to perform worse than all the 7000s.",AMD,2025-11-09 20:45:26,30

AMD,nngbzic,"Hey! I can actually answer (anecdotally) this directly. I've played A LOT of BF6 on my old rig (Ryzen 7 5800XT & 2080 Ti/5070 Ti) and when I switched to the 5070 Ti, my performance was just a bit better, but it was only sitting around 60-90fps on large modes. I turned on the simple in game performance metrics, and I saw that while my GPU fps was nearly 200, my CPU was the one limiting my actual displayed framerate.   Two weekends ago, I did a brand-new build with a 9800X3D and 48GB 6000 CL30 and my FPS was unlocked to 170-200fps @ 1440p on large modes (conquest/breakthrough) without any drops.

AMD,nnfuafq,This is [not my experience](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/battlefield-6-performance-benchmark/3.html#:~:text=Test%20System) and I'm only trying to extrapolate [the data from the 9070xt benchmark in BF6 with FSR on balanced](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/battlefield-6-performance-benchmark/6.html) to 7900xtx (and [7900xtx is head to head with 9070xt](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/battlefield-6-performance-benchmark/5.html)) so I'm saying yes - you will get more FPS on average (not too much) but you will 100% get better 0.1% and 1% lows which will result in smoother gameplay and less noticeable fps dips.     Is the upgrade worth it? It's up to you. If the only game you plan to play for the next N years is BF6 and you want the best performance then surely go for 9800x3d,AMD,2025-11-06 16:16:37,4
AMD,nni9res,My system with 9800X3D has significantly higher minimum framerate than my other system with 5800X3D in BF6. I'm sure the difference between 5900x and something like 7600X3D would be even greater.  9800X3D with 9070XT @ 3440x1440 is locked at my 175 FPS framerate limiter in BF6 (I play with a mix of mostly High/Medium settings instead of all Overkill),AMD,2025-11-06 23:30:26,5

Turing (2018) has dedicated RT/Tensor cores specifically designed for RT/DLSS, whereas RDNA3 (2022 - **4 YEARS LATER**) doesn't, and with that, I think I said it all.  In fact, I'm already sure RDNA 3 and even 4 will have the same faith, as UDNA/RDNA 5 will be a totally different architecture - which, by the way, will be literally a copy of Turing from a core perspective, which was released, once again, in 2018 -- 'Radiance Cores' are the ray-tracing cores, and 'Neural Arrays' are the tensor cores - obviously, much more powerful than Turing's, but you get the point - AMD is about 9 years behind nVIDIA in terms of architecture philosophy at this point.  So do not act surprised that 5700 XT didn't have more value compared to 2070S at 100$ more as some of people thought, there's a reason ""nVIDIA -50$"" doesn't work anymore, those 50$ will bite you in your ass next time and people have woken up.",AMD,2025-11-03 08:06:51,10

AMD,no63388,"After reading all of these Phoronix articles about older AMD GPUs still being worked on in Linux, I grabbed an R9 390 from my friend who had it sitting in his attic after upgrading to an RTX3060 a few years ago.  The only pain point was blacklisting RadeonSI and forcing the AMDGPU driver to be used. After that, I was able to play Arc Raiders during their Server Slam test. On absolute lowest settings and Ultra Performance FSR, of course, as the R9 390 is multiple generations older than the minimum recommended RX580. Not only did it work, but it ran at a borderline playable 50-60ish fps (at least in my limited testing, no intense PvP or anything). Oh, and mangohud caused massive stutters. Protip, don't use a performance overlay on a GPU this old.  As stated in the article, it doesn't seem that there is any reason why AMDGPU shouldn't be the default. These GPUs support Vulkan and are usable for modern gaming, but only for those who know to force the driver change.

Or Hell Divers 2 that had issues at launch, or Dying light 2 that had RGB laser show bug outside the Radeon boost issues the game had for 1 and half year or so more or less.  As well as some unity based games having random driver timeouts on least RDNA3 due those games not handling the high clock speeds that well on stock.  They may be dropping support, but they never properly supported these gpu's to begin with and now RDNA3 we just waiting for games to be playable, by the time it gets fixed it wont matter anymore, i could not play wow for example during the entire Dragonflight expansion and wasted 200+ euros on a game and subscription that i could not play for almost entire expansion, so i am happy i can finally play it again.  Hopefully i can as well during midnight expansion which has its first beta on 11 november now.  The attitude AMD often has oh its just hardware issue 99% of the time its a driver issue and their vanguard program users unable to reproduce issues, simply due lack of information required to fix these issues, because sometimes its not easy to reproduce however for those having issues, avoiding the issue is as simple as simply not playing the game with the issue, as much that sucks.  And there is the Radeon tax you pay you only get to play what the vanguard program users like to play, you want to play that latest game that AMD has not enough users playing well tough luck and sometimes its also because NVIDIA simply makes the game unavaible until launch so AMD can only fix it as soon as its released, so NVIDIA wins by default because AMD cannot support the game to begin with at launch.     So yeah that AMD is just straight out saying they putting RDNA1/2 in Maintenaince mode not supporting the latest games really pisses me off, but its not like they doing that right now anyway even RDNA4 suffers from issues with games at launch.  But i will compliment AMD for finally working with game devs these days they been doing that for over a year or 2 now and probably longer, but they have to figure out how to do things better, because this is not acceptable.  I could litterally spend time making memes out of these driver issues and actual proof that these issues are actually real driver issues, but i do not like a burnout or work for free, which is why i rejected joining the vanguard program few times in the past, alto i have cooperated with some users figuring things out even testing things, but AMD should honestly do this them self.  But i am still avaible to do so eitherway if i am able to do that, but as some one hat has no job AMD could really do something about it and start hiring people for these type of things, so they can actually fix things rather then ignore these issues.",AMD,2025-10-31 23:35:56,1

When the Vega 64/1080 ti where pretty competitive in Blender Cycles at the time where it depended on the work load (lots of textures to load? Vega wins with it's memory. A lot of calculations the 1080 ti would edge out in render time. Pretty much 2 years after they just dropped support and in that time NVIDIA has secured such a lead that the 9070 XT is around the performance of a 3060 and 3060 ti in rendering. 7900xtx without zluda is around 4060 tier, and 7900xtx with zluda was slightly below 4060 ti.)",AMD,2025-11-01 08:55:32,1

Now that AI is starting to be a bigger part of overall profitability, your voice is getting smaller and smaller. Gaming is evolving into a service as it is. Hardware eventually won’t matter much.

Providing game optimization for 2+ year old, previous generation, GPU's requires a lot of work and expense.  AMD has to constantly be releasing new tech, at a ridiculous pace just to keep up.  Thus, cutting off support for ""old"" products is not unheard or, or unreasonable.  The RDNA 1 and 2 generations are nearly 5 years old.  While they did release new product within the last couple years, it was primarily for the Chinese market.

I’m not gonna lie, I usually upgrade my GPU every 5 years and I’ll prob build a new PC soonish so even if AMD’s standard is now 5 years for Radeon, I won’t be affected but people keeping their cards for a decade will be.  I understand that from AMD’s perspective it’s hard because all of these GPU arch’s a a bit different but it’s just a rough move going forward.

AMD was widely praised for using 16GB of VRAM in the 6000 series specifically because it would likely allow the cards to age well as VRAM became a larger consideration, by cutting driver support to maintenance mode they've now done they exact opposite.

But if you read thru the comments there are others talking about the Vega II.. how about you go join their discussion.  There isn't some magical division in support. It's not like all the later Vega offshoots saw good or long support they were basically retired and neglected all the same at the same time they stopped giving a shit about the 56/64. It's the same topic, not a different one just because you arbitrarily want to ignore half of ""vega"".  >Also, what support for what card, up till they ended support are you talking about? If it's the VEGA 56/64 driver support had very few problems over all. You just had to turn off fast start up to avoid windows BS from screwing stuff up. Most problems people had where user error. Of course we are in a generation where people want to blame everything else. Heck my Vega 64 is still running strong in my granddaughter's computer. She's happily playing sims 4 and other games with no issues.  There were a shitload of API support issues back when I had the VII. Broken lighting and shaders in some games wasn't uncommon. Driver regressions happened at times resulting in me figuring out how to revert to older drivers on a game by game basis. And then past a point they couldn't even be bothered fixing wattman issues for it.   Yeah I still have a Vega56 in a family members computer it ""works"" (but not entirely without sometimes having to disable things or change configs... browsers in particular can be headaches but I won't pin that entirely on AMD), but all the people pretending AMDs support has been good and running to their defense on this is a fucking laugh a minute.",AMD,2025-10-31 15:45:31,3

Desktops and browsers are also moving to Vulkan+DX12 (Gnome's vulkan compositor, chrome and firefox are both shipping vulkan+dx12 backends and requiring them for full webgpu support, etc).  The issue is also when hardware support is ended early like this, then it pushes back the time when developers can start requiring new features to run software, and alternative code paths for hardware that lacks whatever required feature support aren't free to develop or maintain (and in some cases mean you essentially have 2 separate renderers, eg. bindless vs traditional/non-bindless).  This is one of the main reasons software developers are pissed about Intel getting rid of AVX512, because it pushes back the time when devs can start requiring it by ~5 years (meaning they now still have to wait 10+ years they until they can start making it mandatory, instead of in 5-6 years if Intel kept AVX512 support).",AMD,2025-11-01 07:51:10,1

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

AMD,ngbqjhe,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Intel,2025-09-26 15:54:51,40

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.

AMD,ngcutw5,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores.

The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1

Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.

The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed.

However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up).

AMD,n0ap7lk,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Intel,2025-06-28 20:15:41,11

AMD,n046z2m,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Intel,2025-06-27 19:06:33,3

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue. Keep me posted on what you find with that CPU usage spike and reliability monitor - those are likely our smoking guns!",Intel,2025-08-25 21:12:03,1
AMD,navgo8f,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification. For anyone building new systems, Intel recommends using RST instead of VROC, but existing X299 users can continue using VROC with supported drives from the qualified vendor list. ***Support is now limited to sustaining mode with no new features or drive certifications planned, as confirmed in the support article you referenced.***",Intel,2025-08-27 01:43:49,1

For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists.
