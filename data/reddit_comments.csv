Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

Intel,ne6f8e1,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",hardware,2025-09-14 15:10:44,31

Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least.

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working.

We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.

I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.  I think the real question you should ask is what price point and hardware class are you looking for and what kind of support do you need (if you just need llama.cpp to run, then either is fine, tbt).",hardware,2025-05-20 10:05:09,2

Intel,mt4vsoz,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,12

After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet.

But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs.

Intel,n94duvw,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",buildapc,2025-07-22 14:26:29,8
Intel,n4iwdf8,"Using my 3-fan B580 OC for 1440 gaming and it does a good job. I love its non existent noise level. Back in march I bought it for 330€. Updated driver is released like every 1-3 weeks. I appreciate intel's clean and intuitive driver GUI. I love the way the driver handles crashes, it's exemplary. The driver literally invites to try out some OC. Don't regret my B580. If I'd buy a new card right now, I'd be torn apart between B580 or 9060 XT.   But my main goal was/is a decent gaming experience with a  reasonable power consumption. I don't have a problem to fine tune settings to get stable 60 FPS and a flatline frametime. And it was a decision against NVIDIA, against their dominant position, which they exploit and hurt the market.",buildapc,2025-07-22 13:46:37,6
Intel,n4k7xid,It has bad driver overhead and isn't great for now end systems.  It also doesn't have that great price to performance now that both AMD and Nvidia have released newer gpus.  I would take the 5060 over it at 1080p.  Far less driver overhead for Nvidia.  Dlss 4 is far better than xess,buildapc,2025-07-22 17:28:36,1
Intel,nco631m,"To some degree, yes. But don't expect amazing energy efficiency with the card, its somehow the same performance as the RTX4060, but is 190 watts. Even if the 12GBs of VRAM makes it suitable for 1440p gaming",buildapc,2025-09-06 02:54:35,1

Intel,n4is3qg,"Looking at benchmarks, it is really quite underwhelming compared to my old 3070 Ti (which I just sold for $295), which was enough to do 1440p at 144FPS at medium settings. It's definitely not a 1440p card that's going to give you high fps on modern titles. imo a proper 1440p card would be more like a card like a 5070 Ti which can actually do 1440p 144+ fps at highest settings, but 1440p and above with highest settings aren't really budget territory. You'll find that a majority of PC gamers are still playing at 1080p because 1440p isn't offering a great experience on cards lower than a 3070. And I would do the same myself if I had such a low end card.",buildapc,2025-07-22 13:23:48,-2
Intel,nco5tz7,"The 3070ti is a good card, but not that high in performance. Also that card WAS a 1440p capable card, now it can't go any higher than 1080p due to a lack of VRAM, not unless you had that rare 16GB version (which only a few were made)  The B580 can still very much do 1440p 60fps ultra quality, since ultra quality in games is more suited for 1440p compared to maximum settings",buildapc,2025-09-06 02:53:01,1
Intel,n6orlng,"Most tasks in 3D/CG/VFX are predominantly single threaded, until you simulate (not always), render or export something when more multithreaded performance is nice to have available. A 7600 has solid single core performance and in day to day performance will be great.  2x8GB is a mistake though, at least get 2x16GB - preferably 6000cl30 (cl32 and cl36 are fine if the price difference is big). You can save on the cooler for now, use the stock one (comes with a 7600) until she has enough saved for an upgrade.  The Intel Arc A750 is certainly a contentious choice. The only reason I'd go arc at that price point is if she'll be doing a lot of high res video editing, otherwise I'd look at alternatives, possibly second hand. A 3060 12GB would be a nice to have for 3D as NVidia is completely dominant in that space, but you'd probably need some second hand luck; I find them for around 200 EUR in the Netherlands. It'll perform a bit better than the A750 in gaming too, and has way better software support.  You can always save on the case and may be able to shave off a bit going for an mATX board, though less than 140 EUR for a wifi one is unlikely.",buildapc,2025-08-03 12:58:30,5
Intel,n6osl9e,"All parts look good but something to consider is some software just runs better on nvidia than others. I know this is true with video editing so maybe look at any applications she’ll need to run and see how the performance is before going with the intel card.   This is as good as I could manage being 100 over budget assuming the applications for vfx, cgi etc would play nicer with an nvidia card but don’t know for certain.

It produces way better images than my 6600XT and noone but noone simply comments on overall image quality ..anyway I have hundreds of legal Steam games no cracked eh I also own the Epic games version.  See this damn card had a driver update while I had it that improves the performance and that's good its what we want but once the features drop and performance drops (for me anyway) after the next driver update I had to call it.  Its the poor driver software stack.  The hardware has serious potential!  A770 is maxed.  I see this B580 ownership  as I leased the card for the summer +$60.      Can you buy from the [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) USA website for our cost?? Shop our stores in the USA.   I should remind you the Steam cold crashes suck.  I have an Asus 850w Platinum for it and I know there's no power fail issue sooo its a goner.  Im old enough to say ive seen this before.

Intel,ndc08oa,"So this is the Intel Arc B50. It's an *extremely* power limited BMG-G21 with only 16 Xe2 cores (B580 has 20) and only a 128 bit memory bus, limiting memory performance to just 224 GB/s: B580 has 456 GB/s.  To get power down to 70 watts and be slot powered, it has utterly castrated the BMG-G21. Only 4 MB L2 cache is enabled (of the 18 MB on the silicon) and it runs 1,000 MHz slower than it does in B580. Some sources claim 8 MB L2 is enabled, so this appears to be a bit unsure at the moment. It's not remotely B580's 18 MB and Intel's dGPU caching architecture is still a train wreck from its IGP origins.  What Intel has done is given it a similar memory config to AMD's 7600XT, 128 bit GDDR6 and 16 GB of it and cut the BMG-G21 down so far it can barely do anything. It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.  It could potentially be useful for AI, since Battlemage has strong INT8 performance, hobbyist level AI is all about CUDA and PyTorch. PyTorch will run on AMD fairly well, but Intel has pretty shit compatibility here and the card's performance will be inadequate for anyone wanting to play games on it.

All this while running on slot power, so it can go into most servers.  Are there cards that offer better performance? Sure, but I have no need for the extra headroom, and this card is a massive leap over the a50 that was just shy of being good enough imo.

Intel,ndcdps9,"If you're running the likes of Bentley MicroStation or Autodesk Civil3D (some of the apps I look after at work) on this little thing, you're taking your workstation back to IT, telling them to ram that little toy up their arses, and to get you a real workstation.  Engineering and architecture workstations are about rasterisation performance. The designs and drawings have to be rendered quickly and smoothly on your two 4K monitors, which a stripped back and power-throttled 70 watt BMG-G21 isn't going to do.  For very entry level visualisation, we use RX 7600XTs with 16 GB, they have AutoDesk and Bentley certified drivers and enough VRAM and rasterisation to handle it. The RTX 4060 Ti isn't that bad there either, again you need the 16 GB version. On the next refresh of the low end workstations, they're probably going to end up being 9060XT and 5060Tis. Both of those would smash this little thing silly.  To that, I'm not sure who Intel wants to sell this to. $350 isn't serious money and it's competing with gaming-intended GPUs (which are utterly fine for visualisation and design) of much higher performance. It doesn't have substantially more RAM than competing products, it doesn't ECC protect the RAM and workstations generally don't care for slot powered cards either way. The ones we use come as standard with 800 watt PSUs and our choice of ""gaming"" CPUs like Ryzens or Cores, or Threadrippers and Xeons - Xeons are a bit less popular these days.  I'm seeing only an argument here for it being a solid SFF video card. It's the most powerful thing you can run in a 75 watt slot power budget... ~~but it isn't half-height.~~  [Yes it is.](https://www.servethehome.com/intel-arc-pro-b50-review-a-16gb-sff-mini-gpu/) So yeah, a solid SFF card.

Intel,nddjnu0,"The answer is kind of long, but most ARM chips (probably all) can’t emulate/simulate x86, however there is lots of software that does this. Under Windows it has kernel-level ARM to x86/64 translation for Windows binaries. Compatibility is pretty decent but it’s hard to tell under gaming since there’s no GPU drivers for anything but embedded ARM graphics.  Under Linux, it’s a totally different story. You have Box64 and FEX-EMU. I switched to all ARM years ago but it came with a learning curve. Compared to three years ago, there’s many high performance games and performance reaches about 50-70% of native x86 performance.  If you wanna see some games running on ARM you can check out some videos I made almost 3 years ago below. I cover native ARM games, ARM games running under Box64, games running under Box64/Wine, and games running under Box64 and Steam Proton.

I’m sure there is many settings that don’t change fidelity a lot but eat up fps, so putting some to low and some to high may be a better experience. This also seems pretty damn general of a spec sheet here, almost like it’s useless based on some things here.   Throw on dlss with the 3070 ti and enjoy probably like 80 fps.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,22
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",AMD,2024-08-02 03:44:51,1
Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",AMD,2024-10-30 18:32:02,1
Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,66

Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.

Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7

They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.

Intel,k7795r7,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,AMD,2023-10-31 07:28:35,4

I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets.

Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative.

Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others.

So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.

Nvidia isn't exactly paying AMD even when they hold 90-95% of the market. Legislative scrutiny tends to come from manipulative practices, not from just selling a better product.

AMD,nedgds6,"One out of three. Yep interesting and overlooked. I also wondered why I couldn't find L1 cache numbers for RDNA4 anywhere but in hindsight it's obvious.  L1 is per Shader Array (half WGP partition of a Shader Engine) not WGP.  L2 cache redesign is more aimed towards negating the 384 -> 256 bit MC config from 7900 XTX -> 9070 XT. 9070 XT Infinity cache is so fast that the effective BW is actually higher than 7900 XTX's despite -33% lower mem BW.  Oh for sure. The L1 was never a good design. Probably tons of cache thrashing due to small size, it really wasn't that much bigger than LDS, pre RDNA 3 it was actually the same size as one WGP LDS. Crazy to think about a mid level cache shared by 5 WGPs only having the same cache size as one LDS!  >I suspect that AMD would increase the LDS (AMD now calls it ""shared memory"" like Nvidia) to 192kb or 256kb and give it shared L1 cache functionality.  A 256kb L0+LDS addressable mem slab similar to Turing would help AMD a lot. That's already planned in GFX12.5 / CDNA 2 where they plan to allow greater LDS and L0/texture cache allocation flexibility similar to how Volta/Turing does this.  RDNA 5 could go beyond this even, but we'll see, perhaps M3 style L1$ with Registers directly in it.

One for L0 cache and LDS and one for instruction caches similar to how NVIDIA Turing and later does it.  But the overhauled scheduling with WGS mentioned by Kepler (see my prev posts in here) does mean that the Shader Engine will need some sort of shared mid level cache for its autonomous scheduling domain.   So I think L1 will make a return but this time one big L1 shared between entire Shader Engine and a proper capacity like let's say 1MB perhaps even more (2MB?). That could explain why the L2 is being shrunk so massively on RDNA5 according to the specs shared by MLID. 24MB L2 for the AT2 die IIRC. That die will have 70 CUs and should perform around a 4090 in raster. That's a far cry from the 9070 XTs 64MB or the 4090's 72MB.,hardware,2025-09-15 16:49:16,1

AMD opting to effectively mid L2 and L3 into one cache in-between like NVIDIA's L2, which is slightly higher latency than AMD's L2, seems like a wise decision.

Of course AMD is also extremely area focused in their designs as well since this uarch will likely go into consoles, so it will need to be cost-optimized in a way nvidia doesn't do.  With these things said, the LDS is used for matrix multiplication on both AMD and Nvidia designs, and with Blackwell Nvidia also added a dedicated cache for the tensor cores on top of the LDS. Since AMD is currently behind Nvidia they need to catch up, and just relying on their old ways of trying to implement features in compute shaders isn't going to cut it - they _need_ dedicated silicon for both matmul and caches to match Nvidia. But then again they probably won't since it needs to be cost optimized for consoles, I think rdna5 will be a dud on laptop/desktop for this reason unless Nvidia decides to not care about this market segment anymore.

Yikes. Yep really bad.  L0 vector cache/data cache/texture cache is directly coupled to TMUs and RT cores reside within those. At least that's the way it's shown in the  But if you talk about the instruction cache and scalar cache yeah prob no changes there.  There's no change it's just increased flexibility. So each workload can change the ratio between L0 vector and LDS depending on the workload. Different µarch but Turing did this as well, it's all about increased flexibility but that'll obviously depend on workload. Tradeoff between L0 latency and spillover to LDS.  That would make sense.    But I don't see it getting to 256kb. But 256kB total split between L0+LDS and variable depending on workload as indicated in LLVM for CDNA5, spotted by Kepler\_L2.

It's just speculation and I'm not a semiconductor professional but disaggregated scheduling would benefit from a lower latency mid level cache. IF RDNA 5 is iterative then prob not, if it's clean slate not seen since GCN then really anything could be on the table. There's also patents that fundamentally overhaul how caches work, one that I talked about in a earlier reply that boosts cache hit rates massively, by carefully selecting data that benefits being in L1 and shunning other data that would otherwise cause cache thrashing and lower cache hit rates significantly.

Guess we'll have to wait for GTC 2026 on that one though. No real specs for CPX rn.  RDNA 5 is as co-design between Sony and AMD and it's pretty much guaranteed that there's a heavy focus on AI and RT. Watch the PS5 Pro december coverage around SIE presentation by Cerny and DF interview. The guy is all in on ML and RT. He dictates what Sony gets in PS6 and AMD will have to match that whether they like it or not.    Raster is solved so Sony would rather gimp that by 15-20% and invest heavily in RT and ML than waste all silicon on raster. Nothing is confirmed though but they can't rely on raw perf anymore. PS6 can only differentiate itself on features so that's what they'll push.  RDNA 4 has eq. TFLOPs ML perf compared to NVIDIA. Look at the specs sheet of a 4080 vs 9070XT. Only thing missing is FP4 to compete with 50 series but nextgen will have that.

AMD,ndett58,"Okay so a few corrections because your understanding of the situation is totally off: the driver isn't doing a DLL swap currently for FSR4. It's actually the FSR3.1 SDK that's implemented in the game that's doing the swap. Also one more correction: ALL FSR 3.1 games use a DLL. The only thing that isn't standard is the use of the AMD provided and signed DLL. But all 85-ish games mentioned in the article here still use the signed FSR3.1 DLLs. The blacklist for FSR4 is empty now: now all titles that have the official, signed FSR3.1 DLL can be upgraded.   The FSR3.1 SDK has a function included that checks to see if the driver has allowed an FSR4 upgrade for a specific title (and setting the option in Adrenaline will toggle this value). If the FSR3.1 SDK sees that value sets, it grabs the FSR4 DLL from the driver files directly, and uses that instead. FYI, this is also why FSR4 can be injected on Linux in exactly the same fashion - Proton supports setting this registry key that indicates whether an FSR4 upgrade is possible or not. Currently, Adrenaline does not let you toggle this value to enable the FSR4 upgrade for titles that use a non-signed version of FSR3.1 - so if a developer makes a couple of small changes or tweaks to the FSR3.1 SDK and/or just decides to compile their own DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade will not be an option in that title (at least, at the moment).  However, members of the Optiscaler Discord have tested that if you replace a game's non-signed FSR3.1 DLL with the signed official DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade toggle does appear in Adrenaline.   > Important note - FSR 4 is not compatible with FSR 3.1 titles that run on the Vulkan® API or use non-standard methods of integration of FSR 3.1 into their games, such as using third-party plug-ins or methods that do not use the signed FSR 3.1 DLL.  > In short, some devs shipped unsigned FSR 3.1 DLLs from older plugin versions and FSR4 won't support that.   > Easy fix that should work - replace the FSR 3.1 DLL with the signed one from FFX SDK 1.1.4/FSR 3.1.4  This is actually something AMD could do in the way Nvidia does with DLSS4 DLL swapping in their driver as an experimental feature.

Apple can get away without SMT because they can keep the core well fed enough not to need it. This comes from better branch prediction, more bandwidth, bigger OoO circuitry, etc...  If Apple wanted to have SMT on their cores they could, but then the resources would get shared between different threads which could hurt single-threaded performance.

AMD,ndomwpv,">It's the age old ""are we comparing single thread or single core performance?"".   Not really. The question is simple: are we testing *one* instruction stream or two?  Many applications are bound by the performance of single-threaded, thus 1T is equivalent on AMD, Apple, Intel, Arm, etc. cores.  Any test using SMT is, by definition, a *multi-thread* benchmark. It means the application is feeding *two* instruction streams: the traditional single-core applications ***are*** single-thread.

AMD,ndoy9f9,"That is not true what so ever, SMT was made to make sure you take full use of the core while the other thread has unused parts of the CPU, that happens on Apple CPUs as well, 1T doesn't take the full width of the architecture that's why they focus so much on making sure branch prediction is the best in the world.  SMT is only used ""effectively"" in throughput oriented workloads, for example, SMT can reduce gaming performance, not increase it. ARM makes SMT enabled cores for automotive because there's a reason for it, due to a ton of threads it needs to handle the workloads in real time.

No you are confusing things. Apple core can only run one thread at a time. It doesn't have SMT. Apple core uses extreme ILP (instruction level parallelism) to take advantage of the width of the core but you can't have multiple logical threads use the core without context switching.  > 1T doesn't take the full width of the architecture that's why they focus so much on making sure branch prediction is the best in the world.  This is wrong as well. An advanced branch predictor is far more important to the performance of the long pipeline cores such as Zen or Intel P cores. Because a branch missprediction is much more costly when you have a long pipeline. AMD's and Intel's branch predictors are quite sophisticated for this reason.

Zen 5 is a pretty big and wide core by x86 standards, and AMD knows that it's difficult to find instruction level parallelism in x86 (more than it is for ARM at least). So they optimised the core's design for maximum performance with SMT. As a consequence they opted for 2x 4-wide decode instead of a more complex 8-wide that can also do 2x 4 (for SMT).   This is also a consequence of AMD targeting server workloads, which Apple doesn't.

This doesn't hinge on whether the chip itself has high or low inherent latency. In fact the chiplet design of the Ryzen is known for poor latency.  I was just saying that the 9950X draws 40W idle by design and this number doesn't reflect its efficiency. You could turn off SoC OC mode and get 10-15W idle. But even then most of the power draw is due to the SoC and the Infinity Fabric. AMD's chiplet design is inherently bad at minimizing idle power draw, x86 or not.

It very rarely happens, as evident by Apple's stable market share.  Apple has steadily held single digit market share of systems for decades regardless of chips they used, and now that chunk of the market is exclusively served by Apple chips, with no way for AMD to compete regardless of how they perform. Likewise, Apple does not attempt to compete by selling chips for ~90% of desktops, handhelds or laptops that don't run MacOS, so they don't notably threaten AMD's business regardless if they're faster or slower.   In other words, for 9 out of 10 desktop/laptop/handheld buyers, the performance of Apple desktop/laptop/potential handheld chips does not matter as that performance and those chips cannot be in any way utilized in the software environments that people actually use - there is no way you can buy an Apple chip to accelerate those workloads as is.",hardware,2025-09-11 21:27:27,12

Cutting out another core or two doesn't really make a difference in terms of direct weight loss since the cores don't really weigh much.

I need to use old versions of apps, and sideload them, for a ton of things.  Email apps (old versions of K-9 Mail, as an example) because the functionality in newer versions is broken or because the UI is awful.  Several ""Smart home"" / ""IoT"" apps because the company is dead or the old hardware I have is now ""unsupported"".  For one specific example, I have an old lighting setup and the hub and bulbs work perfectly, but the app was pulled from the store in favor of a new version. The new version of the app won't work with my hub unless I update the hub firmware and lose basic functionality that they put behind a paywall and ""cloud service"" for spying.  File manager apps because Android is fucking awful and constantly changes the file system and breaks things, all in the name of ""protecting"" me when I'm trying to do something as simple as move a file on my device to another folder or organize downloads and attachments from email.  And there are also times where I downloaded an app on one device only to be told it's ""not compatible"" or ""not available"" on another device due to bullshit fake requirements, regional settings, things being pulled from the store for new downloads but still present for existing users / updates, or Google's awful practice of beta testing releases to random subsets of users and hiding them from others (Google's not the only one guilty of this).  If I download it from elsewhere, or extract it from one device that has it, then sideload it onto another device, it almost always works just fine.

The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz.

But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron.

Very rarely we see such leap within a single gen.    LGA 1851 was supposed to support 3 gens but became a single gen platform because Meteor Lake-S and Panther Lake-S were cancelled, perhaps for a good reason, which is the chips were very mobile focused and scaled poorly on desktop as shown by ARL-S only achieving low 5GHz and poor ring clock speed and latency.   Considering intel's current financial difficulties, I'm sure it was considered a waste of resource to design and validate desktop chips that aren't amazing on anything but power efficiency. LGA 1851 still supports 3 gens on mobile, where power efficiency matters the most.   LGA 1954 will likely support 3+ gens again, like LGA 1851, but with all the products coming to desktop.

Their upcoming E-core Xeon - Clearwater Forest - will also have base tiles for cache and interconnects made on Intel 3.  Seems flexible enough to me.

AMD,nd367aj,"Non existent.  That was a thing about a decade ago.  First of all, Intel can still produce in different nodes.  Intel had the problem that they developed both architectures and process nodes together which both had advantages and disadvantages.  You can’t just switch out the process node for an architecture, every architecture is designed for some nodes specifications. The more you focus on one node the better you can use its advantages which is one of the reasons why Intel was typically superior with their chips. But that also comes with drawbacks like Intels 10nm issues.  Intel didn’t stay with basically Kaby lake for years because they wanted to but because they couldn’t switch to ice lake without the 10nm node. And that’s the reason why Intel fell back on the desktop and servers. If you look at their roadmaps, what became Tiger lake H was supposed to come out as Ice lake in like 2018. But with Rocket Lake they backported Ice lake to 14nm which worked more or less well, depending on who you ask. Since then, Intel developed their Architectures with no specific node in mind which makes them as flexible as any fabless company.   I’d say if anything it’s a huge advantage to have your own fabs today because you can determine how much volume you want for yourself.  TSMC is basically a monopoly at that point which also means that all three, NVIDIA, AMD and Intel compete over capacities and that drives up cost.  And then there is Apple. Apple is like a first class customer of TSMC (for good reasons) and they’re the ones to decide how much they leave for the rest.",hardware,2025-09-08 14:13:42,7

I imagine TSMCs customers pay what TSMC tells them to, only constrained by the reality they can't get too crazy lest they help support Intel when the customers revolt.

I get that fabs are expensive and equipment gets “paid off” over time, but since these machines are tightly programmed and occupy massive amounts of space, wouldn’t they still represent opportunity cost if they’re just kept alive to meet obligations? * Also, on the point about products being **“tied” to a node** — could you expand on what that practically means? For example, AMD has shown flexibility in the past, like when they re-lithographed Polaris (RX 580 → RX 590 on 12nm). Would that kind of move count as being “not node tied”? * And for Intel specifically, how should we think about this? Are their designs today still bound in ways that limit shifting across nodes, or is the tile-based approach (like with iGPU/cache tiles on Intel 3 vs. cores on 18A) essentially giving them AMD-like flexibility?  Would love to hear more of your perspective on that.",hardware,2025-09-08 13:12:03,3
AMD,ndcpywc,It's a huge risk to have an in-house fab that doesn't get any outside business. 2 points of failure on design and fab side that stop the whole thing.  Intel got stagnant on the design side and then stumbled on the fab side (which causes more churn on the design side) to end up in the huge mess they are in today.,hardware,2025-09-09 23:13:22,3

That seems to be a big part of why everyone from Apple to AMD has enough trust to let TSMC handle their lithography.

AMD,nd327b2,"ADL/RPL were designed specifically for Intel 7. Intel 7 was design with ADL/RPL in mind. The two are closely related. It would require a lot of work to bring ADL/RPL to a different node.   One of the main improvements that ARL/LNL brought was internal design changes that make Intel designs in line with industry standards, using industry standard design tools vs previous designs being custom-made for specific internal nodes. This doesnt matter (directly) to the customer, but it does help Intel's engineering efforts easier going forward.    And while yes there's an opportunity cost to continuing to use Intel 7, a lot of Intel 7's cost structure was paying off the massive NRE costs due to its multi-year delay. These costs were fully depreciated H2 of last year, making Intel 7 much more cost effective.   But besides that, fabs need different types of nodes at different price points. The lithograph equipment used for Intel 7 can't just be reporposed for new nodes which use EUV. Its either use it on Intel 7 (or 16) or let it sit unused.

AMD,nd343cq,"1. That is basically what it means. As for tooling and machinery, some of them that were intended for the fab expansions that are now either cancelled or have been slowed down, have been repurposed as upgrades for existing manufacturing, so expect those to pay themselves off as well in the future. 2. Since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake, Intel's core IP, at least on the CPU side, is ""99% process node agnostic"", to quote one of the lead engineers who worked on the Lion Cove P-core that goes into Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake. What it means that they don't have to design with a specific process node in mind, and their workflows and design rules reflect that.  3. Basically the choice of node boils down to performance-power-area - which are intrinsic to the nodes themselves, and cost of wafers, time-to-market, and volume availability. The economic aspect as characterized by the latter, can sometimes be more important in determining which product uses which node.

Adding a larger cache may. Density should help there.   Memories can really benefit from a die shrink because in theory you can have the same design with minor updates just smaller. Then you can have more dies, or arrays of memory cells.   Designs that have multiple dies also have special trade offs in that area. It gets very technical.   Thermal considerations also are really part of this. Many devices are now thermally limited so whatever process reduces heat or helps extract that heat to the cooling design has an impact.

AMD,nc00dol,"The 5070 Super is rumoured to have 6% more cores, as well as 18GB GDDR7 and possibly a small clock speed bump. It should be reasonably powerful, probably matching the 9070 in raster. If that is the case, the 5070 Super could be a no-brained.  But I would guess that AMD will refresh the 9070 if Nvidia refreshes the 5070. It won't get a VRAM bump, but I could see them bumping the power limit up to the same wattage/CU as the 9070XT, which would be 266W. The 9070 is currently so power limited that simply pushing more power is a completely viable option for a refresh.  266W would enable AMD to bump the clock speeds by 300-400 Mhz, which would keep the 9070 firmly in contention with the 5070 Super, while costing AMD and their board partners nothing, since 9070s usually have 9070 XT coolers specced for 304W or higher, I think the Sapphire pulse 9070 is the only exception.  AMD would simply have to push a new BIOS and/or unlock the power limiter in Adrenalin. They could potentially even push an update in Adrenalin that swaps the vBIOS.  I'd probably still pick the 5070 Super over the 266W 9070, but it still wouldn't be a complete no-brainer, since the 5070 Super would probably be worse in raster, but better in RT. If AMD Redstone launches before the 5070 Super and gives a nice bump in ray traced (and especially path traced) titles, I think the 9070 could remain competitive.",hardware,2025-09-02 12:02:07,6

I have no idea how that's supposed to win hearts and minds. Not everyone has easy access to a Micro Center, and a $699 9070 XT is still *$100 above the original MSRP*. Worse still, I know my Micro Center at least has plenty of MSRP RTX 50-series cards; this cuts down on RDNA 4's value proposition and makes people justifying the inflated RDNA 4 price look like a bunch of bizarre and out-of-touch hypocrites.",hardware,2025-09-02 16:16:26,18

At that point it’s a useless test.  It’s not like it’s impossible to test at multiple settings, but 1) reviewers have a limited amount of time to test cards, and the time they have is only getting shorter with each review cycle, 2) medium settings aren’t standardised. Leaving out naming oddities like GTA V’s high being the medium setting, what each game decides to reduce when lowering settings down to the medium preset isn’t standard, one game might disable grass textures entirely while another will barely reduce them, and so on. If you want all games tested to be on a level playing field, it makes sense to crank all the settings to max. And 3) the whole point of a test is to push the GPUs to the max. If you drop the settings down to medium, with the high end modern cards you’re going to be limited by the CPU. If you do all your comparisons at 1080p low, then you’ll conclude that a 5080 has about the same performance as a 5090, even if that is definitely not the case.",hardware,2025-09-03 09:05:48,-1

Other places people would basically just be like ""oh nice grats"" etc. Whenever I'd find those no reddit there'd be a bunch of comments calling OP crazy, telling them the processor wouldn't last more than a few weeks etc etc. One particular comment I still remember was ""You better already have another one coming to you in the mail, because that'll be dead by this time next week.""   Well my i7-6850K that ran at 4.3GHz @ 1.425v for the past 10 years says otherwise...

AMD,nc47tse,"Here's why Intel will never make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and why their situation is different to AMD/Radeon's.  1. Intel is basically an upstart in GPU, they have zero brand presence or mindshare to build off of. AMD on the other hand has Radeon which has been around for 20+ years. In fact the only thing gamers know about Intel's GPUs is their crappy Intel HD 3000 iGPUs that couldn't run games at playable frame rates. AMD doesn't have this issue.  2. Intel is slow to compete with NVIDIA. Look at Battlemage and how we're STILL waiting on the B770, it might not even release. People are not willing to wait for your product to release, if they want to upgrade, they will upgrade to what is available. AMD also doesn't have this issue, within a month or two, AMD was competing with Blackwell.  3. Intel had only bad press with ARC's initial launch, especially because of the drivers situation. Whilst Intel has tried to improve the drivers significantly and done a great job marketing Battlemage and the product even being solid, first impressions are hard to shake and had Alchemist had a better launch, Battlemage would have sold better. AMD doesn't really have this issue, they have for one or two gens but that was long ago and not anywhere close to the disastrous driver situation Intel's had. AMD drivers for the most part, might have a small issue in a few games on release, but they actually worked and were able to play games. Some games on Alchemist wouldn't even launch or run correctly.  4. Battlemage and Alchmeist doesn't compete across the stack. For what it's worth, only competing with basically the 4060 made Battlemage a sort of pointless generation because if you bought say an RTX 3060 years ago, it's not really an upgrade to buy a B580 or B570. Furthermore, if you have a 3070 or anything else, you literally cannot upgrade to a Battlemage card because it's a downgrade in performance. Competing across the whole stack is essential to getting sales and to convince people that your product is fast. This is probably the closest problem AMD has to Intel, but with RDNA3 they tried to compete across the whole stack, they just got destroyed.",hardware,2025-09-03 01:21:43,6

It's not as simple as ""hurr durr, Intel has low prices and low margins and now they're broke"".

Well AMD is in a unique position because they have more than one product segment to fall back on. NVIDIA lives or dies by GPU, if the GPU they produce is utter garbage and GPUs fall out of favor in the wider market, their entire product portfolio is at risk and their future.

But I guess UDNA is supposed to make it so their server and business stuff contributes to gaming dev anyway by unifing them.   I do think RDNA4 could have still been selling well if AMD just produced lots of GPUs at MSRP, and maybe lower the the 9070's MSRP so it's undercutting the 5070. 9060 XT however isn't selling much it seems even though it's probably the best GPU in its price class, guess they needed to price match the 5060 with the 16GB model?

I'll concede on that point, most LLMs are probably running on server hardware, not local.   I won't concede that 1/5 is a conservative estimate for DIY to prebuilt sales though. I'd say 1/10 is realistic if you look outside the US centric reddit hardware bubble.

Maybe in the US it's 1/5, but the rest of the world is far more heavily skewed towards prebuilts.   The main point is I agree with you, AMD is never going to catch up with Nvidia in dGPU market share, anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, even in the main AMD sub this is the prevailing opinion. I would even go as far as to say AMD could make a 6090 killer next generation for $999, and their market share wouldn't increase by even a single point because there are so many consumers who mindlessly buy Nvidia or buy prebuilts/laptops which might as well be 100% Nvidia at this point.   Lowering prices did nothing for AMD in the past, and it won't change anything now. AMD will just change their wafer allocation to favor CPUs and still sell every GPU they make at current margins. Why bother when the Nvidia fans who cry for lower prices from AMD have shown time and time again that they will just wait for Nvidia to lower their prices before buying Nvidia like they always have? Lowering margin only hurts their R&D fund for the next generation.    The irony is that the real losers of this arrangement are GeForce fans, Nvidia has no incentive to produce outstanding gaming products when they're this far ahead. They can afford to lose a few generations and have their market share fall to a precipitous 90% before they start trying again, hell they can afford to lose the entire mid-range and budget markets permanently as long as they have their $2000 5090 marketing prop that only a fraction of people can afford.

I've had my cousin's law firm go out and get AI assistants and I suggested he setup an instance tailored to his firm. But the firm did some digging and found a local company who just has hundreds of AI assistants that they lease out on a subscription model and who tailor their AI assistants to a specific style of business and they customise it so it knows who the people are at the business, the business name, emails go to specific business accounts etc. It was a few thousand a year to use this AI assistant company, but the firm don't have to troubleshoot or maintain it and you get free included bi-annual performance upgrades for the hardware that's running the model, and obviously they update the model too and make tweaks after they do testing to see if they can deploy the model to their clients. In the end, it's just a secretarial replacement really, so all the model needs to do is basic stuff like note down the name and number, who the person wants to talk to and forward emails.

They put in an order of 1,000 PCs and they might buy 100 office PCs, 300 basic gamer ones, then 500 moderate gamer ones and then 100 high end gamer ones to have different tiers in their cafe. But they're all DIY rigs really, just from a local techmall shop who cranks them out and services/warranties them. I've never seen an asian netcafe buy an HP or Dell prebuilt in years and things like iBUYPOWER or Origin PC aren't really popular in Asia as the DIY prebuilt market is huge there and it's all local small shops vying for business.

I don't think so. I think they could make a 6090 killer for $999, the problem is will they supply enough to make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and considering how intent AMD is on using TSMC, I don't think that will happen. It all goes back to AMD insisting on using TSMC, they need to diversify their foundry and if they want to take marketshare it might mean going to Samsung for your dGPU gaming products and getting cheaper but lower performance silicon to undercut NVIDIA. It won't happen because AMD probably doesn't want to ruin their CPU dominance and their relationship with TSMC is too important, so they will continue with TSMC. But also because AMD is moving to UDNA for dGPU, which means they are pretty much forced to having a unified architecture on one node, which now limits their foundry options.

The end result is 3 data sources that would tell anyone with reading comprehension that there is absolutely no way for AMD to outsell NV outside of niche situations where the vendor is allocating more AMD products than NV, and even that would be a drop in the hat compared to the sheer volume NV floods the market with.

Firstly, that's one retailer in one region. It doesn't prove ANYTHING about whether more RDNA4 shipped than Blackwell. I mean we can just see from Steam HW survey and JPR numbers that NVIDIA shipped way more stock in both Q1 and Q2 than RDNA4. So whilst Microcenter may not have gotten them or even maybe NA was neglected by NVIDIA, NVIDIA still shipped more cards to people on the whole. Again... your whole point was AMD was somehow masterful by delaying their launch so they could build up stock, yet the numbers do not reflect your theory. In Europe for instance there was barely any stock as evidenced by that same video. So AMD only cared to divert stock to NA and made other regions suffer.  Secondly, I wrote a whole lot and you NEVER answered it. So I'll try again. My whole point was you were trying to say that RDNA4 was smart to delay its launch so it could stockpile units, correct? Except that you also then said that there was only 3 weeks left in the quarter so that's why the Q1 RDNA4 numbers were disappointing.  So what is it?:  1. That RDNA4 had high volume and was smart to delay so they could stockpile lots of stock?  2.

AMD simply made out like the MSRP was $599 by giving AIBs grants/kickbacks/allowances (whatever you want to call it) for selling a cheaper model at that MSRP on launch day for a limited run of units.

Be sure to right click graph and show all logical CPU cores.   You might throw Task Manager up on second display so you can see it while gaming. You might also try playing with only one display connected. Sometimes a graphics card might struggle to run two displays simultaneously in some situations when the refresh rates are dramatically different. Not sure whether that's the case here, but if you haven't tried it, you won't know for certain.  If it is somehow GPU quirk, you may solve it by running one display off the iGPU but you are using F version without iGPU, so that is not option for you. You should also check whether game is set to full screen or full screen windowed because that might have impact, too. And update your AMD drivers. All the basics.

FSR 4 is good But many games older games still use crappy fsr 2 or 3 And the DLSS counterpart would have been better.  I'd day go for a nvidia 5070ti you get better HDR coverage and older dlss is better thanolder fsr.

AMD,neh6l7k,"5800X3D is out of production pretty much, and likely the 5700X3D. So stock is getting low and demand is still the same so in that sense, prices are gonna be high. Especially the 5700X3D - you used to be able to buy for a tad under $200 from AliExpress. These days its now approaching $300 just like the 5800X3D.   If you can get either one used, for $250 or less, then it might be worth it - but very unlikely to find one that low considering people already paying nearly $300 for used samples.   IMO new or used, makes it a bad value proposition.    This is roughly the bare-minimum you'd be paying for an AM5 upgrade (keeping all other hardware you currently have), and IMO the better route to go, where you'll have a future upgrade path on AM5 with at least 1 or 2 more CPU generations before AM6 comes out (and that wont happen for several more years). You can then sell your old AM4 platform to recoup some of the money spent. Like a 3600X, RAM and Mobo would easily sell for $120-150 - your theoretical total spend for an AM5 upgrade would be roughly $300-310, right at what a 5700/5800X3D CPU would have cost you  [PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bQGKh7)  Type|Item|Price :----|:----|:---- **CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 3.9 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4r4Zxr/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-39-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100001405wof) | $184.70 @ Amazon  **Motherboard** | [ASRock B850I Lightning WiFi Mini ITX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9hqNnQ/asrock-b850i-lightning-wifi-mini-itx-am5-motherboard-b850i-lightning-wifi) | $189.99 @ Newegg  **Memory** | [Patriot Viper Venom 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4cCCmG/patriot-viper-venom-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-pvv532g600c30k) | $85.99 @ Newegg   | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |  | **Total** | **$460.68**  | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-09-16 01:24 EDT-0400 |",buildapc,2025-09-16 05:30:43,1

AMD,nehjrmg,"Sure, nearly everything *somewhat* benefits from it. But the gist of it is that CS:GO was very cache-optimised and benefitted much more from high clock rates, which were fairly limited on X3D chips before Ryzen 9 due to the thermal limitations of the chip layout.  An i9-12900K for example had 30 MB combined L2/L3 cache. That's like 50x as much as the processors that could run the original CS at 100 FPS. 96MB cache on an X3D chip is obviously superior, but not necessarily a critical advantage for games that use cache efficiently.  A lot of the industry was pretty shocked at how much of a benefit X3D cache really was, because it mostly showed how poorly optimised a lot of games were.",pcmasterrace,2025-09-16 07:36:52,15

Depends on your definition of motion clarity.       If you mean it as just the amount of image persistence based eye tracking motion blur. Then yes, you have a point as they already have 1ms persistence backlight strobbing LCDs. You can even go sub millisecond if you play around with the strobn duty cycle length, Which would already beat a 1000Hz sample and hold monitor in the race for the lowest image persistence)  If you mean motion clarity in a more encompassing way though. Then no. Because the 1000Hz monitor will have shorter stroboscopic steps on relative motions making the motion look more natural for any motion that happens relative to your eyes position.  The ideal ""retina"" refresh rate saturates each pixel described by the motion. Which for fast paced games would already easily justify 10KHz+.

AMD,neizc8p,"""Works on RDNA 2 and RTX 30"", is certainly a statement. It works, but it either has horrible ghosting or horrible performance.  RDNA 3 works well enough, to the point where it can easily replace XeSS and FSR 3 for me. WMMA could help a bit, but this leaked Int8 model is mostly proof of concept anyway.     An official release would perform and look much better, and we now have undeniable proof that FSR 4 is not at all too heavy to run on RDNA 3, or RDNA 2 technically, the only issue there is visuals, not performance.

It helps people buy the right thing and be happy with what they got...  applies for GPUs too, AMD's GPU stack is not more than 10 thick and for some they can ignore the naming eg OEM / Embedded can get a different name if it needs to get out of the consumer marketing stack.  I think Prizm would be a good brand name to reduce Radeon Pro \[AI\] R\[W\]\[WX\]xxxx naming down to something sane. under then same nomenclature. So AMD Prizm 9926 would be the top workstation GPU next year.  I think the market control groups are partly to blame for this whole issue... because a name is NOT supposed to really convey all the information, its only supposed to clearly identify a card.

AMD,neiyqqq,On RDNA 3 cards at 4K quality the difference between FSR 3 and FSR 4 is very small. 5% difference in performance. Only when doing 1080P Performance mode is it not as good. But seriously next to nobody is running 540P res upscaling anyways but its still better than native even at that low of a res.  Most people upscale at 4K and 1440P which FSR 4 has very little performance impact. So this benefit of running FSR 4 on RDNA 3 is incredible and the performance is still great. For instance I get 190 FPS running FSR 3 at Cyberpunk 1440P and with FSR 4 now im getting 180 FPS. Not that big of a difference with a massive boost in image quality.,AMD,2025-09-16 14:03:02,21

At least at the balanced preset, quality preset gives me crazy shimmering near the edges of my screen for some reason.  EDIT : works perfectly in Cyberpunk2077..

This comes to my question, On my 7800XT with optimised settings, I can run most games at high quality at 1440p and still get around 100FPS in quite a wide variety of games, I was never a fan of FSR3 because it looked kinda wacky and i never seemed to notice the performance increase   So by doing this method of FSR4 am I going to see way better performance AND the benefits of 1440p?

The internals run at much lower base power than the 9955HX, this thing is a complete fork.  Framework 32GB model is like $1100 usd for a complete system, $800 for only motherboard and the higher memory configurations are where they will take their profits from. I could see a BOM on the mainboard approaching $600+ assembled. People want the 64GB and 128GB systems and will pay market prices to get them.  Yes there is profit-taking on the higher end models, that's how companies profit off of consumers and make money to develop new products. Original Steam Deck was made to break-even at $400 usd acording to Valve, the midrange and top models added like a hundred dollars and hundred-eighty dollars of additional profit. Massive sales of the 512GB Deck gave Valve an incentive to develop the OLED refresh model which has also sold well.

Side note, I saw that Corsair has a 385 with 64GB for $1600 and I was a little tempted.  Rumors have been floating about a possible ""big Halo"" and ""little Halo"" if the line is continued. If true, little Halo should be cheaper than current stuff and big Halo could be much faster. This also depends whether we see AMD shipping as small as possibly 2nm product in their consumer division. I trust MLID even less than his net worth, but 2nm could give us a 'small' monolithic APU that's 50% faster than a 370 in both multicore and graphics performance...if you can afford it.

AMD,nen8p47,"C-states are cool I guess (pun not intended) but in my measurements there is a much bigger difference between P0 and P1 than between P1 and C2.  A near-idling Threadripper virtual machine host spends 2% of its time in P0 and 98% in C, and uses lots of power. If I forbid P0, it will spend 2% of its time in P1 and 98% in C, and use one-fourth of the power - at obviously no cost to performance because it's idling anyway.  If *that* could happen automatically, imagine the power saving across the board...  And by ""that"" I mean every wake-up from C-state should go to P1 first, and then be upgraded to P0 if it lasts long enough. What happens now is that every tiny interrupt goes to P0, and the CPU immediately goes to Precision Boost mode, ramping up voltages and clocks to maximum (especially since power budgets are overflowing) - only to go back to C0 a microsecond later.  And since there is only one voltage shared between all cores, any single core's P0 makes *all* cores enjoy the high voltage, even if they are themselves sleeping.

You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it.

While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly.

Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?
