In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.

I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work.

Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",hardware,2026-01-07 12:05:46,2

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",hardware,2026-01-08 08:30:40,1

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:41:27,-3

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.

Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.

If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power.

E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

I haven't disputed that —  The modular concept was surely ground-breaking for Intel, and urgently needed!  Though, it's kind of ironic, how Intel all by itself proved themselves liars, when it took them basically +6 years since 2017, for eventually coming up with only a mere chiplet-copycat and their first true disintegrated chiplet-esque design …  For a design, which *in their world-view*, Intel was working on their tiles-approach already since a decade, which is at least what they basically claimed when revealed by 2018 – I called that bullsh!t the moment I first heard it. Surprise, surprise, they again straight-up *lied* about it …  They most definitely did NOT have had worked on anything chiplets/tiles before, if it took them *this* long.  Just goes to show how arrogant Intel was back then, letting AMD cooking their Zen in complete silence since 2012/2013, for their later Ryzen. *Still boggles my mind, how Intel could let that happen* …  > Yes, they also benefitted a lot from both having an actually decent node and on-package memory […]  In any case, we can't really deny the fact, that Intel basically cheated on Lunar Lake using OpM, eventually creating a halo-product, which ironically was quite sought after, but yet expensive asf to manufacture.

Intel,o0spyy8,Intel has GPUs for a while they got a pretty good budget option too (just some problems with it though) called the Intel arc b580. Anyways upgrading to AM5 is not viable as its Ramageddon so ram prices are horrendous rn. I recommend checking out the 5600xt or 5800XT CPU. As for the GPU try looking for a 9060xt 8gb or 16gb it's a pretty budget option that'll do you well. If you have a budget of around 200-300 get rtx 3060.

DDR4 is also still just a more stable technology in general in my experience. Older platform boards and chips will also be cheaper than AM5, while still enabling you to build a massively overpowered system for your use case. You can also put that money saved into other things in your life, or into a more powerful GPU like a B580 or 9060XT.  For example, instead of a Ryzen 7600, I'd recommend a 5700 for about the same price. Somewhat slower individual cores, but there are more of them (you're unlikely to notice the difference with the games you play), and your board and RAM will be a lot cheaper (you can also get much better memory than that for the price with DDR4, that DDR5 you have is bottom of the barrel stuff meant for office PCs, not for gaming). A nice Gen 4 SSD isn't too expensive still, and then you can use the difference for a better GPU, or as I mentioned before, to put to use elsewhere.  Also, if you use a good board with a second x16 PCIe slot, you can use that RX480 as a Lossless Scaling frame generation card.

Your old drive is likely on its last legs, and that’s probably what’s killing your internet connection too when the OS hangs.  About the new build: Going AM5 with the 7600 is a smart move. It’s a massive jump. But since you’re buying DDR5, try to get a 6000MHz kit instead of 4800MHz. Ryzen 7000 series really needs that extra speed to shine, and 4800MHz will actually hold your CPU back more than you think.  Also, just a heads-up on the PSU: that CiT FX Pro is pretty bottom-tier. Since you’re buying a nice ROG Strix board and a modern CPU, I’d spend a bit more on a reliable power supply (like a Corsair or Seasonic) just to be safe.  Swap to that RX 480 for now—it’ll definitely beat your 1050 Ti while you save for a modern GPU.

You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check.

Sure they can add settings (and probably will) for all that, but its a 16xx with fsr will run this well enough at 1080p. When you look at most games, the reason their minimum requirements are anything more than a 10xx or 16xx is because theyre using rtx and lumen by default. Also when you look at most games recommended setting, its usually 1440p with rtx and that does require quite a bit better card. But as far as straight raster at 1080p, a 1080ti is still (rip driver support) more than capable...especially since you can run fsr3 on it if you need a fps boost.

Explanation: (I'm assuming you have a good CPU and a 144hz monitor at least.)  In terms of raw raster power, which is mostly what is required in a badly optimized game like CS2, the 9070XT shines. You will notice a consistently ""smoother"" gameplay when gaming at higher resolutions since those 1% lows will hit hard and often ingame. In my experience the frequent drops in fps are mostly what affects performance and responsiveness, and why CS2 feels sluggish and inconsistent sometimes.       If however you're gaming at 4:3 the extra VRAM will not matter as you will consistently have more than 144 fps in any scenario, which matches your monitor's refresh rate (or 240 fps if you have a good cpu and a higher refresh monitor). So 5070 and 9070XT will have the same performance at 4:3 aspect ratio.  For what it's worth, I have the 5070 and my main game is CS2, no issues whatsoever at 4:3 1280x960. I also play other games at 1440p most at Max/High settings with no issues whatsoever. The 5070 is more than enough for your needs imo.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-23 00:26:35,2

Solid cards, more vram, ray tracing has closed significantly, and linux support is night and day, I switched on nvidia recently which had some annoyances, since going 9070XT it's pretty much plug and play gaming.

Cable routing was more inconvenient.  Sold it to a friend that didn't care about all that. He got a card right after his older card died, and I was able to move onto the card I really was targeting (bought the 5070 in February).  If my purpose/wishes required a 5080 or even 5090, then I might have taken my chances long-term on relying on that 12VHPWR as a necessary evil/risk.

The extra 4GB would definitely be useful for down the road or other games and I have not had any driver issues with mine, but cannot guarantee your experience will be the same.   If you do choose Nvidia, I would suggest the ti for the extra VRAM. Understand as well that some people do still have driver issues. Due to the nature of the internet and fanboyism, I really couldn’t tell you if it is actors frequent or not. It may have to do with specific settings or configurations. But positives. The game you claim you play exclusively is optimized for Nvidia as you can see by the performance boost. Nvidia software and features are indeed more robust and proven. They are at least one generation ahead of AMD with RT, PT and upscaling tech. Don’t bother with frame generation in CS2 it adds input lag.   In short go with the one that fits your budget that you have enough confidence in. It will be in your system. Most people here will pick one brand or the other and try to say it is the only choice.

Both GPUs perform at a similar level, with variations depending on the game. In general, the 9070 XT performs slightly better, sitting in between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti. But there are specific cases in which the 9070 XT can fall below both, and others where it can rise above both.  The main actually notable advantage of the 9070 XT is the higher VRAM capacity.

Intel,o134rs5,"I could be misinformed but I think Nvidia did clean their act up in the final quarter of 2025 basically. But absolutely I think some people just glossed over that Nvidia had genuinely terrible drivers fairly consistently for the bulk of 2025. With some of the highlights being the early Blackwell drivers being unstable so the pro strat was using pre-launch drivers from iirc December 2024 that didn't support multi frame gen and maybe DLSS4 in general.  That one specific driver that would set custom fan curves to 0RPM at all temps and cooked multiple GPUs to the point of needing to be RMA'd. Which while it did get hotfixed like a full day later, that was A. still long enough we saw multiple reports of broken cards and B. they weirdly didn't force the update or heavily promote on social media or anywhere to tell people to do the update. So if you were out of loop which some people were, we still saw a few more cooked GPUs drip feed in days after it was fixed.  And the Doom the Dark Ages ""Game Ready Drivers"" that literally in the patch notes first block of text ""Documented crashes when playing Doom the Dark Ages"". The game ready drivers literally weren't game ready.  And just in general stretches of weeks to months of bad drivers consecutively that led to people basically constantly having to check in on which specific driver versions were ""safe"" to update to and when to stay on version for long periods of time before updating. It was at least half of 2025 if not three quarters of it that Nvidia had questionable drivers. Meanwhile AMD's drivers were probably the most stable they'd been in a while for the bulk of 2025, including the launch day drivers for RDNA4 were weirdly just good. They did have the advantage of the delayed RDNA4 launch but day 1 9070 and 9070XT drivers seemed to just kinda work.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-22 17:58:44,2

Then you got that annoying niggle in the back of your mind, that you messed up, and now are you going to live with it, or take a small hit and get what you actually should have.  To give one example, would be people claiming card can play 1440P/4K, when they can probably play those res at Mid setting to an acceptable FPS, or only on older games. And example would be all the people claiming a B580/9060XT 16GB does well at 1440P, when they honestly don't, unless you are playing some older games/less intensives games (Or want to play 1440p with a mix of low-high setting and get a barely stable 60 FPS on more intensives games with upscaler).  or the people who loved to claim a 4070TI was a 4K card. New builder may also get confused with benchmarkers using a 7800X3D/9800X3D to test a budget and mid tier card, not understanding the CPU is helping it's performance and a mid tier CPU will produce different results. Games also get patches which cause worse performance. You could end up watching an old benchmark, from maybe even 3-9 months ago, and get a false idea of what the GPU can do in the game you plan to mostly play. E.G: Tekken 8 released and the min GPU to play FSR 2 Ultra performance low/mid was a 1050TI, after a few patches (\~9 months) it was a 1660TI, nowadays 18+ months on, it can barely run on a 2060S at min setting. This was across the board, a 4070 was producing worse results at older settings and you had to crank down the res and/or setting. ETC ETC. There's a lot of reason why people end up slightly upgrading after they bought, even if they have done the research.  A lot of people on this sub, also don't help, people have mad copium and love to inflate the performance of their GPUs.

Maybe for half a year but eventually they’ll have to buy more Vram and prices are through the roof. High vram GPUs will be very expensive for some years now.

Intel,o11dccl,"I'll be honest mate, I agree with you. I personally only think an upgrade is worth it when you get a 20%+ performance increase. Like I've myself have battled with getting a 7800X3D when they go on sale (best sale I saw was \~$250 about 6ish months ago, was so hard not to pull the trigger), since the performance uplift from a 7600X, in CPU intensive games I play (strat games) isn't enough. Sadly I have an asrock board, pre-9XXXX release, and yeah with their issues with a 9800X3D, it isn't an option for me...  But you can sell a brand new GPU, esp a 5070, for a minor lose (ESP right now). And get a 9070XT. It isn't dropping $700+. It's dropping the difference of what you got used for your old GPU and the price of the new one. That could be $0-100, to get the GPU you wish you had got from the start. Which isn't too bad to many. AMD card also sell for cheaper used, it isn't that hard to sell a used Nvidia card and get an AMD card from the same gen, used, for almost the same price. Not long ago, I sold a 4070TI and got a Used 7900XTX and had some money to spare/made a profit. I wanted to play 4K and the 4070TI wasn't cutting it. I also got an amazing deal on a 2 week old 7900XTX, seller wanted better RT performance for Cyberpunk, and got a 9070XT.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-22 12:49:24,1
Intel,o170k9g,"Sure and I totally agree but they seem quite clear about just playing this game and I think something to highlight would be that they can save a bit of money by getting the 5070. It’s also going to be viable for other games of course it will, more than that they seem to be playing at 1080p for this particular game so I would suspect that they probably have a 1080p monitor and at that resolution you really don’t need a 9070 XT. I don’t know if CS2 is going to get updated with this, but Nvidia is also doing their reflex 2 framewarp which no one seems to know when it’s coming out, but if you are a competitive gamer, it’s probably a big deal. Honestly, I’m fascinated by the whole argument because it seems ridiculous to me to buy any of these modern midrange cards in order to play one game, but if that’s what OP wants to do, I guess it is.   They seemingly don’t show any interest in other games if they did the 9070 XT is obvious the better choice but that’s still overkill for a 1080p monitor where I do think that a 5070 is more reasonably specced with 12 gigs of VRAM going very far at that resolution and the performance being respectable.

FSR 3 was below DLSS 2, while FSR4 is somewhere between DLSS 3 and 4.  You get AMD if in your region you want a midrange card that's the best bang for buck possible, if it's priced correctly.  I disagree with the 7900 XTX being obsolete, you bought it before FSR 4 was a thing, in my opinion it still performs exactly the same. Perhaps some expected it to get a better upscaler, but even this is speculation.  Both Nvidia and AMD have been known to release new features only for their new cards.

Intel,o11ucvy,"And yet AMD has better price to performance ratio in almost all games. While I agree nvidias AI features are better, the difference is not as big as it used to be. FSR4 is vastly superior to FSR3. Antilag (2) is also a very good option to Reflex, I've actually noticed a bigger difference than I did with reflex, but it does not work properly in every game, so some tradeoff there.   FSR does have less support in new/old games, but any major new release always has FSR in my experience.   Day one driver support being better on Nvidia isn't really relevant when they still have a lot of issues with games not fully utilizing the nvidia cards, and this has a big problem this last or two year for nvidia. You simply don't need day one driver support on AMD for most games. There's been numerous games where the 50XX series has had worse performance than the 40XX series in new games even with day 1 drivers.

People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card.

Intel,nx5jal3,"Here's a dumb question that would be absolutely ridiculed if I dared to create a whole thread around it.  Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",AMD,2026-01-01 22:29:53,2

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I don't use a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but the maximum operating temperature (Tjmax) for the 7800X3D is 89°C. If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.

Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.

Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,o15856l,"Most of the conversations happened across various discord servers, so I cannot directly link them, but I also found a few posts here on reddit that seem to point towards the same direction which roughly match with the timeframe.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct\_mode\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct_mode_not_working/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr\_crashing\_on\_amd\_drivers\_after\_2451\_direct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr_crashing_on_amd_drivers_after_2451_direct/)  It's a bit odd because if you set the flag beforehand with a older version and then update to newer versions, Directmode still works fine, but if you fully remove the drivers with AMD's driver removal utility or Display Driver uninstaller (which propably deletes some cached driver file for directmode, is my guess), Directmode disables fully and can't turn on anymore at all.      As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.  I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.  But I do think that it is a fairly reproducable problem, at least on my end, it happened across two different systems.",AMD,2026-01-23 00:00:34,3
Intel,o16r403,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",AMD,2026-01-23 05:17:40,1

For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch.

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware?

Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.

(I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services.

Because it absolutely does work as intended with Arc. Arc's VRR is based on VESA's adaptive sync, like Freesync and G-sync compatible also are.  As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

Intel,lenkqpy,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,70

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.

So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

Intel,kxiah6c,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

Intel,o0l3yzt,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly. That said I guess I could just entirely disable them if I cared so much, but that's a non-trivial amount of performance to just give up.",Intel,2026-01-20 01:26:55,1

My best guess is still that they didn't realize how good RDNA4 would actually be, and perhaps thought their RDNA3 issues would take more to deal with.  The fact that the desktop lineup is basically only one GPU die, and then another GPU that's essentially just the one copy/pasted and glued together, along with this constant reuse of RDNA3.5 for mobile/APU's tells me they really didn't invest much into RDNA4's success at all.

It’s more of an independent evolution over 3 adding mobile centric perf/watt features and dropping the features that improve “scalability” for large configs.   There is also the market, where despite all of us wanting to see these “large iGPU” products, most of the mobile stuff really doesn’t care.  Krackan (8core 4WGP) vastly outsells Strix (12C 8WGP).

It's clear that from the start it was a stop-gap design for the desktop market.   They've said it's also the end of ""RDNA,"" and the next uArch will be UDNA, a ""merger of CDNA and RDNA.""   So they didn't design RDNA4 to be modular beyond 64/32cu designs. They intended UDNA to be the follow up, and I previous wagered that since it's a ground-up uArch (like RDNA was to GCN), they're building it from the ground up to be used in any applications.   The issue is UDNA is taking longer to cook. Is that intentional? Who knows. It could be that they pulled resources to push Instinct Compute development, could be that they're having Development Hell problems, could be anything. I don't doubt AI market bullshit is to blame.

TBH, I don't know what exactly possessed AMD to announce they are going to let Intel rest and recover during their nadir for the next 3 years. Only developing 1 or 2 actual iGPU's and leaving them up for the $1600+ market segment just means almost everything below that will be using Intel instead.

It’s directly targeting the parts that sped up ARM.   The main thing is the doubling of the general purpose registers to 32 different registers to keep more data on chip (probably indicative of the modern CPU’s cache increases and their importance for performance). ARM’s has pretty much supported 32 registers for years.   The other big thing is three operand instructions. So instead of doing something like “ADD A,B” which would remove the value in “A” (meaning you have to do another move operation before adding) you can do “ADD A,B,C” which would store the result in “C” without unnecessary moves. ARM has had that for years, but now APX is adding it to x86.   This is probably the next big step towards “true” 64 bit computing rather than the hybrid we had before.   This sort of thing helps power consumption as well. The lack of register pressure and moving around means we aren’t necessarily having to do that as much. You’re saving on flushes and other aspects that ARM had benefited from for years.   Basically, x86 will still be around.   Also this “beef” with x86 and ARM is so tiring.

Rather than getting marked up on every part and passing that onto the consumer (and crucially, that markup not going to their own pockets!) they build as much as they can themselves and source what they can't near cost. The result is that the only entity making real money when someone buys a Macbook is Apple, rather than AMD/Intel/Nvidia.  If *this* is what you meant by 'different cost structure', then... I would argue the other OEM's *could*. Valve worked with AMD to get a custom APU made. They tried to inhouse as much as possible, and the resultant device was profitable at the middle price point (which was still cheaper than a competitive laptop!). Valve is not larger than Dell, Lenovo, or HP. HP themselves built out Itanium, Dell and especially Lenovo operate at a scale where they can afford to build out a similar engineering effort to Apple's Rosetta 2.  I'm aware getting the M1 off the ground is very very different to the Steam Deck's custom APU; the Deck was brought up to show that it doesn't take a large company to inhouse, and Rosetta to show that you don't need to be married to x86 to profit off premium laptops.  I'm aware Apple already had a class-leading ARM core when they got the idea to greenlight the M1. Qualcomm's Oryon core is *also* very good, and the level of support and effort behind it pales in comparison. The only conclusion you can make is that Apple is *not* special, they just committed, and intended to make reasonable margin off of volume.",hardware,2026-01-27 06:44:54,1

Apple is special because no other laptop OEM is vertically integrated like them. No other OEM makes designs custom CPUs, the operating system *and* the laptop. Apple's cost structure is different because they don't have to profit off individual sub components.  Dell has to pay Microsoft for Windows, and MS needs to profit.  Dell has to buy Intel and AMD CPUs, and each of those companies needs to profit in the process.  Intel and AMD also need to design core IP that *also* can be used in server. The core has to be designed with Epyc / Xeon customers in mind. The underlying IP needs to scale from cheap mainsteam laptops, to thin and lights, to workstation laptops, desktop, gaming desktops, commodity servers, hyperscalers, and AI servers.  Apple needs to design a CPU IP for phone and laptop.  Look at something like an M4 Max: a 519mm\^2 **monolithic** N3E SoC.  The only other company making client facing monolithic dies of these sizes is Nvidia. A 5080 Desktop GPU is 378mm\^2 of N4. M4 Max is rivaling desktop 5090's in price, not to mention 8 memory channels.

Intel tried to replicate Apple with LNL by putting memory on package, and both OEMs and Intel investors complained. Moving RAM into Intel's supply channels diluted margins on LNL, and OEMs preferred to source their own memory.  Then to top it off, Intel openly bragged that all PTL chips, PTL-U, PTL-H, and PTL-H 12Xe use the same laptop motherboards.  For Apple, each CPU has its own socket. Apple has more sockets than Intel.

Premium Thin and Lights aren't really a ""niche"" - they're easily 20% of the laptop market, roughly the same as gaming laptops. The problem with STX-H is that is sucks as a premium thin and light APU. Thin and Light buyers care about the overall machine being in balance: buyers want excellent screens, good build quality and materials (preferably a metal chassis), great speakers, keyboards, nice large and responsive track pads. **A light weight, a very long battery, room temp operation. No fan noise.** If a more powerful CPU/APU compromises these, it's not worth the tradeoff.  Those final few specs are where STX-H falls apart. STX-H resembles, in many ways, a gaming laptop. Its battery is mediocre. The chassis is hot. It's designed for TDPs outside what thin-and-light buyers want. So it failed mainly for that reason. PTL-X may not hit the top performance of STX-H, but it gets close enough without making the heat and fan noise sacrifices that STX-H has.  >I'd much rather have a 5060/ti laptop (even some shitty 5070 laptops are hitting that price now) easily for what they are asking for 8050S pricing, and for 8060S  That's exactly the problem with STX-H.

Budget has been getting older CPUs for cheap, like RPL-U. New chips don't launch here.  Mainstream will get PTL-U, some Kracken, *maybe* some lower end Strix Point, and ARL-U overstock.  Premium thin-and-light is now going to be dominated on Windows by PTL-H (12Xe).  And gaming is going to see Strix Point, ARL-HX, and PTL-H (4Xe).  STX-H has no home.

I mean if you have 100% CPU utilization and 15% GPU utilization, maybe you might still see the same number of frames., but if you have 100% CPU utilization and 50% GPU utilization, switch from 1080p to 4K results in 4x the work for the GPU.

AMD,o24gxit,"16Gb is enough because most applications and games, even more recent ones, are optimised for that size. Personally, I like the headroom of 32Gb so I can run everything at once without thinking about closing things.  I do need to stress that DDR5 works at full speed (6000MT/s) when you only have 2 sticks. If ""ADATA Memory Desktop - 16GB DDR5 XPG LANCER BLADE 6000MHz"" means you are only buying 1 stick now (i.e. 1x16Gb) then at best you will be getting 3000MT/s but you can upgrade to 32Gb with a second stick later. HOWEVER, if you are buying 2x8Gbs for the full speed (across the two channels) then it is advised NOT to upgrade to 4x8Gbs for 32Gbs total - the memory controller can't handle multiple sticks and will reduce the speed to default (I think it is 5200 or something?).

Its doesn't perform any better, its 12GB is a actual trick, but yeah DLSS is nice and will net you a lot more out of any RTX GPU. There are better RTX cards, for less. Main alternative will probably be the 2070/2070Super. Without knowing your budget. On the AMD side, the 6600xt is a nice bump up in performance over the base 6600.

The first part was right. The 3060 does not have the performance to make its 12GB of Vram relevant. It was given 12GB because at the time Nvidia caught a lot of flack for what was stagnant Vram amounts in their GPUs. It was a marketing trick. And people ate it up. So much so that now a days you can get a 3070 for the same if not less than a 3060.   I have owned both those cards... in no way, shape, or form is a 3060 worth a 3070. But because ""vram"" people magically think the card will perform better. It wont... Because that second part you shoe horned in, I have yet to play a game where I have run out of 8GB vram where the vram was what held the GPU back. In benchmarks you can highlight it, but in real world play, your not going to experience that... baring new, poorly made releases that well, still fall into the doesn't run well in the first place. Vram does not equal performance.   >the newest driver update to use Dlss 4  I will refer you back to the 3070, or 20 series. Which have all that too for less, and more performance.  >meanwhile RX 6xxx series is still stuck using FSR 2 while FSR 4 is exclusive for their newest GPU entry.  No disagreement(on what I think is your point, that effectively you get more with DLSS). Though as someone who has used upscalling since 20 series, ""only FSR 2"" doesn't matter, its more performance, you adjust to to everything else in no time. Now everyone talks about how bad DLSS 1 was, I remember it, it was fine, it looked worse if you stared to long, but there is a reason it became popular(it was worth the trade).

Again, really need an idea of budget/region(market). In the US, the 2070(super) is going to carry a good $20+ premium(over 6600, around equal for 6600xt), at least. I used to own a 2070Super, I think very highly of it. I also owned a 6600xt(2 actually), I think highly of it too. If the price was effectively the same, I would buy a 2070super over a 6600xt. I also owned a 3060, there is 0 reason to buy one, you can get a 3070 for the same if not less.   Odds are the 2060Super, specifically the super(base model 2060 is notably worse). Is going to be your cheapest entry into RTX. And at its price, is okay. Again, about $20 more gets you 2070 then another $20 or so gets you 2070super, which has a bit more grunt to it.

It could be coincidental that AMD itself proclaimed 4800 DDR5 only being slightly slower, but thats the opposite  everything AMD used to do when DDR5 wasn't as expensive, even sending 8000 Kits with the boards because that would give you 1% more performance in that single usecase instead of using a good 6000 kit.  I mean 4800 kits aren't that much cheaper than most 56/6000 kits, and the usability if you change your system would be worse for that 4800 kit.  The thing that people won't do when using 4800 kits, is enabling xmp/expo.  There also have been multiple tests by outlets, which have shown how the power consumption goes up, sometimes a lot, just enabling xmp/expo, which makes sense if the voltages are way higher.

One feature I don’t think I can ever go back on is a pcie eject button that’s easily accessible even with my old xfx 6800xt merc or the new 9070xt red devil.  But yeah, it was extremely consistent. Everything worked fine with the absolute original bios, update and left hwmonitor logging. The 9700x isn’t supposed to go past 1.3v and post bios update stayed at 1.36v boosting to 1.39.

This link below is from the original megathread 1 year ago... https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/s/L6UjH7Qclg <‐ original thread  https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/s/1MfEJsIuYI <- failures by manufacturer from original thread, gave up counting after 15+ asus, about 5 giabyte and msi together, as well as being on 800 and 600 series boards, evidence contrary to your claim of being on 800 only.  True fact, the only commonality is a 9000 series cpu, true fact there is something the boards are doing to exascerbate an issue(s) with these cpu's. These are absolutely true.  I never claimed to know the problem, i never said it even was a problem. Having a weakness isnt a problem till it becomes one. Superman is still superman until he encounters kryptonite.

I hope you understand that electronics are bound to die prematurely or arrive DOA from time to time. QA problems, unknown issues, shipping, bad handling, etc... ASUS failure rate from the links you sent was pretty normal considering the popularity of the brand and sales they achieve. It started getting out of hand recently.  Just because the megathread includes non-X3D as well doesn't mean that they get fried the same way as X3D does. They are literally including them because that's how statistics works. You won't just ignore things. Whole point of including the non-X3D is to prove that X3D is the problem. The link you sent includes 165 X3D failures and 16 non-X3D failures. You shouldn't have counted either, they summed up everything near the end of the post.  It's good that you like to use ""evidence"". Now all that's left is to add the context and you'll have the objective picture.  Also, I'm sorry that you took my feelings comment personally. I didn't mean that.

AMD,o214mem,"Like you said, its pretty normal for the amount of Asus boards, and overall, it still is with the amount of boards they sell.   The second megathread has 80 x3d to 51 non x3d failures. Seems the issues is becoming worse. It went from  <10% and increased to 64% of what we have recorded.  Which is why i brought it up, the statistics are relevant and point to something within the whole line of 9xxx cpus, potentially a board manufacturer, but again the only real commonality is the 9xxx line.  If you want to ignore data thats fine, but saying to add context when we dont know the problem is a problem.   Having context implies we have the whole story to make sense of the details, at the bare minimum, having context means we can make sense of the details on its own. We cant, there is no context.  Like i said, we just dont know what the kryptonite is yet, thats the major fault. I never said there wasnt one, as qell as never said theres a problem, only that something is going on.   Again the only one seeming to base things on feelings, is yourself. The only one guessing has been you, stating its only on x3d with 800 chipset. When we have evidence its not only x3d, and not only 800 chipset. You scoffed at multiple brands, i showed you its not. You claimed asus only started this 3 weeks ago, i showed you they didnt.

So... if someone wants a lot of cores it's not that bad of price.   >why did 7950x and 5950x prices go up the moment people started doing local LLM work?  The 7950x is below MSRP too with the bare minimum of searching. The 5950x pricing varies more, but it's out of production and the last 16 core processor that can take DDR4 RAM.   >just look at how prices of mini PC's and raspberry pi's have gone up by like 2-3x after AI bubble hit to the point that you have minisforum sell mini PC's with no RAM and storage included  Everything that uses DRAM has had the costs go up. For a low price lower margin product that will inflate the price more. If it's harder to secure a stable supply of a component and the price of said component goes up a ton the economics of a $30-40 dollar SoC goes out the window.   Anything using DRAM or NAND will have the price increase or the margins worsen. That doesn't mean every phone or video game console is being used by ""AI data centers and home labs"" FYI.   >but go ahead and assume they aren't in the room, be completely unaware of how people use local LLM's and/or chatGPT to cheat in their exams  That doesn't require that much hardware, and most people doing that will be using the online GPT or Gemini or whatever. They aren't buying up stacks of RAM.",AMD,2026-01-26 20:22:34,1

I heard (and confirm it works) opening command prompt as admin, typing `winget update -all` fixes this (reboot required), and it is, then after few days driver timeouts started again, on same driver version. So what changed? Windows update have changed. Same day that timeouts started, WU installed update. Keep in mind i am on WINDOWS 10, which got opinion of being stable. I guess quality of W11 updates have spreaded into Windows 10 ESU updates.  What next? Well, increasing voltage of my UV have helped, but now i am left at just -15mv, when -40 was initially stable. Crashes (driver timeouts) started on non demanding titles, like Gates of Hell Ostfront, in totally random moments.   I'll see how the new driver will perform, but with Fedora on dual boot, i'm starting to thing about complete block of windows update at this point. What this system is becoming?

AMD,o0vjpnt,"TLDR: me too, don't know why, at least now I see I am not the only one  Edit: I also disabled MPO as one of my last changes, and that might have helped the most.  System: Intel i5 12400, 32GB ddr4 ram, 1000W psu, Asus TUF RX 9070. Nothing overclocked. Default Adrenaline settings. Main display: 1920x1080@240hz Second display: 2560x1440@60hz  I've had this issue since I first installed my rx 9070. It's been driving me crazy, being new to AMD after a long time made me think it was just me. I never had this happen before on my system, so when the only change was replacing my gtx 1060, it didn't make sense. Went through it all, replaced the PSU, clean windows installs, new and old driver reinstalls, stress testing my system(showed no issues), changing bios settings etc. Even reseated RAM and GPU, replugged cables, flipped bios on GPU. Sent multiple bug reports through adrenaline software with all data I could find.  I use Firefox and it wouldn't happen so often, but it was still frustrating when it did, so I swapped to Edge. Thought it was just a Firefox problem because it seemed like it wasn't going to timeout, until it did. Tried Chrome, happened on my first attempt. Back to Firefox now and after a recent update, v147, it looks to be stable. It could have been windows updates being helpful, though there was no description of this problem in the change logs. This occurred from driver 25.9.1 to 25.12.1. Haven't tried Chrome and Edge again since I don't use them normally, but I did it at the time to try and find a solution.  I opened a bug report on Firefox: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433)  After all of this, I think it is not a browser specific issue, though at first I thought it was. But I do think that for whatever reason, hardware accelerated programmes displaying media as it is drawn in or interacted with, on a second display, have a chance to cause a driver timeout. What made this clear was when I simply scrolled in Discord one time and it timed out, as it is also hardware accelerated.

Not with Chromium apps per-se, as I use Firefox, but I've had a hanging problem happening for the last few months which happens at pure random. Only when playing / scrubbing through video in Firefox or VLC. The hang usually happens very quickly after starting playback. I've also crashed it with Vegas Pro, which also uses the Media Engine.  But I can run video for hours, or game + play video for hours, and have absolutely no timeout. But if I lock and unlock my PC, I might get a hang 1/50 times. Or if I spend a half hour or so scrubbing through video, which is heavily stop and go. Eventually I'll crash it.  There is also a REALLY annoying VRAM memory leak I've been trying to track down. I caught Discord once using over 8GB of VRAM. It's another one of those random and intermittent things which shows up, but doesn't correspond with any GPU usage. Only uptime.  I can't crash the card with only games, or with any stress test though. Even tried OCCT with variable and fixed loads. No crash. No errors. Even tried both of the BIOSs, which were both stable for a good two years, with my card.  EDIT: Hopefully not just speaking too soon, but I remembered that my card has a problem with one of the DisplayPort outputs. If I connect just the right monitor to it, the port drives the monitor just fine, BUT... the GPU will become very unstable for whatever reason. Usually coincides with the HDMI display dropping out randomly. The other two DisplayPort ports work just fine! Might just be a board problem with the 7900XTX I have as I've heard of other reports of this happening on cards with Type C ports, with the Type C port in particular being broken.",AMD,2026-01-22 02:21:52,1

FSR4 also seems to have serious issues when dealing with overlapping transparent/translucent sources. It's like the FSR4 algorithm goes into overdrive trying to resolve the objects. Generally, fps takes a noticeable hit in places where it really shouldn't (not much going on or not technically demanding).  Microsoft needs to get it together too. We need a slimmed down gaming mode OS carveout (enters a special mode that is essentially like Xbox's OS). They need to completely rewrite most of the OS subsystems too. Not holding my breath.

It REALLY depends on the task.   You end up in a situation where there's a trade off between needing to go through the IF more for core to core communication vs needing to go all the way to system memory for memory pulls.   If you have a task where memory bandwidth and latency sensitivities are VERY high and the need for communication between threads is relatively low then the task would work better spread across two CCDs with tons of cache. One hypothetical would be background tasks (windows, etc.) on their own CCD and whatever minor spill over there is from a game also living there.  The ""burden"" that comes with CCD to CCD communication isn't THAT high.      One example that somewhat conveys this - R5 5500 vs R5 3600. The 3600, despite having 2 CCXes (read: requires that hop you mentioned when going past 3 cores worth of workload), the 3600 is generally faster since it has 2x the L3 cache - this is also in spite of the many improvements Zen 3 brings over Zen 2.",AMD,2026-01-25 00:06:12,9

Some people now can save hundreds and lose their 5% FPS in 1% lows(in CPU bottleneck tests), and in reality it will still be GPU bottleneck in most games except for online FPS or cybersport.",AMD,2026-01-23 21:47:53,8
AMD,o1bghc0,"If the application doesn't overflow cache and hit memory, or isn't notably punished for doing so, there is effectively no difference between speeds for the average fps. AMD is correct about this, games don't care much under that specific circumstance.  Whats particularly important is latency though. Most applications \*are\* punished for overflowing cache, which the 3d chips have a bit of an advantage about, and the latency hit is what kills the 1% or 0.1% lows.  AMD doesn't seem to say anything about the specs of each kit beyond the speed. Its possible both kits have relatively similar latency. A 4800 CL24 has nearly identical latency as a 6000 CL30.  Theres a techpowerup article somewhere about Zen5 memory scaling using a 9950X and even that shows less than 10% going from 6000 CL28 to 4800 CL40 so you could close that gap pretty easily with better timings.  (Alternatively just benchmark at a higher resolution, reducing the memory impact. Which they've again seemingly not specified but I'll assume 1080p.)",AMD,2026-01-23 21:57:08,3

This game is extremely sensitive to ram oc when you put all lowest to make yourself 0% gpu bound.    I ran stock jdec speeds so 4800 vs tightly tuned 6000cl28 and the average fps was 20%+. This was at 1080p.   Of course as you increase resolution, and as the average fps is lower overall plus if a game isn’t cpu fully cpu bound, the fps gain difference decreases.   For 1440p or 4k single player games sure ram mostly irrelevant. Play any competitive games at high fps? It matters, a lot.",AMD,2026-01-24 09:16:47,3

That's also true for e.g. large cities/raids in MMO's for example. If you bench standing alone in elywyn forest then even vcache does nothing because 32MB cache fits well, but if there are hundreds of players or intense combat around then 96MB vcache is overwhelmed and it spills out to RAM.

However in another scene, the one with the worst performance, vcache is boosting performance by some 80%.  It's much the same with RAM OC, it just happens at larger data sizes (so less often). Even with the same game, systems, settings, all configuration identical it's critically important where and how you benchmark.  I'd generally recommend capturing the times of worst performance AND using a geomean of a variety of scenes for some perspectives.

With additional PCIe lanes, Gorgon Halo would be later, and systems based on it more expensive. And those users who don't really need the additional PCIe lanes would complain about having to wait for so long and pay so much for something that doesn't give them a substantial benefit.  Better to add the PCIe lanes (or make them PCIe5) in Medusa Halo, which will probably bring Zen 6, RDNA 5, maybe more memory channels, etc, thus giving a visible benefit to most users, and requiring system redesigns anyway.  P.S.: Anyone feels like the ""Gorgon"" vs ""Medusa"" naming is weird? But I noticed the same in games, etc. As if Medusa was some particularly powerful Gorgon.

An iGPU laptop that draws as much power as a dGPU laptop, and requires just as much cooling and weight to go along with that cooling, but still performs below that of a dGPU laptop for games is likely the issue here.  If you want a thicker, hotter, heavier gaming laptop, then you're going to want a dGPU as the tradeoff for that packaging.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though.

Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.

Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Intel,2026-01-05 21:06:54,3

Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future. Honestly, I hope I'm wrong.",Intel,2026-01-05 18:49:13,2

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.   Overall, higher clock speeds tend to come from node maturity and refinement, not from the first use of a new manufacturing process, and I believe 5.8ghz could have been possible if intel used its own 10nm process node on ARL considering its HyperThreadingless.",Intel,2026-01-16 04:43:25,1

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result.

AMD,nh27g09,"I want elegato unedited video from start to finish i did that and on cp 2077 9800x3d matched 14700k, and it managed to beat it on horizon zero dawn, i want built in benchmark scores so everyone can easily double check the numbers, forget everything online buy the hardware and run built in benchmarks RPL i7/i9s on ddr5 7200 are equivalent to zen 4/5 x3ds much faster than non 3ds, if you can't afford it make posts asking people for thier scores in games.",Intel,2025-09-30 19:30:10,1
AMD,ngtvgdv,"It is a common knowledge at this point, that HUB, LTT and GN are working for YouTube algo, not the costumers. YT algo promotes saying AMD is king, so their reviews are exactly that (Every single thumbnail or tittle with Intel being dead or destroyed). Let's pair Intel with mediocre ram and loose timings, let's power throttle them, put on some weird power profile, turn off whatever bios setting, focus on specific benchmarks that have very little to do with real usage etc. In worst case scenario they can always say that Intel won, but it's not enough or that Amd will crush them in 6 months or so. They've been doing it for years now.   Every dude that actually verified their claims and build systems how they should be built, will tell you that GN/LTT/HUB reviews are bad and more often maliciously wrong. It's really not about being right or win some CPU wars, it's more about not being screwed by that giant YT racket that once again works for sponsors and YT bucks, not the costumers.",Intel,2025-09-29 14:03:26,6

AMD,ngjg69y,"at first I tested 4080 1080P ultra on these processors on the same DDR5 7200 im using on the 14700k but it didn't make a difference tried the 2 profiles 7200 xmp and expo CL38, so when I got the 4090 I decided to use whatever available but that wouldn't make a difference, I could use DDR4 on 14700k and still win in every game against non 3ds,   here is the test on 14700k 5600 CL46 which got me around 185FPS vs 145FPS for zen4/5 non 3ds.

AMD,ngqfmrw,"Did you get any more FPS when you tried it? I’m getting good frames without it, so I don’t think it’s worth it. Also, in SoTR, even though the 9800X3D scored higher in the benchmark, there weren’t any extra frames compared to the 14700K during actual gameplay. I tested multiple locations, and the performance was the same, the higher score on the 9800X3D came mainly from the sky section of the benchmark.",Intel,2025-09-28 22:53:49,1

Is that Comet Lake is only better at gaming when not GPU bound, when the GPU is heavily loaded like with most games running at 4K, the difference is negligible or non existent.

AMD,ngtxj1d,">It is a common knowledge at this point,  It's not an argument.  Only objective way that you have to prove that those sources are spreading misinformation, is to prove it and share it with others - do it, make your own research and share it on Reddit and YouTube, if you're really correct and your data is accurate, it will hurt public reception of these sources(HUB, LTT, GN) and will damage their credibility.  >Every dude that actually verified their claims and build systems how they should be built, will tell you that GN/LTT/HUB reviews are bad and more often maliciously wrong.   [No true Scotsman - ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)sorry dude, but your argument is logically incorrect, for pretty obvious reasons - it's unfalsifiable, it lacks evidence and it assumes the conclusion **- ""every dude"" argument is a way to sound like you have the backing of a consensus without having to provide a single piece of evidence for it -** as I said, real evidence in your case would be substantial evidence that proves that sources that you named in your comment are spreading misinformation, which shouldn't be hard to test and release in public.

AMD,nhp2exv,"What’s fake about it? What scores are you getting? Prove me wrong with score screenshots, not with fanboyism false accusations. If you’re comparing score screenshots to OBS-recorded videos, you shouldn’t, because OBS uses about 15% of GPU resources, which reduces the scores slightly. I’ve been talking about this and calling out tech sites and tech tubers on Twitter and Reddit for over a month. Do you really think they’d stay silent all this time if I were wrong? If I were faking benchmark scores, they would have publicly shown their results and shut me up for good, especially since I’ve been accusing them of corruption on a daily basis. Just yesterday Tech power up is the first techsite to block me on X for sharing my benchmark screenshot on their page, cowards, shouldn't they discuss what did i do wrong in my benchmark, then again what are they gonna say AMD paid us too much money that we need 10 years in hard work to make that much.",Intel,2025-10-04 10:27:16,1
