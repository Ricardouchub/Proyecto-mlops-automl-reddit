No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server.

That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT.

On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",hardware,2025-09-18 03:04:06,8

Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power.

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7

(there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",hardware,2025-09-18 20:16:47,5

They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm.

They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise.

For servers, an ARM server is more power efficient, and only those really legacy stuff requires X86.

Intel,nfb1vqa,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear. What I meant is that the IPC of the E-core is so much higher than Tiger Lake that it's performance at 2.6GHz is surprisingly close to desktop Tiger Lake at 5GHz.  I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",hardware,2025-09-21 04:45:15,1

This just means that the massive inefficiencies are not inherint to the CPU uArch, but are a Problem of SoC design.  7W on a single core isnt super efficient, but its far lower than 20-31W. The question is if AMD is able to strip away a large part of those ~20W overhead, but that is not contingent on questions about CPU uArches.  And thats the point of the 1 Core vs 2 Core comparison.

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part?

Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that.

I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.

We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

Intel,ng3jn52,"9060XT with 16GB of VRAM, the only budget card worth buying. Friends don't let friends buy 8GB VRAM cards in 2025.  FSR4 is a game changer and this upscaling and frame gen tech will give you added performance with improved visuals and is quite frankly the future of gaming, and will be implemented into the PS6.

Intel,nfqnj5q,The ARC card will probably be ur best bet but AMD and Nvidia have better features in general amd the 9060xt 8gb isnt that bad. It jsut kinda sucks that the lower end of hardware hasn't moved all that much in years .

Intel,nex191d,"First, your cpu is weak enough to still limit a 5060, and if you dont have a frame cap it will cause stuttering and frame drops. You're likely running into a ram limit being on 16gb as well, which again causes stuttering and frame drops, since once the ram is full it starts to use system storage as ram.    Id suggest saving some money up and going for a 9600x/7600x mobo and ram.

Intel,neyx3y3,See if your motherboard is outputting the proper pcie signal to your GPU. It might be trying to output the wrong signal. It happened to me because I had an old vertical GPU mount that had an older cable. It couldn’t handle the 4.0 signal and I manually dropped it to 3 in the bios.,buildapc,2025-09-18 22:25:02,1

Intel,nex46ca,"> turn off ReBAR and check GPU temps  Given that they're probably also using the Wraith Stealth that came with the 3600, they should probably check CPU temps as well. If the install is old enough, it's quite possible that the thermal paste has dried up and the CPU is throttling.

Intel,nh4blra,The b580 is a great tinkering machine or amazing if you're building for video editing first but for a PC gamer who has to ask I'd avoid it. It's fine if you literally only play new releases a month after release but for freshly released stuff or anything before like 2022 it can get rough.

Intel,nh5desf,"Don't listen to the other people here. As someone who owns 9070xt, 5060ti and B580, the Intel card is an amazing performer for the price and the drivers keep getting better.    I think with XeSS it is the best budget 1440p gaming card.   The only major issue is UE5 games not performing very well, but the drivers are improving.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-01 07:35:26,1

Intel,nhh299c,"If your looking for GPU prowess, I am not sure how the intel chips fair currently, But Ryzen G series have long held a strong ""APU"" lead. But, the CPU side of that chip is also lackluster, not bad, just not as good.   So it comes down to use. Personally, I would opt for the 9600x for full featured CPU, and if needed option in a GPU later if gaming. But that assumes so a use down the road.   I will say, I use a 7600 as my web suffering / streaming PC / test-bench, with occasional basic 3D modeling and software for my 3D printer. Its perfectly great. Vs a Superior Chip in the same role, I do not feel a difference. I can draw a parallel as I am currently testing a 9900x in the bench, doing the same basic stuff. It doesn't matter, your not utilizing the chips enough. You will encounter issues elsewhere first.  Thats why it again comes down to use. And that's really what you need to be clear on. Especially in regards to how much you want to spend on the system overall. a 9600x is great, but if a 7600 is a bit less, does the same, and allows you to get more storage, that could be better.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-03 01:57:58,1
Intel,nhi8u54,"Intel has better igpu but just like dedicated GPUs such as B580 it has its own issues with compatibility mostly (iirc anything DX9 and lower is not working properly and has to be routed via Vulkan, which is doable, but annoying).

Intel,nhjad3e,Why even consider Intel. Jut cause its Cheap now its more Expensive long term.   The CPU is not gonna be good for ever so you should keep upgradabilty in mind.    Intel is known for overpriced E-Waste. When you want too upgrade too a new CPU you have too also buy a new Motherboard and fully tear your System apart.  With AMD you have better Performance and AM5 will still be supported longer than 2028. So you can always Upgrade the CPU.    Another BIG reason too go AMD when you upgrade your CPU you can sell the Old one and get a Good chunk of Money back Offsetting the Cost of the new one. AMD CPUs hold their Value good cause people understand AMD is better and more people have a use for them and they dont Break.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-03 12:34:29,1
Intel,nhnt44q,8600g apus are efficient. you can sqeeze them inside small case they work well. you wont have issues.   you can also just buy mini pc with something like Ryzen 7845HS many come barebone without ram and ssd around $300 from china. these will be better option.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-04 03:27:02,1

Intel,nibsy6k,Ah damn alright I'll stick to 1440p with upscaling then.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 22:41:27,2
Intel,nib1ngx,I kind of get it but I still don’t see why you wouldn’t just do DLSS quality on your 4k monitor. What’s the refresh rate on it?,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 20:16:51,2
Intel,nie1dyt,Of course.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 08:27:53,1
Intel,nih9ib0,I don't get it,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 19:58:49,1
Intel,niaqhrz,pretty sure its the average frame rate.   I have a 9070xt (not 100% sure if I upgraded from the 5600 to the 5700x3d before or after the beta) and played at 1440p everything high or max settings and was getting at least 100 fps,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 19:20:38,30
Intel,niaqsvn,Most likely average fps throughout a match. Campaign will probably run a bit better depending on level and scenario since more players = higher cpu usage. 1% lows I think I've never seen before on a settings sheet and only seen it in benchmarks.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 19:22:12,1
Intel,niardym,"1% high would be an utterly useless thing to measure. 1% lows at least measure how much stutter there is, but 1% high measures what exactly? That 1% in the benchmark run that has mostly the skybox in it?",pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 19:25:09,1
Intel,nidg7jd,i doubt that. You dont spend years on a game and have no clue how it performs.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 05:01:04,1

Intel,nibcxoh,"Yeah probably,damn i wish i had more than 16GB of RAM lmao, it's on the list of the upgrades bringing the total to 32 GB.  Still,i'm super impressed at how smooth the game ran with that amount of RAM considering that less realistic games run at a fraction of the framerate with less graphical settings",pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 21:12:55,3
Intel,nicsx74,3060ti + Ryzen 5 3600 and my performance was better after turning settings up and putting more load on GPU. Probably because my CPU is bottleneck.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 02:13:12,1

Intel,nihrb8o,Which is the problem with 6 core CPUs in this game. Dropping everything to low and lowering resolution did nothing until I used the file. CPU was pegged at 100%. I'm still CPU bottlenecked but it's much more manageable and not limiting me as much.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 21:26:06,1
Intel,nieemiu,"There was a significant leap on 40 series.  The 5070 rn is like a 4070 Ti (non super) which performs like a 3080 ti - 3090. 3090 Ti is still stronger, btw 5070 and 5070 ti, some cases even better.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 10:39:03,1

Intel,nibnode,With frame gen during the beta I was getting pretty steady 140-165fps with almost everything at ultra and dlss quality at 1440p. This was on an 11700k and a 4070ti so I’m hoping performance will be similar… this chart makes it seem like it will not.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 22:10:49,6

Intel,nigec67,"I meant that they don't how it performs on every cenario (where in the game, where looking to in the game, all the GPUs, all the CPUs, etc).  For example, in  Fallout4, if you look to the ground outside the main city you will get a very good FPS, but if you look to too many buildings inside the main city, you might get half what you had outside.  Some games, even if you follow the same steps, you might get different results on FPS due to random objects.  Theses tests give little information if you do them while developing the game, because future changes can throw away all tests done in a previous build, then new tests must be made with many combinations of GPU, CPU, SSD, RAM, ingame configurations, etc. Also, doing development all the configurations that make Medium and Highmight change, Low and Ultra usually mean lowest and highest, which **usually** doesn't change.  Given that few games get released with minimal bugs, I really doubt they fully test it before launch.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 17:24:29,1
Intel,nihwz1b,"I KNOW RIGHT! I've played BF1, BF5, BF2042, and BF4 and 3 on my PS4, so I've gotten used to the great optimization that Battlefield always seems to deliver, and so I was also expecting the same for BF6, and that they most certainly did deliver on, though it still impressed me for two reasons; For one, I felt like the volumetrics were a huge step up from previous titles and you'd think that it would affect the performance exactly like how you mentioned in this comment, yet it didn't! Secondly, I had become so used to the awful performance being delivered from modern titles nowadays, coupled with my very low expectations before the beta, that despite the fact that Battlefield always delivered with great optimization, I genuinely thought that this game would be the exception, but no! So yeah, I'm very pleased with this game and I can't wait for it to release!     If what I said previously does work when the time comes, I'm glad to have helped!",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 21:56:29,1

Intel,nihdsla,I know what you mean. I returned Borderlands 4 after trying it. I was getting a *rough* 60 using medium/high settings (from Hardware Unboxed optimized recommendations) with FSR balanced at 4K. But emphasis on *rough* since the 1% lows were around 30-40 even when just walking through the world.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 20:17:31,1

With DLSSQ and FrameGen I'm at 140FPS or more. All in WQHD. Framegen also reduces (yes, you read that right) Latency by a big chunk because Reflex is activated with it. An option to disable Framegen and activate Reflex would be cool, tho. I modded it in with SpecialK, but not offering an Option in the settings is a huge miss from the Devs. That game has huge Latency Spikes (up to 100MS) and you can feel it drastically. So Reflex is a must even without FrameGen.  I settled to use FrameGen with a Reshade called Lillium HDR Reshade witch offers a Reshade to Sharpen the Game, so I don't have many troubles with ghosting from Framegen. I also installed a Mod Manager named UltraModManager that greatly buffs visuals and offers a fix for black floors (Color grading is a little bit off in games from those Devs). Right now I play with Game with 120FPS+ with DLSS Q and Framegen enabled but without much noticeable Ghosting and with decent Latency and HW Lumen enabled. If you like to Fiddle with UE and don't hesitate to install Mods, it's a great Game. The ""Basic"" experience is meh, tho. Not because of the lack of FPS, but because of that huge Latency thing.

There were no AI tools to help smooth the pain.   I know all the arguments for DLSS / FG / VRR etc. so not trying to start a word-war here, just saying that buying a 5070 today is not what buying a GTX970 or 2070 was back in the golden days ;)  If one has to still think about sliders in games with a $2000 GPU, we are not doing something right.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-06 19:33:51,4

If Intel actually managed to execute and follow their initial roadmap and release Alchemist GPUs during the COVID pandemic we'd probably be looking at a very different Intel GPU division but here we are now.,pcmasterrace,2025-09-18 22:37:35,7
Intel,nezo4ea,I don’t necessarily think that it’s that dramatic. The Arc GPUs are aimed at a market that Nvidia no longer competes in (the budget GPU space).

(and even if they did the flavor of DX used by PC titles is not compatible with apples GPUs).  And while apple could support VK, remember VK is not HW agnostic, a PC VK backend (the small number to titles that have these) will be written expliclty to target AMD/NV GPUs and would require rather large changes to run well (or even at all) on a VK driver for apples GPUs on macOS.    The work needed to add a metal backend to a modern engine (if it does not already have one... most do) is not that large.  All modern engines are written to be mutli backend enabled.  The amount of a games engine that directly calls a graphics apis is intently tiny since we need this to run very fast within the Redner loop, idealizing keeping the entire loop within L1 Cpu cache.     Adding metal support to an engine is not were the work is.  All the other changes, user input, file system, Audio, networking, digital signatures, color spaces (Mac users expect proper HDR)... this is all way more work than adding metal.    (also most engines already have metal backends).     from a graphics side of things there is a LOT of work but this work is API agnostic and relates to making changes to target the HW (you would need to do this regardless of API as all the modern apis want to remove runtime overhead of the driver reputedly making these optimizations over and over again on each frame).",pcmasterrace,2025-09-20 10:09:11,1

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",AMD,2024-08-02 03:44:51,1
Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",AMD,2024-10-30 18:32:02,1
Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-5

If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",AMD,2023-10-30 20:36:21,14

Intel,k7aqfmz,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.

In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",AMD,2023-11-01 05:55:17,1

And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better.

That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode.

So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT.

Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

So I would expect Intel to respond to that, right? It's not like we have to guess what is what is big and what is coming. We know and what's coming is more AI and more graphical experiences.  With this being said, I hope that means that the Nvidia/Intel deal means that the ARC division is not going away any time soon.",Intel,2025-10-08 21:00:02,3
Intel,nij93k3,I found it interesting that he specifically mentions improvements in performance per area for Xe3. A big complaint of Xe2 is that the die size is noticeably larger than a similar performance GPU from AMD or Nvidia.

Intel,nh7wmoo,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Intel,2025-10-01 17:23:05,1

Intel,nh5omi0,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Intel,2025-10-01 09:32:35,4
Intel,nh5zjzc,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.

Intel,nh2x17x,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render.

Intel,nh293fj,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios.

Intel,nfx7rp7,"> I mean the price had skyrocketed as well  This is actually not true. As someone who wanted to buy a b580 for a rly long time but only for msrp, the card took like almost 9 months to hit msrp. I was watching it for a while and I did not feel like paying above msrp for it. Like until a few weeks ago all the ones available were like 50+ dollars over msrp. Now you can actually buy one for msrp at multiple places which is a good thing.   > How much of the problem would you say has been solved since release  The overhead problem hasn't been solved. I don't even think intel can fix it or has any interest in fixing it as they knew about it since december of last year and nothing has come out to try fix it. How big a problem is really dependant on what games you wanna play. It can only be like a 5% overhead issue which still puts it faster than the 4060 and 7600 but theres some games where it's like 20% or more where you have to have a very strong cpu to not see the overhead.  Do some research on the games you play and that will tell u whether to buy a b580 or a 9060 xt. I ended up going with a 9060 xt even though I would have preferred a b580 just cause amd was able to supply msrp copies around launch and i didn't feel like waiting any longer.",Intel,2025-09-24 10:12:04,13

What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

AMD,ni2qner,"Ok, here's how to think about the recent Nvidia and AMD deals with openAI:  Nvidia deal: basically Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for a portion of the GPU purchases with stock.  It works like this: for every $10B of Nvidia GPU that openAi buys, Nvidia invests something like $6B (iirc) back in openAI, buying their stock.  This means effectively $4B of the purchase is in cash and $6B is in stock.  AMD deal: openAI buys full price but gets AMD stock as rebate.  The deal is almost like an employee compensation plan.  Every GPU purchased earns openai a stock award.  The Nvidia deal works for openai because it's valuation rich but cash poor and works for Nvidia because it has a large margin on its chips and get to invest in a way that juices its own sales.  The AMD deal works for AMD because their stock price is relatively low and they need to jump start purchases of their ai hardware.  It works for openai because they get a rebate effectively and a Nvidia alternative to diversify supply risk.  Both deals are actually pretty safe because they are pay as you go with relatively small actual upfront commitments and no leverage involved.  Basically companies giving each other coupons.",hardware,2025-10-06 14:39:35,30

AMD,ni4qjhy,"Nvidia didn't actually throw $100B at OpenAI.  It's basically a invest as you go deal with a ceiling of $100B.  Basically, for every $1 of GPU purchase by OpenAI, Nvidia buys $0.6 of stock from OpenAI, so in essence Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for 60% of its purchase in stock and the rest in cash.  Recall that Nvidia's gross margin on their GPUs are about 70% and even their net profit margin is about 55%  So even on a cash basis Nvidia is still revenue positive on the GPUs it will sell to open ai, while it gets rewarded handsomely in openAI stock.  If the deals DO reach the announced $100B value, it will have meant that openAi would have found enough revenue to meet its most optimistic projections, in which case NVIDIA's stock purchase would be worth a fortune.  From both company's perspective this is a win win.  Where's the downside?  The downside is the extra planned production capacity, which is being shouldered by Nvidia and TSMC.  TSMC is actually carrying significant counterparty risk in these deals because both the Nvidia and the AMD deals translate to larger planned buys that may not materialize.  It's TSMC that has to build the physical factories to make all the chips, and they have to do so ahead of projected demand.  That mean they have to treat these large projected buy numbers as ""real"" or risk failing their customers.  On the other hand they know that the upper range of these numbers have got to be BS, but where to place their bets?  TSMC is probably actually happy for Intel foundry and Samsung to soak up some of the projected demand so they are not alone in carrying the risk of over building manufacturing capacity.",hardware,2025-10-06 20:30:01,15

A lot of times you spend as much time verifying that it's true as time saved from getting the quick response in the first place.

A stock price crash can kill a company if the company needs the investor money to invest in something to scale up production to profitable levels (nvidia is already mostly at scale so this isn't a problem), if the company is already going through a massive debt crisis/restructuring, or whatever other scenario that their revenue can't cover short term cash flow. Of course this can still wipe out irresponsible investors, but that's a different story. Hell even in the extreme unrealistic case where ai 100% dies, I think nvidia has a good chance of surviving, and even outside that, their IP and market presence is large enough that in the worst case they will be bought out, and even if that somehow fails, they're likely to be bailed out to retain any sensitive IP. If Chrysler can survive 2008, nvidia can survive the ai bubble popping  And investing in a company to buy your product isn't as dumb as it sounds at first (though I think the scale involved is a bit ridiculous.) Nvidia isnt just investing in openai to buy their products directly, they're investing in openai to scale up open ai into being a mature, reliable, and dependent Nvidia customer.

This is exactly how aws managed to become big so fast, they invested in random companies that weren't profitable so that they could scale up and become profitable companies that were dependent on aws, EVs do this with battery companies and vice versa, this is how most early industrial companies like JP Morgan grew, this is how telecom grew, dot com, etc. Now it pretty much guarantees a bubble, or rather it only makes sense in a bubble, since the goal is to have the people you invested in mature fast enough to survive the bubble popping and then remain dependent on you.

That's not the worst case, this dilutes AMD shares, gives OpenAI stake in the company, and those 160 million shares are guaranteed to either be sold or cashed out at a future date when OpenAI suddenly needs funds. Dumping that many shares will guarantee a hit to the future stock price, or if they are transferred in full to a third party via sale/acquisition of OpenAI then that's yet another potential risk for AMD. Before this deal the largest shareholder was only around 3-4%, so if someone wanted to make a future play on a hostile takeover buying that 10% stake from OpenAI after the company implodes would be the first order of business.

So in your scenario what's your time horizon?  Lisa Su knows what her time horizon is for AMD stock, it's whenever her large institutional investors need to close books for the year.  She also knows the market's reference standard.  It's Nvidia stock.",hardware,2025-10-08 07:27:03,1

That's the point of retirement savings for 95% of Americans who make <$200,000 annually; You chunk it out, in small increments, over a long period of time, and let the compounding take effect.   Say they started withholding $5,000/year for their 401k 20 years ago. Factor in the 3% match, that's $5,150/year. After 20 years, assuming 7% returns (hyper conservative over the last 20 years), with just annual $5,150 contributions, they'd have $238k right now.  Now, let's use the actual market data. Same parameters as above, but with a ~16% returns (thats the avg over the last 20 years for VTI), they'd have $811k right now. One can realistically live off of that for 40 years if you live very very frugally, combined with SS.  You throw in an additional 1-2k annually and this is even more of a nest egg.

Being ""fair"" is not in the sense that you were putting forth where a company's stock could be deemed fairly valued based on fundamentals compared to some absolute standard or some historical average or market average.  Now you have dragged in a huge number of hidden assumptions and subjective taste, and wedded yourself by taste to a philosophy of valuation that fits poorly with the market's actual dynamical behavior.  All of this leads to confusing analysis that tends to bury rather than surface actionable insights.  Investing based on ""fundamentals"" is actually hugely complicated.  You use a simple seeming set of analyses but all of the above complexity is shoved into candidate sector selection, company selection and trade execution behaviors based on inference centered human neural network training (ie taste and intuition) combined with complex logic.    Only very few people can do that in a way that beats the market consistently after a lifetime of experience.

AMD,nhxc9gc,"The name was intentionally misleading.  AMD has one actual chipset for AM5, Promontory 21. All the labels are marketing names for various configurations of that chip on a board.  Each P21 has 12x PCIe lanes, some USB3 hosts, and SATA ports hanging off it (among other more minor things). Every difference between the marketing names other than that comes down to certification for the most part, like if they officially say the chipset lanes support PCIe 5, or if they require the motherboard maker to support USB4.  B650, B650E, B850, B850E, and critically, X870, use one of these chips.   X670, X670E, and X870E use two of these chips.  In effect, this means that X670 *vanilla* gives you 8x more downstream chipset PCIe lanes (4 are used to connect the two PROM21 chips), more USB ports and more SATA ports, than its more expensive successor in X870.

Percentage based performance charts for upscalers is unfortunately a very bad way of understanding what kind of performance uplift to expect. But because a YT audience won't really understand game performance in terms of frametimes and only in terms of framerates, I can understand why HUB chose to explain performance the way they did, even if I don't like it personally.  I could explain it here, but I suck at writing out stuff like this in a way that makes sense. So instead I'll push you over to [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nvibgd/explaining_some_misconceptions_about_the_cost_of/). Read this thread for a full understanding, but for a short breakdown, this bit is the most important part:  > Imagine I have Game A, B and C which can render natively at 720p at 30, 60 and 120FPS respectively and upscaling to 1440p with FSR3 and FSR4. For FSR3 on the 6600 the 1440p upscale cost is usually ~1.2ms, while for FSR4 it's ~4.3ms. This is how switching from FSR3 to FSR4 would impact the performance profile in each game:  > Game A (30FPS = ~33ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~33ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 34.2ms = 29.2FPS  >     FSR4: ~33ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 37.3ms = 26.8FPS  > Game B (60FPS = ~16ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~16ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 17.2ms = 58.1FPS  >     FSR4: ~16ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 20.3ms = 49.3FPS  > Game C (120FPS = ~8ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~8ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 9.2ms = 108FPS  >     FSR4: ~8ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 12.3ms = 81.3FPS  > On game A FSR4 gets 91.7% the performance of FSR3, on game B it gets 84% the performance of FSR3 and on game C it gets 75% the performance of FSR3.  This should explain that as your input framerate gets lower, the output framerate will be closer between FSR3 and FSR4. So actually FSR4 is actually more useful when you're trying to hit 60-70fps than it would be if you're already well beyond that.",hardware,2025-10-02 13:58:25,24

That can take a game rendering at say 20fps (50ms) down to 30fps (33ms), then you would add the render cost of FSR3/4 on top.   The numbers they explain in that post basically just forgot the first step: the performance gain from rendering at a lower resolution natively. But it holds true for the bit afterwards: adding the compute cost of the upscaling method to the frametime cost of rendering at your new rendering resolution. It doesn't actually change the numbers much in the end - your upscaling cost is entirely dependent on the compute capabilities of the GPU in question so regardless if what your framerate is before upscaling, it's going to be a fixed cost on top at any given resolution (AKA FSR4 cost in terms of frametime will be the same on the same GPU at the same resolution in all cases - even across games you should only see minor differences).",hardware,2025-10-02 14:11:46,8

Granted with Gigabyte frying chips and ASUS frying chips plus their own motherboards honorably committing seppuku for the chipacide afterwards, there was a lot going on.  I built a system a month after AM5 launched with a 7700X and ASRock B650E Riptide Wifi motherboard. Out of the gate VSOC defaulted to 1.25v but was reported at 1.288v by ZenTimings 1.29. VDD Misc was 1.3v, and CLDO was 1.10. Currently VDD Misc defaults to 1.1v, CLDO defaults to 0.95v even when setting 6000 1:1, and now VSOC shows as red if set above even 1.23v. VSOC also now actually delivers the voltage it's set to without running above it, so either ZenTimings changed how it measures or ASRock changed its LLC setting for the VSOC rail.  Will have to finish the video later but I do wonder if Steve is factoring in the ever-mercurial voltage defaults all the vendors were using. I know ASRock personally changed and tweaked every single voltage knob & paired LLC knob that existed and was constantly changing them for the first year, and still tweaking them by year two to try and lock down the memory headaches users were having. But some of those default voltages were still nuts even when the X3D chips first launched.

Back from the 7800X3D era I remember a Buildzoid video that mentions one of the three RAM voltages that gets changed by EXPO presets will affect power plane levels within part of the IO die, and there's one voltage plane that shouldn't get too high relative to another lest it cause problems.

AMD,nh9aaga,"From someone smarter then me:   NVIDIA DMM and AMD DGF are fundamentally different approaches to the same problem. DMM works by taking the original surface and then radically reducing its detail, so in the end it consists of fewer triangles, while storing the surface information in the form of a displacement map. This way, the BVH acceleration structure can remain simple, since only a fraction of the surface's real detail needs to be taken into account for the actual calculations. DGF, on the other hand, is a scalable, lossy compression method for meshlets, and unlike DMM, it actually represents the geometry instead of only reproducing it through a displacement map. The result is similar, and the BVH acceleration structure can remain relatively simple. Since both methods are lossy compression techniques, there will be some quality degradation, but the benefits gained from compression are significantly greater than the loss in quality.  The principle is therefore similar, but the advantages and disadvantages lie in different places. DMM compresses much more effectively, so in theory the gain is greater, but because of the required surface preprocessing it imposes a significant overhead on the CPU, and it is also not compatible with the actual geometry used in today's games, since the content has to be tailored specifically for DMM. DGF compresses less effectively, so in theory the gain is smaller, but it is compatible with all kinds of geometry, and it does not impose any significant overhead on the CPU either.  Because DMM proved so impractical that no developer was willing to adopt it, NVIDIA decided to discontinue the technology in the RTX 50 series, meaning it is unlikely to ever see use in practice.  Since DMM is practically unusable, NVIDIA introduced Mega Geometry as its replacement, which primarily works by clustering triangles rather than manipulating the surface itself. This addresses DMM's compatibility issues and imposes relatively low additional overhead on the CPU, but it does not perform actual geometric compression, meaning its memory requirements are extremely high compared to both DMM and DGF.  A simple comparison of the situation:  DMM: very limited surface compatibility, high CPU overhead, extremely low memory usage  Mega Geometry: full surface compatibility, moderate CPU overhead, very high memory usage  DGF: full surface compatibility, low CPU overhead, low memory usage",hardware,2025-10-01 21:20:13,2
AMD,ngmjll4,"Yes all cards technically support it but they mean support for HW based decompression. From earlier post from February: *""Dense Geometry Format (DGF) is a block-based geometry compression technology developed by AMD, which will be directly supported by future GPU architectures""*  If I were to guess RDNA 5 based cards and the next gen consoles will have a decompression engine inside each ray accelerator similar to how NVIDIA added a DMM accelerator with 40 series.   This isn't just some baseless speculation there's actually a patent for this in case someone is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250131640A1/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20250131640A1/en)  This quote is interesting as well:   *""Quantization took less than 1% of the overall frame time, which means this process will not majorly affect rendering times in an animation pipeline. Likewise, animating the position data (Animation) has an almost insignificant contribution to the frametime. BVH Build and Ray Trace dominate the image computation.""*  **TL;DR:** Animating geometry has an insignificant impact on the ray tracing ms cost. ~~IIRC rn animated geometry is usually not implemented in RT games due to BVH overhead concerns.~~ *It's about rebuilds and inefficient BVH management rn not animated geometry overhead.

AMD,nh9aii2,"One more point: while DMM and DGF target similar problem areas and therefore cannot really be used alongside each other, DGF and Mega Geometry are not direct replacements and these can actually complement each other, as they approach the situation differently.   A Mega Geometry-like solution can works on DGF surfaces, so it is likely that both will eventually be utilized together, as they work very well side by side. It is very easy to implement a Mega Geometry-like solution in hardware, while DGF can be emulated via compute shaders, which is important, because a GDF-like decompression engine can be extremely complex in hardware, so it will take a while for Intel and NVIDIA to implement it.",hardware,2025-10-01 21:21:22,2

Thanks for sharign and can you please space out the first comment similar to JoeMan's comment?

Probably more features as well but we'll see.",hardware,2025-10-02 17:38:34,2
AMD,ngoqy41,"As I understand it DGF is a technique for compressing geometry to reduce memory usage and at least in the first paper, reduces performance when tracing. The memory reduction is like a factor of 6x but tracing can be slowed by like 2x. This site is showing that you can slot animation into DGF cheaply (i.e. change the vertex positions and rebuild the blocks). In reality the cost of animating geometry with RT had little to do with the cost of transforming the vertices, GPUs are very good at that.  Touching any part of geometry means you need to rebuild the BVH or you'll be missing movement in the ray traced representation. DGF doesn't address this (its implementation isn't strictly connected to BVHs, although the meshlet blocks can be used as leaves in the structure). So it is expected that BVHs and ray tracing would remain the expensive part since the same stuff happens with or without DGF. Like you stated, the cost of this process is why it's not usually implemented in RT games - the less geometry you change, the more you can delay rebuilding or do partial updates instead. This article is just showing that DGF holds for dense animating geometry too",hardware,2025-09-28 17:53:13,7

AMD,ngp970p,"Thanks for providing additional context from earlier blogpost and papers. Ms overhead is an issue for sure which is why AMD is opting for HW accel in RDNA 5.  One thing for certain is that AMD NEEDS their own RTX Mega Geometry competitor. Especially PTLAS otherwise like you said if they animate just one asset then nonstop BVH rebuilds.   Intel already unveiled Micro-mesh CBLAS in a paper over 2 years ago, and during Summer they unveiled PTLAS support. Meanwhile RTX Mega Geometry implemented in UE5, proprietary engines etc.... and as usual where's AMD. Maybe when DXR 1.3 arrives AMD will bother to do a proper implementation.",hardware,2025-09-28 19:19:39,2
AMD,ngphnue,"Absolutely. DGF with HW acceleration could be great if it could make decompression free, then they could reap memory benefits (if it was adopted, it requires baking to use). RTX Mega Geometry existing kills off any excitement for DGF for me, DGF seems like AMDs answer to DMMs which were lower quality but 3x better at compressing and faster to decompress. Meanwhile DMM acceleration has been killed off from 50 series in favor of Mega Geometry which handles every case DGF wants to: granular BVH, clusters, partial rebuilds, memory reduction. Which also works on earlier series...  Nanite seems to have proven to everyone clusters are the next step in LOD management. Intel Micro mesh, NVIDIA CLAS. I was unaware of PTLAS (thank you for inspiring a deep dive!) but you are right, Intel and NVIDIA again. Shocking AMD do not have any response to either feature (yet??). I guess Project Redstone is probably their focus right now? They absolutely need a response to Mega Geometry!  Edit: I suppose if they can get HW accel building to be fast enough, DGF leaf node BVH could achieve some of the same benefits since its effectively a cluster BVH (which AMD tested by using primitives, maybe their next target to implement in hardware?). I'm not entirely convinced where DGF is going without more insight into the hardware/software limitations",hardware,2025-09-28 19:59:55,3
AMD,ngq17lp,"As usual NVIDIA keeps moving the goalpost and AMD responding to prev gen one (DMM) gen too late (RTX MG).   Like you said Mesh shading and continuous LOD isn't going anywhere. So it seems. Catching up to CUDA, DLSS and porting FSR4 to PS5 Pro prob takes all their SW side ressources beyond graphics R&D :( You're welcome.    Well look at their pathetic responses to DXR 1.2 and the recent Advanced Shader delivery on the DirectX blog. AMD really needs to up their SW and HW game and I doubt we'll hear a single word on CBLAS + PTLAS SDK from AMD until RDNA 5 gets launched, but hope I'm wrong.   The Vulkan Github documentation for MG is a treasure trove for anyone interested. Look to the left section for documents ending with .md, truly great stuff! [https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk\_lod\_clusters/blob/main/docs/blas\_sharing.md](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_lod_clusters/blob/main/docs/blas_sharing.md)  And it's not like they don't have the talent to push things hard, Holger Gruens and Carsten Benthin former Intel, Matthäus Chajdas and many others. There's just seemingly a lack of will at AMD to really push things except for their GPU workgraphs push which does deserve huge applause.  We'll see, but that would be the next logical step similar to what NVIDIA does in 50 series (new ray/tri engine). Yeah more info needed to be disclosed by AMD but reading the Github documentation for MG this isn't close to being enough. AMD really needs to plan based on DGF not existing, because there's no guarantees devs will even bother to use it.    Still Dense geo format does have interesting use cases beyond BVH management, but that's speculative patent based derived analysis (Look for the KeplerL2 patents shared in the NeoGAF forums a while back: [https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/page-12#post-270687172](https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/page-12#post-270687172)   Not confirmed in any way by AMD. But it looks ideal for a parallel wide INT-based prefiltering testing setup to cull triangles before expensive floating point tests but what do I know. Either way interesting stuff.",hardware,2025-09-28 21:35:48,3
AMD,ngqaubu,"Very interesting, AMD are taking advantage of DGF for rapid and wide culling to speed up intersection testing. This could indeed be their way of hardware accelerating cluster intersections, although I'm intrigued what the practical uplift this gives nor how they address building new clusters. I have no idea what NVIDIA did to achieve the same on prior gens.  I also had no idea NV MG BLAS info was posted. It's conceptually simple but it's a very smart intuition that since RT with a good accelerator is less tri constrained, you can just reuse high poly BLAS and forego swapping LODs. I'm guessing Ray Reconstruction is very useful here to cut back on any extreme aliasing. Very curious now to see how they managed to optimize animated geometry, maybe heavy partitioning with lazy BLAS refit or just brute force rebuilds. Regardless NVIDIA is obviously far ahead with a more united stack of solutions.  Despite AMDs talent I find it more impressive that Intel manage to keep up with graphics developments much quickly. XeSS, ExtraSS, cluster and partition acceleration structures, etc. Their media encoders have also remained competitive. AMDs strategy is a bit confusing to me especially with how they're dragging out RDNA3.5 in new products. I hope UDNA impresses.  Thank you for the reading material, you are very well informed 😁",hardware,2025-09-28 22:26:59,5
AMD,ngsk7bl,"Number one   Yeah so it seems at based on the AMD patents, but it's not just DGF patents, they also have a fallback method called prefiltering nodes, which is probably very similar to how the RTX Mega geometry clusters work on 50 series, but I could be wrong and like you said NVIDIA doesn't exactly spill the beans on architectural intricacies. While DGF is superior (compression and memory accesses characteristics) this fallback is also made for rapid and wide culling like you said.  Apparently the idea is to precompute a set of quantized BVH data matching the full precision data. It can even be leveraged for ray/box intersections but it seems like triangles will benefit the most.   From what I can read INT operations are multiple times more ressource efficient than FP. That is all PPA characteristics, power, performance at area. From what I can read online it's anywhere from 3-5X, might be wrong, but the patents directly mention ""multiple times more"" so it's at least 3x. In effect AMD can probably shrink the current FP pipeline down, given it'll only be used for inconclusive final tests, and at little cost to die area implement a very wide parallel intersection tester unit that eats ray/tri intersection tests for breakfast.      Another benefit of DGF is that you can include pretty much all the relevant data within one node, so you do just one memory access for the entire block and you can begin doing RT. For example opacity micro maps data has a header within the DGF block. Still no info on subdivisions + tesselations but that's no doubt coming as well given MG supports it, or it'll be included in an accompanying template similar to MG. They also talk about rays coalesced against the same node in the patents, where you mass test rays at once before removing the DGF data, but IDK if that's how things are done today already.  Github FTW! Yeah me to as usual NVIDIA holding their cards close :/ I'm pretty sure the animations rely heavily on subdivisions and tesselation based on this: [https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk\_animated\_clusters](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_animated_clusters) This simplifies the underlying geometry and should massively speed up rebuilds and avoid them entirely.  For sure, NVIDIA as always ahead of the competition and look at the joke of MS's DXR 1.2. Embracing NVIDIA's functionality over 2 years later and it's still not shipping till Q1 2026, while SER and OMM has been supported since Q4 2022 xD on NVIDIA side.  Intel has long played a leading role in graphics and ray tracing for a long time, before NVIDIA even introduced RTX + has invested a lot in research and is behind a lot of open source SW used in rendering applications. In addition, like NVIDIA, Intel went all AI and HW accell, for example they planned to have SER one year before NVIDIA, but Alchemist got delayed.   Meanwhile AMD used the bean counter approach of wait and see and relying on shaders, they still rely on that for BVH processing. Meanwhile NVIDIA and Intel took the full RT core approach right from the start. Look at where that got them. 5 years of ignoring ML super res only to go all in last minute with FSR 4 + no DLL swap until very recently (FSR 3.1) despite NVIDIA having that for over 5 years. I mean who TF runs that SW department, this is incredibly stupid. I agree that AMD's approach makes no sense.",hardware,2025-09-29 07:56:22,4
AMD,ngsk7ne,"Number 2  RDNA 4 is really just a stopgap nothing more, similar to RDNA 1. They also had Vega iGPU for many gens until RDNA 2 came along, RDNA 3.5 looks to be another repeat of that. RDNA 5/UDNA is poised to be another RDNA 2 full stack moment except this time probably a lot better and less complacent on the SW side.  Me too but based on all the changes suggested in patents (we'll see how many actually ends up in products) + rumours of a clean slate overhaul not seen since GCN in 2011 the picture is slowly taking form and best case assuming NVIDIA keeps rebranding Ampere cores (they really haven't done foundational changes since then) gen the nextgen from AMD could be the most competitive since the Terascale based HD series.  Not gonna spill the beans on the patents today, it's too early but right before launch, then perhaps I might eventually do another post similar to the one I did in the Spring that was picked up by tech media. All you need to know is that AMD id seemingly doing a fundamental overhaul of pretty much every aspect of a GPU, with a particularly strong focus on cachemem system efficiency and data locality.  But I can tell about the major scheduling changes in some of the patents, but it's really just the tip of the iceberg alongside the DGF + prefilter stuff.   Scheduling will go from top down orchestrated to localized hierarchical scheduling and dispatch down to the CU unit. Scheduling will be offloaded to Shader Engines with the command processor job being only to prepare work items and do load balancing between Shader Engines through ""work stealing"" indicated on idle or overloaded signals from the individual Shaders Engines. As a new thing scheduling and dispatch can be decoupled from the SPI completely at the CU level allowing each WorkGroup processor to dispatch its own work queue with unprecedented granularity and latency. The patent mentions an order of magnitude improvement in thread launch performance.  I have a post in here on that from \~8 weeks ago in case you're interested that goes more into depth. All this is to deliver better core scaling and prob drive increased performance for branchy code and GPU Work Graphs API workloads.

There's also the IBM method from a decade ago where they give every core a large L2 cache, and a portion of the L2 cache can be tagged by another core to be used as a virtual L3 cache. Or a CPU die can use another CPU die's L2 caches as a virtual L4 cache (as long as the CPU dies are on the same package to avoid communicating over the motherboard).

The data is guaranteed to be in one of those four memory locations (or not at all).   Which makes lookups very fast, you look at the memory address to find which set it should be in, and fetch that set's tags from the tag array. All four tags can be checked in parallel with special hardware, and then it knows exactly where in cache the data will be found.   -----  The cache needs to be small because of physics.

The only potential benefit is somewhat reduced interconnect.   On a consumer system with 2 CCDs, that's not a problem.   On a server with 4 CCDs... also not a problem.   If you're going up to 8 CCDs then you're probably looking at a ring bus topology for distributing cache... and at that point it MIGHT make sense to centralize the last level cache on the IOD.

There also the fact that heavier games aren't going to be at the top as single players stories get 90% of their sales on launch. That is why dying light is up there near the top 10.

They will can go to 11000MT/s and gain another 30% memory bandwidth   4) Can easily give in the same cache as regular desktop ryzen which should add 2-3%   5) They could go with a single 8 core CCD which would cut power draw and give the GPU more power. Zen 6 is rumored to have a 12 core CCD which will give a single CCD config much better performance while keeping latency down  6) LPDDR6 should give much more bandwidth also and improve performance  Just the first 2 which can easily be done today would put this past a 5060 if not 5060ti, so substantially better than a laptop 4070 and would crush PS5.

Generally, the 7800X3D offers the best value for money, while the 9800X3D offers the absolute peak performance for gaming. If you value performance per dollar, the 7800X3D is your best bet. Despite being last-gen, it's arguably the 3rd best CPU in the world for gaming (behind the 9950X3D and 9800X3D).  Even so, if you play games where you are regularly CPU-bottlenecked (e.g. lower resolution, low-fidelity games, console emulation, etc.), you may value the performance uplift of the 9800X3D more. The higher the graphics fidelity of the game (and the more strain on your GPU), the less relevant the CPU is in the equation.  For example: the 9800X3D and 7800X3D will perform almost identically in Cyberpunk 2077 at max-graphics, 4K raytraced.

What actual budget are you working with?   If you look at cost for cpu and performance looking at some of the benchmarking there isn't much difference in 7800x3d vs the 9800x3d im 1080p depending upon the game around 8 to 10 percent depending if it is esports or triple a title. Hardware unboxed has a decent video comparing the two in various games. From what i see the difference in cost is 476 to 338 possibly in your area.   I chose a different cheaper 850 board with wifi 7. If you want an ATX intead i would suggest looking at asrock b850 pro rs  is an alternative i would look at.   As for the card i would go with the amd 9070 xt prime oc that has a higher boost clock for overclocking.   I would drop the 1tb second drive for a 2tb.

If you plan on playing BF6 on release and they still haven't fixed the RAM consumption issue, I'm like 90% sure this will fix your issue if you haven't already. Also on a side note, I have a 3060 Ti and a R7 5700X3D, and boy was the game terrifically smooth! for the first day or two (despite the crashing), even on 80-90 FPS it genuinely rivaled the smoothness and polish at that fps that I get at like 120-144FPS on other games. My 1% and 0.1% were impressively high so that's likely why the game felt so smooth, though I eventually switched to Low settings with DLSS4 quality for the remainder of the beta since even low settings looks great.

I wouldn't consider modern xx70/xx70 Ti to actually be that when it's priced like xx80 or has weaker gains than previous generations.

AMD,nibnode,With frame gen during the beta I was getting pretty steady 140-165fps with almost everything at ultra and dlss quality at 1440p. This was on an 11700k and a 4070ti so I’m hoping performance will be similar… this chart makes it seem like it will not.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 22:10:49,6
AMD,nidior0,"1% high is the top 1% of the fps, the opposite of 1% lows.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 05:22:42,1
AMD,nigec67,"I meant that they don't how it performs on every cenario (where in the game, where looking to in the game, all the GPUs, all the CPUs, etc).  For example, in  Fallout4, if you look to the ground outside the main city you will get a very good FPS, but if you look to too many buildings inside the main city, you might get half what you had outside.  Some games, even if you follow the same steps, you might get different results on FPS due to random objects.  Theses tests give little information if you do them while developing the game, because future changes can throw away all tests done in a previous build, then new tests must be made with many combinations of GPU, CPU, SSD, RAM, ingame configurations, etc. Also, doing development all the configurations that make Medium and Highmight change, Low and Ultra usually mean lowest and highest, which **usually** doesn't change.  Given that few games get released with minimal bugs, I really doubt they fully test it before launch.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 17:24:29,1
AMD,nihwz1b,"I KNOW RIGHT! I've played BF1, BF5, BF2042, and BF4 and 3 on my PS4, so I've gotten used to the great optimization that Battlefield always seems to deliver, and so I was also expecting the same for BF6, and that they most certainly did deliver on, though it still impressed me for two reasons; For one, I felt like the volumetrics were a huge step up from previous titles and you'd think that it would affect the performance exactly like how you mentioned in this comment, yet it didn't! Secondly, I had become so used to the awful performance being delivered from modern titles nowadays, coupled with my very low expectations before the beta, that despite the fact that Battlefield always delivered with great optimization, I genuinely thought that this game would be the exception, but no! So yeah, I'm very pleased with this game and I can't wait for it to release!     If what I said previously does work when the time comes, I'm glad to have helped!",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 21:56:29,1
AMD,nibd2sl,Oh I'm 100% sure EA knew they could not screw up this time or battlefield would be dead,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 21:13:38,3
AMD,nihdsla,I know what you mean. I returned Borderlands 4 after trying it. I was getting a *rough* 60 using medium/high settings (from Hardware Unboxed optimized recommendations) with FSR balanced at 4K. But emphasis on *rough* since the 1% lows were around 30-40 even when just walking through the world.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 20:17:31,1
AMD,niekk2m,Yup. When its drawing double the wattage... And 5090 is only like 30-40% faster in raster....,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 11:26:14,1
AMD,nib2rg0,"You can at least add frame gen too since you’ll be hitting an acceptable frame rate without. I know it’s a dirty word on this sub but give it a shot, it’s done well for me when I want to max out a HRR monitor. If you don’t like it you can always turn it off",pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 20:22:16,2
AMD,nicflrs,Why don’t you? Most of that chart is showing performance at native no upscaling,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 00:54:24,1
AMD,nigl46z,"> And 5090 is only like 30-40% faster in raster....  Where are you getting this from?  All of these are no RT, no upscaling, native 4k:  TechPowerUp has it as 70% faster, Hardware Unboxed 63%, Tom's Hardware 66%, LTT 66%  I know that there are games that just run better on AMD, but that's why you do an average, and I can't find any source that has the 5090 only 30-40% faster than the XTX over several games",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 17:56:36,1
AMD,nidhvfj,"I was reading that wrong, I was interpreting balanced and performance as dlss options. I was thinking they weren’t even quoting quality performance but I see what’s going on now.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 05:15:39,1
AMD,nigokcr,"true i guess it does look like its closer to 60%, regardless, i drop that down to about \~15-20% with my evc2se.  at least throughout the 3dmark benchmark suite. for example i get 22-23k on time spy extreme where 5090s get around 25-26k?  not bad for a 2 gen old gpu that's less than 1/3 the price",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 18:13:36,1
AMD,ni64536,Its still mostly fine unless the games he plays are all CPU intensive games  Also if you are playing in QHD above then it matters even less. get 16GB VRAM GPUs btw,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 01:03:00,5

AMD,ni6i25p,"The 3700x isn't a bad CPU at all.  As per gaming, it depends if you're playing the latest and greatest, which GPU you have, and what the settings are.  I would strongly recommend updating the BIOS to the latest version, just to be on the safe side.  Which CPU cooler is he running?",pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 02:24:06,1
AMD,ni7v8d6,We just upgraded my buddy with my old 3700x and a 2080. Old parts and some new parts from Amazon. 32gb ram. Ended up about $500 all told. Runs anything out today at 1080p no worries,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 09:31:02,1
AMD,ni6kjve,He’s using a regular stock cooler and right now he is rocking a GTX 1070 right now and I’m planning on upgrade his power supply so I can put the 3060 as temporary so I can find a good deal with the 3080 TI,pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 02:39:03,1
AMD,ni75nto,"I would opt for a better CPU cooler.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZS1TWD6?th=1  This is purely to give the CPU as much cooling help as you can within a low cost.  With that said, could you share the motherboard, case and RAM specs?",pcmasterrace,2025-10-07 05:15:55,1

AMD,nidwdzi,Did you invest in a fire extinguisher? lol,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 07:35:59,1
AMD,nigku2h,The TUF is the weakest with a powerlimit of 335W/370W max. The Taichi is the most powerfull with 366W/404W  max.  The normal Nitro is 350/385. Dont know about the +  The other powerfull 9070XT is the XFX Mercury OC with 360/400.  I would get the Taichi. BUT it has that stupid 12v-2x6. But that should not be a problem with a max power of 404W.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 17:55:16,1
AMD,nih0y91,"Hardware unboxed tested all of them in many games and has graphs for temps, just look there,  I’m personally getting the sapphire nitro+, had great experience with their previous nitro+ cards, had a 5700xt, have  6700xt currently, great temps and OC undervolt capabilities",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 19:15:38,1
AMD,nihrmrb,"Sapphire Nitro + for performance, XFX Mercury for better temp.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 21:27:48,1
AMD,niia525,I always recommend to check ir out yourself.   Hardware unboxed has a great video where he compares the performance and temperatures of the different 9070xt models.  I went with the XFX Mercury OC. Great card. I run my fans at 35% speed and my hotspot reaches 77-78°C max.,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 23:13:24,1
AMD,nigklcj,Sapphire and XFX craft the best AMD gpus you can find. (The Nitro series of Sapphire has improved cooling and more performance),pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 17:54:06,1
AMD,nigs07w,"XFX Mercury and Sapphire Nitro + are the best, but you may as well get some of the other models. Most of them are decent, so it is a matter of preference.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 18:30:43,1
AMD,nigoyje,"Yeah, so i should probably stay away from TUF (because from what u said its just brand pricing). I also saw people saying that XFX and Sapphire make the best AMD cards but from what I read online the Taichi versions seem to be really solid too. I’m just wondering why the 12V-2x6 connector is such a problem",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 18:15:34,1
AMD,nigp6q5,Thanks for the info but what do you think about the Taichi? Is it actually a good card or should I just stick with XFX and Sapphire instead?,pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 18:16:42,1
AMD,nigpkgg,"On the 9070XT it is not a problem, but it has a bad name, the 5090 uses it and they can melt on that card.. You do need to pay attention when plugging that sucker in.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 18:18:36,1

AMD,nijgilr,While the 9070 xt can be fine for casual blender it is also significantly worse than nvidia like worse than a 5060.  Not to mention for gaming and video editing the 5070 ti will also be better in so it seems like a no brainer if you have the budget unless the 5070 ti is signficantly more expensive or something,pcmasterrace,2025-10-09 03:37:16,-1

I would consider dedicating to either Headset or speakers and spend a smidge more on those. I do think the monitor I picked has built in speakers, so if you \*really\* needed speakers those should suffice.  Tbh monitor is very subjective, so at the end of the day unless you're in there looking at the monitor you won't really know what one you want.

AMD,nid7ex1,"Yeah, this looks like a pretty solid improvement. I mostly just want to clear up a few things.  Sometimes, I get really bad migraines and headaches which make me pretty much steer clear of headphones during those times, hence the speakers. I also play Geometry Dash, which is very sensitive to refresh rates, hence why I chose the original 240Hz monitor.  The case fans and CPU cooler change are very solid improvements. I'd say the reason I chose my original picks is because my current build has fans that sound akin to jet engines when the CPU is put under moderate load, so I was diligent on those decibel counts even though they barely affect anything. Also great choice replacing the MSI PSU with a different model, as also suggested bu u/ataleoffiction.  I'm honestly surprised there wasn't any significant bottleneck pointed out by anyone. I'm fairly new to this type of thing, so I'm shocked. Also, just noticed the case change, and I gotta hand it to you, it looks clean.  So, in conclusion, I saved your improvements and the only thing I changed was the monitor. Thanks for your help!",pcmasterrace,2025-10-08 03:50:45,2
AMD,nidcho2,"Normally i'd pick a cheaper case, but in this scenario the cost of the GPU just about warrants going with a case that has a vertical riser included (the hyte y40 does). The only concern is i'm unsure if it'd support a 9070 with enough breathing room on the window side of the case. You'd want probably 1-2 inches at least for it to be reasonable. I know some of the 4 series of cards barely fit in the hyte y40, making it basically pointless to even have fans on the card lol. Obviously you wouldn't want that.  Worst case scenario you end up installing it normally (horizontally) and risk it sagging over time.

PC hardware was moving very quickly then, but the concepts placed in its gpu carried over to next gen gpus in the pc quite well.   I would also say shared memory on the Xbox one was deceptive as more was reserved (10% originally) for the system lowering useable pool by the gpu and cpu, home towers by the point often had 8gb of memory with gpus between 2 and 4gb, though quickly moving to 6 to 8. The 2 and 3 gig gpus left at moderate settings quite quickly.   Further I would say the evidence of hindering next gen games can be seen in what we know were axed from titles supporting it, like infinite local co-op, and comments by developers like the Xbox one/ Xbox series gen. Vs how the games that made the jump from the 360 generation to the one generation faired.

Nvidia is focused else where, and is still recovering from almost dieing as a company, and gpus paid a heavy price… and intel is dealing with a decade of poor choices…. Despite all of that hardware has advanced pretty well, while your hardware can probably last a decade at this point with settings degrading until playability is lost, it’s not a hardware progression issue.

AMD,nhnd26v,"I mean I wouldn’t go that far.  Both of their IP is good. And putting things together isn’t all that difficult.   The “simplest” solution is for Intel to make old CPU and have a UCIe interconnect implementing PCIe protocol where the Nvidia chiplet looks like a dGPU to the system.  Has its own vram etc. (like Kabylake G)  Separation between system memory and device memory.  But of course the solution they are after is to have shared memory which is a bit more complex, but not too bad.  A bigger question is if Intel is only going to be using Nvidia CUDA cores, or if they are going to have Nvidia video encoding, display engines etc.  AMD constructs their halo and APU parts with the GPU being a first class citizen with access to memory BW, while the CPU can often tolerate higher latency and lower BW.  My guess is that it’s Nvidia IP all the way to their L2 implementation, but then switches to Intel IP and SoC fabric.   So long as Intel and Nvidia don’t royally screw things up, (like implementing a SoC fabric or chiplet construction with stupid latency and BW bottlenecks) it should perform almost identically compared each of their respective configs on their own.  Nvidia already has their own APU project “DIGITS” with mediatek making the cpu tile and Nvidia the GPU one. This Intel project is almost certainly the same.  The benefits of the “big APU” compared to the standard CPU + dGPU is mostly cost and power savings.  You don’t duplicate IP like display engines and video encoders, and the OEM doesn’t need to buy both system memory and VRAM.   Power consumption is also slightly lower as well since you aren’t moving data across the PCIe bus and LPDDR memory is more efficient than GDDR.",AMD,2025-10-04 01:35:06,14

Opteron was great. they moved to bulldozer, it flopped but they actually made it not bad on mobile after several iterations. still not great but actually pretty efficient and they learned a lot of power control/clock control/efficiency information which helped them make Zen better.

Even after Intel got equal footing by switching to TSMC silicon and released newer more efficient Core Ultra, they still didn't really change the fundamentals.   Intel went from traditional to big.little and that's pretty much their biggest change, core ultra is a nice try but gaming side of the things fall flat.

Both Nvidia and Intel are known for coasting, but Nvidia has a pride and always want to be the best, even if they are behind they will push for unfair software advantage just so they can be perceived as top.  I think AMD understands having Nvidia in x86 world might change somethings as Nvidia is known to push for software that favors their hardware, and in future games Nvidia could have GameWorks 5.0 that will make AMD cpu run like crap so they will have to be extra careful when Nvidia (and Intel now both with thick wallet) try to buy and push for more proprietary junk that could be implemented in most games.",AMD,2025-10-04 01:36:59,8

The FMF pacing is totally locked 240, the visual quality on 2.1 is good enough for 120 base because the gen frames are only on screen for like 4ms and the visual delta between frames is so small that the interpolation is much more accurate to start with.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.

Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3.

The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it.

AMD,n6f09jv,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed.

Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Intel,2025-06-27 19:06:33,3

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,ngphfd8,"u/PeakHippocrazy  This is completely normal behavior for your Intel Core Ultra 5 235U processor. Modern Intel processors, especially those in laptops like your Dell Pro 14, are designed to automatically park (turn off) cores when they're not needed to save battery life and prevent overheating. Your processor has 10 cores total, and Intel's smart technology decides which ones to use based on what you're doing, it doesn't need all cores running just for web browsing or light tasks. The cores will automatically wake up when you run demanding software that actually needs them.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

Motherboard Manufacturer Support:  Visit your motherboard brand's website (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.)  Download chipset/storage drivers for your specific board model    Most likely solution, download Intel RST drivers or AMD chipset drivers based on your motherboard's chipset  this will provide the NVMe controller drivers needed for Windows installation.",Intel,2025-09-11 20:48:05,1

AMD,navgz13,So what is the QVL list for x299 VROC? I can’t find that information. I can find QVL for C621,Intel,2025-08-27 01:45:34,1
AMD,nc8dq0y,"So I was able to download the files from the RDC. Currently when I run        eeupdate64e.efi /NIC=2 /DATA Dev_Start_I210_Copper_NOMNG_4Mb_A2.bin  It says ""Only /INVM* and /MAC commands are valid for this adapter. Unsupported."" This is for three 8086-1531 Intel(R) I210 Blank NVM Device. Presumably in order to program them with device id 1533, I need to run a different command or use a different tool?

AMD,nd0ymaa,"Yes, I've turned off the system animations, and the blinking cursors.  There aren't settings to switch fonts, to replace thin/faint fonts with bold ones. The folks developing Windows like Segoe Ui, maybe they can read it. There are regedit hacks, but I'm not sure how to do them. There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked. So far it has worked everywhere with dark text on light images, and it's worked very well.",Intel,2025-09-08 03:35:58,1
AMD,ndttm3h,I'm now on the new BIOS (with Intel default settings) and the crashing is still occurring on Core 8. Alas... I was really hoping that would fix it.  What are the next steps?,Intel,2025-09-12 15:01:43,1

Looks like this is the installer version, my apologies for the confusion since we were discussing three different software options earlier.  Alrighty, since you're using the latest version now, how can I help? Are you running into any issues with the new application, or is there a specific feature that's not working as expected?",Intel,2025-07-27 21:14:17,1

AMD,navj4sy,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Intel,2025-08-27 01:58:06,1

AMD,navjsxu,"Thank you for the reply. Sadly asrock doesn’t have a QVL for nvme drives in U.2 form factor or enterprise grade drives, just m.2. Let alone a QVL for VROC support. Looks like I’ll be the test subject for this.",Intel,2025-08-27 02:02:02,1
AMD,nbknxhv,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology.

Not sure if intel support can confirm but it appears the ASROCK X299 Taichi CLX supports VROC Raid across multiple VMD Domains, which is supposed to be locked behind Xeon scalable CPU/Chipsets.
