Intel,nd4rusz,"It's good they launching this, this card adds some competition to the landscape, but before anyone buys it they should figure out if their drivers are lighter weight.  It's hard to think of this fitting a niche of someone with a pretty powerful CPU who wants a midrange GPU.  The more ARC cards out there the more developers get familiar with them, the more XeSS v2 gets added to titles, the more the drivers get matured and the better future ARC cards will be.

Unless new leaks I'm not up to date with are discussing a G31 with a different prefix, everything points towards it being battlemage, not celestial.

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working.

I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.

We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

Based on the TOPS, the inference speed seems to be roughly comparably to a 3060TI for the B60 and the Dual being roughly comparable to a 4080, though i think realistically more like a 3080/4060 due to the bandwiths. I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.  Like for Strix Halo, I think it'd do best for MoE's but there's not much at the 30GB or so size (if you have 2X, I'd Llama 4 Scout Q4 (58GB) might be interesting once there are better tuned versions.",hardware,2025-05-20 09:28:26,2

If you have gfx1100 (navi31) on Linux you're basically have good (not perfect) support and most things work (especially over the past year - bitsandbytes, AOTriton, even CK now works. I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.  I think the real question you should ask is what price point and hardware class are you looking for and what kind of support do you need (if you just need llama.cpp to run, then either is fine, tbt).",hardware,2025-05-20 10:05:09,2

I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,11

After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.

But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs.

Intel,n94duvw,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Intel,n4j4ewg,"Driver support in games is very good these days, I have had considerably more issues on my NVIDIA PC than on my arc PC, over the last six months or so (I've also used that one more but still felt like a worse overall experience in terms of gaming drivers). Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",buildapc,2025-07-22 14:26:29,6

I appreciate intel's clean and intuitive driver GUI. I love the way the driver handles crashes, it's exemplary. The driver literally invites to try out some OC. Don't regret my B580. If I'd buy a new card right now, I'd be torn apart between B580 or 9060 XT.   But my main goal was/is a decent gaming experience with a  reasonable power consumption. I don't have a problem to fine tune settings to get stable 60 FPS and a flatline frametime.

You'll find that a majority of PC gamers are still playing at 1080p because 1440p isn't offering a great experience on cards lower than a 3070.

You can save on the cooler for now, use the stock one (comes with a 7600) until she has enough saved for an upgrade.  The Intel Arc A750 is certainly a contentious choice. The only reason I'd go arc at that price point is if she'll be doing a lot of high res video editing, otherwise I'd look at alternatives, possibly second hand. A 3060 12GB would be a nice to have for 3D as NVidia is completely dominant in that space, but you'd probably need some second hand luck; I find them for around 200 EUR in the Netherlands. It'll perform a bit better than the A750 in gaming too, and has way better software support.  You can always save on the case and may be able to shave off a bit going for an mATX board, though less than 140 EUR for a wifi one is unlikely.",buildapc,2025-08-03 12:58:30,4

Which is basically increasing power limits and adding boost, which makes the card to clock higher with same voltage, isn't dangerous.  And INSTALL ONLY WHQL DRIVERS. Basically this one's are like the Polished version of the first release. Like, they send v1, people download and test it (it's not a beta driver, is supposed to be stable), complain about issues and later they send v1 WHQL, which is like the 100% stable version.

It produces way better images than my 6600XT and noone but noone simply comments on overall image quality ..anyway I have hundreds of legal Steam games no cracked eh I also own the Epic games version.  See this damn card had a driver update while I had it that improves the performance and that's good its what we want but once the features drop and performance drops (for me anyway) after the next driver update I had to call it.  Its the poor driver software stack.  The hardware has serious potential!  A770 is maxed.  I see this B580 ownership  as I leased the card for the summer +$60.      Can you buy from the [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) USA website for our cost?? Shop our stores in the USA.   I should remind you the Steam cold crashes suck.  I have an Asus 850w Platinum for it and I know there's no power fail issue sooo its a goner.  Im old enough to say ive seen this before.

Intel,n6ses8s,"Honestly? If I were you I’d get a 9060xt 16gb for 350-370 and then enjoy your $400 saved.  Reason being that with your setup, once you start moving up in GPU, you’re not gonna see as big of a performance uplift because of your 5700x, which will start to slightly but noticeably bottleneck a 9070/5070 or above  Which if you did go with a 9070/5070, say you get one for $600, you’d need a new PSU, which is around $70-$100. And at that point, it’s not worth paying $300 extra for a 25-30% performance uplift at 1440p because thats a 50-60% price increase.  You could upgrade your CPU sure, but then at that point, with a new CPU/RAM/MOBO/GPU and Power Supply, that’s basically just building a whole new PC, and you’re not gonna be able to do that for under $800, nor should you because again, the price increase isn’t worth the performance increase.  If I were in your shoes, I’d get the 9060xt 16gb and ride out the rest of my PC for 4-5 more years playing at 1440p. After that, if Im unsatisfied with the performance and frames im getting in games, I’d sell it/keep it as a spare and start from scratch a brand new build ground up. And with the $400 youre saving today, why not get some games, a peripheral upgrade, a second monitor, or shit you could always just pocket and save it.

Intel,ndc08oa,"So this is the Intel Arc B50. It's an *extremely* power limited BMG-G21 with only 16 Xe2 cores (B580 has 20) and only a 128 bit memory bus, limiting memory performance to just 224 GB/s: B580 has 456 GB/s.  To get power down to 70 watts and be slot powered, it has utterly castrated the BMG-G21. Only 4 MB L2 cache is enabled (of the 18 MB on the silicon) and it runs 1,000 MHz slower than it does in B580. Some sources claim 8 MB L2 is enabled, so this appears to be a bit unsure at the moment. It's not remotely B580's 18 MB and Intel's dGPU caching architecture is still a train wreck from its IGP origins.  What Intel has done is given it a similar memory config to AMD's 7600XT, 128 bit GDDR6 and 16 GB of it and cut the BMG-G21 down so far it can barely do anything. It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.  It could potentially be useful for AI, since Battlemage has strong INT8 performance, hobbyist level AI is all about CUDA and PyTorch.

Engineering and architecture workstations are about rasterisation performance. The designs and drawings have to be rendered quickly and smoothly on your two 4K monitors, which a stripped back and power-throttled 70 watt BMG-G21 isn't going to do.  For very entry level visualisation, we use RX 7600XTs with 16 GB, they have AutoDesk and Bentley certified drivers and enough VRAM and rasterisation to handle it. The RTX 4060 Ti isn't that bad there either, again you need the 16 GB version. On the next refresh of the low end workstations, they're probably going to end up being 9060XT and 5060Tis. Both of those would smash this little thing silly.  To that, I'm not sure who Intel wants to sell this to. $350 isn't serious money and it's competing with gaming-intended GPUs (which are utterly fine for visualisation and design) of much higher performance. It doesn't have substantially more RAM than competing products, it doesn't ECC protect the RAM and workstations generally don't care for slot powered cards either way. The ones we use come as standard with 800 watt PSUs and our choice of ""gaming"" CPUs like Ryzens or Cores, or Threadrippers and Xeons - Xeons are a bit less popular these days.  I'm seeing only an argument here for it being a solid SFF video card.

Intel,nddjnu0,"The answer is kind of long, but most ARM chips (probably all) can’t emulate/simulate x86, however there is lots of software that does this. Under Windows it has kernel-level ARM to x86/64 translation for Windows binaries. Compatibility is pretty decent but it’s hard to tell under gaming since there’s no GPU drivers for anything but embedded ARM graphics.  Under Linux, it’s a totally different story. You have Box64 and FEX-EMU. I switched to all ARM years ago but it came with a learning curve. Compared to three years ago, there’s many high performance games and performance reaches about 50-70% of native x86 performance.  If you wanna see some games running on ARM you can check out some videos I made almost 3 years ago below. I cover native ARM games, ARM games running under Box64, games running under Box64/Wine, and games running under Box64 and Steam Proton.

Intel,nddylm8,"What resolution are playing at?  As for RAM, it's recommended but isn't priority for you. You have to manage everything else first, especially GPU... if you have a weak graphics card, it doesn't matter if you have 32gb or 64gb of RAM... you'll be limited by the GPU before you run in RAM issues.  Depending on your monitor resolution, and resolution you play at.... 'maxed out settings' is going to be all relative. For example if you have 1440P monitor, if you get a 5060ti/9060XT tier card.... you're not going to be playing maxed out settings without help of upscaler (DLSS or  FSR4).. 16 or 32gb RAM becomes irrelevant. I wouldn't worry about that right now.  As it stands... your choices are 9060XT @ $350, 5060ti @$430 and 5070 @$550. The 5070 will requires PSU upgrade, but others may not. 5070 comes w/ game code but limited to who you can sell to if you don't need it. Might be able recoup some money though as plenty of people who bought before promotion. w/ that in mind.. if you can get say $40ish for the game code.. the 5070 is better buy over the 4060ti. If you don't want to spend that much then it's a tossup between 9060XT and 5060ti. The 5060ti is about 5% better raw performance wise but does have a more widely supported DLSS software stack which at that caliber of card you are more likely to use.....so to you it may or may not be worth the extra $70.... if not and you really don't want to spend as much then 9060XT @ $350 is better value card in that budget.  If you prefer Nvidia card, then 5070 is overall better value card as it is 30-40% faster than 5060ti and why I'd pick it over the 5060ti if one can budget for it. Difference in performance is too big.  I'm not even bringing up (since someone else will) the AMD 9070 and 9070XT because they're well over MSRP and out of your budget and not worth it at the prices they sell at.... and at those inflated prices, you might as well move to 5070 ti (which is well over your budget as well).",pcmasterrace,2025-09-10 03:41:20,2

To me, enjoyable means it never dips below 60FPS... and target around 90FPS+.... to me that is enjoyable.  Unfortunately, People often have this misconception that because they spent X amount of money on a card, they can crank everything to ultra setting and the GPU should just be pushing out 120FPS constant. It's not how it works... you always have to tune your settings to what the card/hardware is capable of. I still have to tune settings for my 5090 in lot of AAA games. At least you are being reasonable about adjusting your settings lol.  Same thing applies to amount of VRAM a card has.... same misconception exists, ESPECIALLY on this sub, that you need LOTS of VRAM and anything below 16gb VRAM on GPU is useless... again, that's wrong. Just because 5060ti/9060XT have 16gb VRAM doesn't mean you can crank up settings and  it's gonna be faster.... it could have 96gb VRAM, it's still going to be 30-40% slower than a 5070 w/ 12GB VRAM at it's intended resolution (1080p/1440p).  Yah would have been nice if 5070 had more VRAM but in no world is a 16gb XX60 class GPU ever going to be a faster gaming card than xx70 class. Period.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",AMD,2024-08-02 03:44:51,1
Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,67

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.   Im damn sure (and I did this before with people at my home) that if I provide you with a game blind testing it with DLSS and Frame Gen, along with other games with those features on and off, you wont be able to notice at all.",AMD,2024-04-02 10:10:50,5

And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means? Probably has never google'd them, despite the fact one of the most well-respected FOSS wizards in this scene is trying to communicate with them. I hope gnif2 doesn't get upset from the trolls alone and wish him a good luck on Vanguard program.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",AMD,2023-10-31 06:11:46,7

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6

I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side.

So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

Nvidia isn't exactly paying AMD even when they hold 90-95% of the market. Legislative scrutiny tends to come from manipulative practices, not from just selling a better product.

No one will defend AMD products before Zen 1.   I will definitely use a newer better AMD chip today but back then he'll no. There GPU line has driver issues and its why all of us just use NVIDIA gpus. There is a good reason.    Intel's new chip design strategy and leading edge fab is solid. The problem is foundry capital expenditure and foundry capacity. They have to build excess and train excess personal. The Ohio Silicon Heart Land. A whole new campus, town, new families, and Silicon ecosystem.    That takes time and a ton of money. And investment (aka the money levers) just dont want to pay for this. They rather get there money's worth of AI and self driving vehicles today. They know Chinese EV investment is bad and Chinese AI is bad. So rather than invest in Chinese companies and not make money, they want to use there leverage to pump up American companies.    This way American companies like Tesla and AI will succeed and win this AI race.   In other words, China ain't in the leading edge foundry game. None at all. No chance. So why pump money into that? They instead are attacking the EV and AI race. So our American companies will need capital to defend that space.   Intel design products are absolutely solid. 1000% they maintain better MT performance without SMT. SMT has security vulnerability.    Intel products are wafer Silicon efficient with p and E cores. Intel design is solid. Just foundry is extremely expensive and there isnt a China competitor. Taiwan is a very safe island.   If Taiwan was like a Hawaii, easily conquered, then for sure TSMC is at risk. But Taiwan today is like an island carrier/fortress. Too difficult to go against.

AMD,ndett58,"Okay so a few corrections because your understanding of the situation is totally off: the driver isn't doing a DLL swap currently for FSR4. It's actually the FSR3.1 SDK that's implemented in the game that's doing the swap. Also one more correction: ALL FSR 3.1 games use a DLL. The only thing that isn't standard is the use of the AMD provided and signed DLL. But all 85-ish games mentioned in the article here still use the signed FSR3.1 DLLs. The blacklist for FSR4 is empty now: now all titles that have the official, signed FSR3.1 DLL can be upgraded.   The FSR3.1 SDK has a function included that checks to see if the driver has allowed an FSR4 upgrade for a specific title (and setting the option in Adrenaline will toggle this value). If the FSR3.1 SDK sees that value sets, it grabs the FSR4 DLL from the driver files directly, and uses that instead. FYI, this is also why FSR4 can be injected on Linux in exactly the same fashion - Proton supports setting this registry key that indicates whether an FSR4 upgrade is possible or not. Currently, Adrenaline does not let you toggle this value to enable the FSR4 upgrade for titles that use a non-signed version of FSR3.1 - so if a developer makes a couple of small changes or tweaks to the FSR3.1 SDK and/or just decides to compile their own DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade will not be an option in that title (at least, at the moment).  However, members of the Optiscaler Discord have tested that if you replace a game's non-signed FSR3.1 DLL with the signed official DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade toggle does appear in Adrenaline.   > Important note - FSR 4 is not compatible with FSR 3.1 titles that run on the Vulkan® API or use non-standard methods of integration of FSR 3.1 into their games, such as using third-party plug-ins or methods that do not use the signed FSR 3.1 DLL.  > In short, some devs shipped unsigned FSR 3.1 DLLs from older plugin versions and FSR4 won't support that.   > Easy fix that should work - replace the FSR 3.1 DLL with the signed one from FFX SDK 1.1.4/FSR 3.1.4  This is actually something AMD could do in the way Nvidia does with DLSS4 DLL swapping in their driver as an experimental feature. But this only affects a handful of UE5 titles, to my understanding. Most FSR3.1 games use the officially provided and signed FSR3.1 DLL.",hardware,2025-09-10 08:12:23,3

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz.

But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron.

AMD started at similar performance level of Haswell, which was 4 years old at the time.   Reddit is heavily biased towards entusiasts when it comes to PC hardware discussions. People upgrading every other generation is not the norm.    Had you instead bought a 8700K back in 2017, you would still be using a chip that is perfectly passable today. Sure the fastest AM4 has to offer is considerably faster for things like gaming. But it is not nearly the same leap as someone who jumped on Ryzen 1 and is now comparing vs a 5800X3D. The jump from a 8700K to 5800 series is closer to ""normal"" progress in the 5 year period from 2017 until the last major AM4 launch.  Normally, most consumers would see no reason to upgrade in that time frame. If you bought a 7800X3D at launch, by the time that thing is obsolete for a normal consumer and they would consider a upgrade. You would be looking at a whole new platform.

AMD,nd367aj,"Non existent.  That was a thing about a decade ago.  First of all, Intel can still produce in different nodes.  Intel had the problem that they developed both architectures and process nodes together which both had advantages and disadvantages.  You can’t just switch out the process node for an architecture, every architecture is designed for some nodes specifications. The more you focus on one node the better you can use its advantages which is one of the reasons why Intel was typically superior with their chips. But that also comes with drawbacks like Intels 10nm issues.  Intel didn’t stay with basically Kaby lake for years because they wanted to but because they couldn’t switch to ice lake without the 10nm node. And that’s the reason why Intel fell back on the desktop and servers. If you look at their roadmaps, what became Tiger lake H was supposed to come out as Ice lake in like 2018. But with Rocket Lake they backported Ice lake to 14nm which worked more or less well, depending on who you ask. Since then, Intel developed their Architectures with no specific node in mind which makes them as flexible as any fabless company.   I’d say if anything it’s a huge advantage to have your own fabs today because you can determine how much volume you want for yourself.  TSMC is basically a monopoly at that point which also means that all three, NVIDIA, AMD and Intel compete over capacities and that drives up cost.  And then there is Apple. Apple is like a first class customer of TSMC (for good reasons) and they’re the ones to decide how much they leave for the rest.",hardware,2025-09-08 14:13:42,7

I imagine TSMCs customers pay what TSMC tells them to, only constrained by the reality they can't get too crazy lest they help support Intel when the customers revolt.

For example, AMD has shown flexibility in the past, like when they re-lithographed Polaris (RX 580 → RX 590 on 12nm). Would that kind of move count as being “not node tied”? * And for Intel specifically, how should we think about this? Are their designs today still bound in ways that limit shifting across nodes, or is the tile-based approach (like with iGPU/cache tiles on Intel 3 vs. cores on 18A) essentially giving them AMD-like flexibility?

That seems to be a big part of why everyone from Apple to AMD has enough trust to let TSMC handle their lithography.

AMD,nd327b2,"ADL/RPL were designed specifically for Intel 7. Intel 7 was design with ADL/RPL in mind. The two are closely related. It would require a lot of work to bring ADL/RPL to a different node.   One of the main improvements that ARL/LNL brought was internal design changes that make Intel designs in line with industry standards, using industry standard design tools vs previous designs being custom-made for specific internal nodes. This doesnt matter (directly) to the customer, but it does help Intel's engineering efforts easier going forward.    And while yes there's an opportunity cost to continuing to use Intel 7, a lot of Intel 7's cost structure was paying off the massive NRE costs due to its multi-year delay. These costs were fully depreciated H2 of last year, making Intel 7 much more cost effective.   But besides that, fabs need different types of nodes at different price points. The lithograph equipment used for Intel 7 can't just be reporposed for new nodes which use EUV. Its either use it on Intel 7 (or 16) or let it sit unused.

As for tooling and machinery, some of them that were intended for the fab expansions that are now either cancelled or have been slowed down, have been repurposed as upgrades for existing manufacturing, so expect those to pay themselves off as well in the future. 2. Since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake, Intel's core IP, at least on the CPU side, is ""99% process node agnostic"", to quote one of the lead engineers who worked on the Lion Cove P-core that goes into Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake. What it means that they don't have to design with a specific process node in mind, and their workflows and design rules reflect that.  3. Basically the choice of node boils down to performance-power-area - which are intrinsic to the nodes themselves, and cost of wafers, time-to-market, and volume availability.

Adding a larger cache may. Density should help there.   Memories can really benefit from a die shrink because in theory you can have the same design with minor updates just smaller. Then you can have more dies, or arrays of memory cells.   Designs that have multiple dies also have special trade offs in that area. It gets very technical.   Thermal considerations also are really part of this. Many devices are now thermally limited so whatever process reduces heat or helps extract that heat to the cooling design has an impact.

AMD,nc00dol,"The 5070 Super is rumoured to have 6% more cores, as well as 18GB GDDR7 and possibly a small clock speed bump. It should be reasonably powerful, probably matching the 9070 in raster. If that is the case, the 5070 Super could be a no-brained.  But I would guess that AMD will refresh the 9070 if Nvidia refreshes the 5070. It won't get a VRAM bump, but I could see them bumping the power limit up to the same wattage/CU as the 9070XT, which would be 266W. The 9070 is currently so power limited that simply pushing more power is a completely viable option for a refresh.  266W would enable AMD to bump the clock speeds by 300-400 Mhz, which would keep the 9070 firmly in contention with the 5070 Super, while costing AMD and their board partners nothing, since 9070s usually have 9070 XT coolers specced for 304W or higher, I think the Sapphire pulse 9070 is the only exception.  AMD would simply have to push a new BIOS and/or unlock the power limiter in Adrenalin. They could potentially even push an update in Adrenalin that swaps the vBIOS.  I'd probably still pick the 5070 Super over the 266W 9070, but it still wouldn't be a complete no-brainer, since the 5070 Super would probably be worse in raster, but better in RT.

At that point it’s a useless test.  It’s not like it’s impossible to test at multiple settings, but 1) reviewers have a limited amount of time to test cards, and the time they have is only getting shorter with each review cycle, 2) medium settings aren’t standardised. Leaving out naming oddities like GTA V’s high being the medium setting, what each game decides to reduce when lowering settings down to the medium preset isn’t standard, one game might disable grass textures entirely while another will barely reduce them, and so on. If you want all games tested to be on a level playing field, it makes sense to crank all the settings to max. And 3) the whole point of a test is to push the GPUs to the max. If you drop the settings down to medium, with the high end modern cards you’re going to be limited by the CPU. If you do all your comparisons at 1080p low, then you’ll conclude that a 5080 has about the same performance as a 5090, even if that is definitely not the case.",hardware,2025-09-03 09:05:48,-1

Other places people would basically just be like ""oh nice grats"" etc. Whenever I'd find those no reddit there'd be a bunch of comments calling OP crazy, telling them the processor wouldn't last more than a few weeks etc etc. One particular comment I still remember was ""You better already have another one coming to you in the mail, because that'll be dead by this time next week.""

AMD,nc47tse,"Here's why Intel will never make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and why their situation is different to AMD/Radeon's.  1. Intel is basically an upstart in GPU, they have zero brand presence or mindshare to build off of. AMD on the other hand has Radeon which has been around for 20+ years. In fact the only thing gamers know about Intel's GPUs is their crappy Intel HD 3000 iGPUs that couldn't run games at playable frame rates. AMD doesn't have this issue.  2. Intel is slow to compete with NVIDIA. Look at Battlemage and how we're STILL waiting on the B770, it might not even release. People are not willing to wait for your product to release, if they want to upgrade, they will upgrade to what is available. AMD also doesn't have this issue, within a month or two, AMD was competing with Blackwell.  3. Intel had only bad press with ARC's initial launch, especially because of the drivers situation. Whilst Intel has tried to improve the drivers significantly and done a great job marketing Battlemage and the product even being solid, first impressions are hard to shake and had Alchemist had a better launch, Battlemage would have sold better. AMD doesn't really have this issue, they have for one or two gens but that was long ago and not anywhere close to the disastrous driver situation Intel's had. AMD drivers for the most part, might have a small issue in a few games on release, but they actually worked and were able to play games. Some games on Alchemist wouldn't even launch or run correctly.  4. Battlemage and Alchmeist doesn't compete across the stack. For what it's worth, only competing with basically the 4060 made Battlemage a sort of pointless generation because if you bought say an RTX 3060 years ago, it's not really an upgrade to buy a B580 or B570. Furthermore, if you have a 3070 or anything else, you literally cannot upgrade to a Battlemage card because it's a downgrade in performance. Competing across the whole stack is essential to getting sales and to convince people that your product is fast. This is probably the closest problem AMD has to Intel, but with RDNA3 they tried to compete across the whole stack, they just got destroyed.",hardware,2025-09-03 01:21:43,5

It's not as simple as ""hurr durr, Intel has low prices and low margins and now they're broke"".

Well AMD is in a unique position because they have more than one product segment to fall back on. NVIDIA lives or dies by GPU, if the GPU they produce is utter garbage and GPUs fall out of favor in the wider market, their entire product portfolio is at risk and their future.

But I guess UDNA is supposed to make it so their server and business stuff contributes to gaming dev anyway by unifing them.   I do think RDNA4 could have still been selling well if AMD just produced lots of GPUs at MSRP, and maybe lower the the 9070's MSRP so it's undercutting the 5070. 9060 XT however isn't selling much it seems even though it's probably the best GPU in its price class, guess they needed to price match the 5060 with the 16GB model?

I'll concede on that point, most LLMs are probably running on server hardware, not local.   I won't concede that 1/5 is a conservative estimate for DIY to prebuilt sales though. I'd say 1/10 is realistic if you look outside the US centric reddit hardware bubble.

Maybe in the US it's 1/5, but the rest of the world is far more heavily skewed towards prebuilts.   The main point is I agree with you, AMD is never going to catch up with Nvidia in dGPU market share, anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, even in the main AMD sub this is the prevailing opinion. I would even go as far as to say AMD could make a 6090 killer next generation for $999, and their market share wouldn't increase by even a single point because there are so many consumers who mindlessly buy Nvidia or buy prebuilts/laptops which might as well be 100% Nvidia at this point.   Lowering prices did nothing for AMD in the past, and it won't change anything now. AMD will just change their wafer allocation to favor CPUs and still sell every GPU they make at current margins. Why bother when the Nvidia fans who cry for lower prices from AMD have shown time and time again that they will just wait for Nvidia to lower their prices before buying Nvidia like they always have? Lowering margin only hurts their R&D fund for the next generation.    The irony is that the real losers of this arrangement are GeForce fans, Nvidia has no incentive to produce outstanding gaming products when they're this far ahead. They can afford to lose a few generations and have their market share fall to a precipitous 90% before they start trying again, hell they can afford to lose the entire mid-range and budget markets permanently as long as they have their $2000 5090 marketing prop that only a fraction of people can afford.

I've had my cousin's law firm go out and get AI assistants and I suggested he setup an instance tailored to his firm. But the firm did some digging and found a local company who just has hundreds of AI assistants that they lease out on a subscription model and who tailor their AI assistants to a specific style of business and they customise it so it knows who the people are at the business, the business name, emails go to specific business accounts etc. It was a few thousand a year to use this AI assistant company, but the firm don't have to troubleshoot or maintain it and you get free included bi-annual performance upgrades for the hardware that's running the model, and obviously they update the model too and make tweaks after they do testing to see if they can deploy the model to their clients. In the end, it's just a secretarial replacement really, so all the model needs to do is basic stuff like note down the name and number, who the person wants to talk to and forward emails.

They put in an order of 1,000 PCs and they might buy 100 office PCs, 300 basic gamer ones, then 500 moderate gamer ones and then 100 high end gamer ones to have different tiers in their cafe. But they're all DIY rigs really, just from a local techmall shop who cranks them out and services/warranties them. I've never seen an asian netcafe buy an HP or Dell prebuilt in years and things like iBUYPOWER or Origin PC aren't really popular in Asia as the DIY prebuilt market is huge there and it's all local small shops vying for business.

I don't think so. I think they could make a 6090 killer for $999, the problem is will they supply enough to make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and considering how intent AMD is on using TSMC, I don't think that will happen. It all goes back to AMD insisting on using TSMC, they need to diversify their foundry and if they want to take marketshare it might mean going to Samsung for your dGPU gaming products and getting cheaper but lower performance silicon to undercut NVIDIA. It won't happen because AMD probably doesn't want to ruin their CPU dominance and their relationship with TSMC is too important, so they will continue with TSMC. But also because AMD is moving to UDNA for dGPU, which means they are pretty much forced to having a unified architecture on one node, which now limits their foundry options.

The end result is 3 data sources that would tell anyone with reading comprehension that there is absolutely no way for AMD to outsell NV outside of niche situations where the vendor is allocating more AMD products than NV, and even that would be a drop in the hat compared to the sheer volume NV floods the market with.

Firstly, that's one retailer in one region. It doesn't prove ANYTHING about whether more RDNA4 shipped than Blackwell. I mean we can just see from Steam HW survey and JPR numbers that NVIDIA shipped way more stock in both Q1 and Q2 than RDNA4. So whilst Microcenter may not have gotten them or even maybe NA was neglected by NVIDIA, NVIDIA still shipped more cards to people on the whole. Again... your whole point was AMD was somehow masterful by delaying their launch so they could build up stock, yet the numbers do not reflect your theory. In Europe for instance there was barely any stock as evidenced by that same video. So AMD only cared to divert stock to NA and made other regions suffer.  Secondly, I wrote a whole lot and you NEVER answered it. So I'll try again. My whole point was you were trying to say that RDNA4 was smart to delay its launch so it could stockpile units, correct? Except that you also then said that there was only 3 weeks left in the quarter so that's why the Q1 RDNA4 numbers were disappointing.  So what is it?:  1. That RDNA4 had high volume and was smart to delay so they could stockpile lots of stock?  2.

AMD,naxidlt,"It seems like RDNA5/UDNA has a dramatically different cache hireachy.  The conventional 2/4/6mb L2 cache +32/64/96mb of L3 infinity cache is replaced by a bigger pool of L2  that's smaller than infinity cache and much larger than the old L2  but likely has lower latency than inf cache.  If I had to guess why they did this, it's probably to save on die area allocated to on-die SRAM since scaling for it has collapsed with 5nm.  Having less levels of cache also likely reduces validation time since it's less complex.  AMD is instead likely going to rely on a faster GDDR7 memory and a wider memory bus to make up for the smaller capacity",hardware,2025-08-27 11:39:02,5

AMD,nau22kp,"I do think the wording implies this is some new AMD trick that makes AMD's GDDR6 equal to Nvidia's GDDR7. That only makes sense if we pretend Nvidia doesn't already have aggressive compression, which they’ve had for years. Historically, Nvidia's compression has been better than AMD's as well.  A ""\~25% fabric traffic reduction"" in gaming tests isn't a free +25% to external bandwidth, and it doesn't erase a \~40% raw GB/s gap. Even if we assume AMD just matched or let's even go as far as to say \~10% better than Nvidia's compression, they'd still be well behind on effective bandwidth.  The simpler explanation for those results is that the tested scenarios aren't that bandwidth-bound. Once bandwidth clears a threshold, other limits (shader/geometry/queues, cache behavior, drivers) dominate. So ""RDNA4 compression makes GDDR6 keep up with GDDR7"" overstates the feature by a lot.",hardware,2025-08-26 21:04:21,18

It'll probably be a Accelerated interface die acting as a base die (with PHYs, L2 and CP) connecting directly to mem PHYs. This is the workload preparation stage (work items), then these are distributed and load balanced across autonomous shader engines that handle their own scheduling and dispatch. We can call these shader engine dies (SED). This will probably be clusters as one SE is very small, half the size of Zen chiplet rn.

AMD,naxro34,"Kepler\_L2 said L0 and L1 is merged in CDNA4. Maybe RDNA 5 goes even further and merges all CU level caches (including VRF) into one big shared flexible cache like Apple did with M3 and A17 Pro.   Like you said it's about SRAM scaling being bad and minimizing SRAM investment. N3P = no scaling, N5 poor scaling vs N7.      NVIDIA definitely has the advantage here while AMD's cache system is overly complicated and inflexible. The next logical step is to make caches into one big shared block that can be dynamically allocated for different purposes.   L1 will be much more important with the new WGS and ADC scheduling and dispatch within each SE. No more global scheduling only work item preparation and load balancing. This and other methods could explain why L2 will be less important and less used allowing AMD to use 24MB L2 on AT2 (According to MLID and Kepler\_L2 rumours).   Actually the rumour for AT2 is +25% CUs and -25% PHY width vs 9070XT, so perhaps AMD has some novel and forward looking memory saving technology in UDNA. AT2 on paper could easily be stronger than 4090 in raster and that's wild with 24MB L2 and such a weak memory subsystem.  Not expecting anything at AMD FID 2025 but maybe there's a slim chance that they'll share a glimpse into RDNA5. 2027 can't come soon enough.",hardware,2025-08-27 12:37:37,1

AMD is matching and exceeding 50 series functionality + tons of scheduling overhaul. If we assume AMD just caught up to 50 series then AMD still has OBB + Dynamic VGPR allocation and Ray instance node transform in HW, NVIDIA doesn't have these rn. But like I said there's so much more in the patent filings going beyond NVIDIA 50 series implementation.  Don't care about the BS MLID PS6 perf PT >5080 or Kepler's RT 2X perf gain per CU.

Complete clean slate moment. You're comparing a Terascale -> GCN moment with a major architectural tweak, albeit still no more than a tweak.  NVIDIA has had OoO memory since Turing. WGPR is really cool but AMD wasn't the first to introduce it. Apple has had it since 2023. OBB is nice and actually an AMD first for once but I suspect this is really Cerny's doing more than anything. WMMA is just catching up to NVIDIA 40 series ML HW 2.5 years later.  RDNA4 had a small relatively IPC increase. I did the math months ago. Think it was around 6-8% but not sure. Only exception is 7600 -> 9060XT but that card used RDNA 2 WGP data stores and not the beefed up RDNA 3 stores.  AMD held it back because they wanted to see what NVIDIA priced the cards at, then they didn't invest enough in the driver team + had absurdly low stock at launch so they had to delay the launch.  AMD has not been serious about competiting against NVIDIA since IDK when. where's the prebuilt SIs and OEM contracts? 8% total market share what a joke, if you look at prebuilt vs DIY then it's not good for AMD.

AMD,nb9ocih,"The new patents changes things quite significantly especially the scheduling changes that align with GPU workgraphs, but that's reserved for games many years into the future (fine wine). Apparently also major cache level changes in RDNA5 so that's another source of potential RT gains.  Conclusion on Spring post was a conservative on par with NVIDIA Blackwell, new patents suggest significantly ahead. Yes indeed and I mentioned that at the bottom of my comment. They can't allow AMD to take the PT crown. Also maybe something insane nextgen like a NeRF ASIC within the geometry pipeline. IIRC NVIDIA had a paper on this a while ago.     That's true but the interesting thing is that if you go even further back IIRC I couldn't find an RT patent that didn't get implemented in RDNA4. So at least for RT patents most of them can reasonably be expected to be implemented in RDNA5. Skeptical about the DMM patents, but everything related to DGF and prefiltering nodes is pretty much a given.  Perhaps this time it's different, we'll see but not fully convinced either.

The fundamental core is still Ampere which at is core is still Turing/Volta so a clean slate might happen and that could have massive ramifications similar to AMD's RDNA5/UDNA.  On AMD side let's just hope the architectural changes are massive + AMD's patent derived (unconfirmed) scheduling overhaul is forward looking like GCN Async compute.

AMD,nbvnuh2,"There's another patent supporting RDNA5 potentially being amazing if you're interested. Already mentioned it in the post 4 weeks ago, but I understated the impact. Local launchers are very likely to be arriving in each RDNA5 WGP. This will allow them to launch and schedule work and manage ressources on a per WGP basis with a 10x dispatch latency reduction vs the command processor within each shader engine (rn I think).   For workgraphs workloads this will result in insanely high speedups. Ray tracing and procedural code will see massive speedups. Unfortunately think this requires developers to change code like the Workgraphs API. But perhaps AMD can do some magic at the compiler level, but I doubt this. We'll see.  NVIDIA better have something major nextgen or AMD will leap frog them. Repeating myself here but Kepler already called RDNA5 the biggest change since GCN.

Xe3P based Celestial products were likely canceled after the disastrous midyear earning call in 2024  After the unexpectedly huge success of the B580/B670 Intel must've then restarted their DGPU/Large iGPU plans  That's because We're not seeing any DGPU Celestial leaks but we are seeing Nova Lake-A and AX that are supposed to ve ready in 2027  Considering Xe3 will be used in Panther Lake (Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 release) it supports my hypothesis.  **Intel's DGPU future:**  If we don't see DGPU Celestial products in 2026 then either we don't see them or Celestial will be like Battlemage and Intel will have to sell bigger dies that compete with smaller AMD and Nvidia counterparts in 2027 (likely sharing GPU silicon dies with Nova Lake-A and AX)   If they do release a Celestial DGPU then it will likely only be 1 or 2 SKU's that compete on price and are ready in 2027  It will likely be very quickly replaced with Xe4 Druid DGPU's in 2028 which should look more like a proper    AMD/Nvidia  GPU lineup.,hardware,2025-08-27 23:51:25,2

I would lean towards 9900x, I don't use Fusion, but I do Solidworks, SW is not very multi-threaded at all, unless for specific case, like flow works, solidCAM etc. If I were to build a tanky workstation right now (with company budget), I would probably go 9950x3d or 9950x (I run my CAD in VM and my workstation also acts as a server backup for my main server). Probably save the x3D premium for other hardware, so 9950x or 9900x.   2. Because of ITX, I would also go for AMD over Intel, it has a slightly (very slightly) lower need in peak thermal capacity. So you can get smaller cooler, smaller case. I think that in the day to day, I would not see too much difference in CAD work, but when you need to generate g code etc, or do (CPU) rendering, then the more cores the better.   3. If you are using company money, go for a Quadro or an equivalent Radeon Pro. There is nothing really wrong going with a gaming GPU, but for Solidworks, the preferred route is a professional graphic card, just for the sake of having no issue and getting support. So A2000 ada or A4000 ada will fit the bill.  This in turn reduce the thermal envelope you need for the GPU. But price is high on them... I know Fusion switch to DirectX... so you can get a gaming GPU and if you do play games on it.. then it's better, but if it's only for work, then quadro is the way I would go.   4. For the case, make sure you get the right thermal envelope need for the CPU, ITX can be very small, so after the CPU choice, you'll know if you need a AIO, a tower or a skinny heatsink.

AMD,ndgq9wt,"Thanks for the detailed answer! To clarify my use case: I only use SolidWorks occasionally for more complex design, but my main software is Fusion 360, mostly because of the CAM features. Depending on the toolpath I’m generating, Fusion will sometimes use a single core and other times multiple cores — and that’s exactly where I’m hitting a bottleneck with complex multi-axis toolpaths. That’s why I started looking at the i9-285K, since the strong single-core performance could help a lot in those cases.  I’d definitely love to run a Quadro/Radeon Pro, but my budget doesn’t really allow it right now. I also haven’t had any issues using my current RTX 2070,  so I feel okay sticking to a gaming GPU for this build.  I’m not planning to game on this machine since it’ll live in the shop, so I agree the x3D chips probably aren’t worth it for me. From what I understand, the 285K has better single-core performance and is a little more efficient for professional workloads, but at the same time I’ve been keeping an eye on the new AMD chips and I’m curious to test them out.  On top of that, my shop is growing, and I’m planning to start using metrology 3D scanners and reverse engineering software soon, which means my overall workload is only going to increase.

Simulation heavy games tax the CPU hard but generally, your CPU is way overpowered for the GPU, it's not a problem and gives you future proofing, but swapping from an X3D to a 7600X or 7700X should give you the budget for a 9070 XT which will be more beneficial across the board, you may even manage to do a 9600X or 9700X which will match very nicely with your chosen motherboard. Also, while the CPU cooler is a very effective choice, if you care about volume they are a bit on the loud side, especially with an X3D chip, little less so with an X chip. The RAM is the killer though, that's wiiiild. For gaming, it's very slow. Not only is the transfer rate low, the timing is also slow. Ditch the thermal paste (coolers come with it) and the saving should cover getting RAM in 6000MT/s and CL30, that's the sweet spot (often RAM is misadverised in MHz instead of MT/s, as long as it says 6000 you're good) Those changes should give you a nice well rounded build and still stay in budget.",buildapc,2025-09-08 22:16:22,1

AMD,ndcc8oo,I have a 6750XT paired with a 5600X. It plays pretty well at 1440p but I am really concerned with performance on Bordelands 4 the upcoming UE5 game.  For me that you give me close to 2x uplift on performance (excluding any CPU limitations),buildapc,2025-09-09 21:56:50,1

AMD,ndcq0mm,"Don’t think you can really go wrong here, but the price difference is so wild that it’s tough to give an actual recommendation. A 9060xt 16gb is, to me, the utilitarian choice. If you just want a card that can do 1440p/60+ in new AAA stuff with reasonable settings and smash everything else, that’s your best bet, and it’s the best “budget” card the market has seen in a long time. If you gave me 1000 bucks to build a PC, that’s the graphics card I’d pick, no questions asked. Built my gf a pc recently and did exactly that. The 5060ti 16gb isn’t half bad either if you can find it at MSRP in your region and the Nvidia feature set is worth the extra 60-80 bucks to you.   The other two cards are substantially faster, particularly the 9070xt, but I’m not a huge fan of either right now for different reasons. I wouldn’t pay more than 500 bucks (USD) for a 12gb card like the 5070, and the 9070xt is just too expensive in the US. Although admittedly it’s much more reasonably priced where you’re at, 650 is not too bad.",buildapc,2025-09-09 23:13:38,1

AMD,ndepf30,"tl;dr - my recommendation is to keep an eagle eye on sales and snag an RTX 5070 around $700CAD. 9070 XT is a reasonable higher end option, but perhaps a bit of an overspend based on the “medium to high” settings you’re aiming for. Linear raster performance improvement at $900CAD compared to $770, but actually worse if you find a $700 5070.   For 1440p you really want/need 12+GB of VRAM, so that puts the lowest entry point for the 9060 XT around $530CAD.  5070 at $770CAD is basically identical performance/$ to the 9060 XT 16GB at $530, and if you’re keeping an eye on sales (via /r/BAPCSalesCanada for example) there’s a pretty decent chance you could snag a 5070 for $700 or less. Just yesterday Best Buy had the MSI Shadow 2X 5070 for $687.  The Supers will almost certainly come in *January*, after the rush of the holiday season of course, so likely just over 4 months away. Between now and then we’ll get occasional sales to help clear out inventory. I fully expect the 5070 Super to sell for at least $900 for most AIB models for the first month or two before prices come back down to MSRP, possibly alongside the 5070 12GB dropping to the ~$700 range.  9070 XT at $900 CAD is also pretty much a linear raster performance improvement, so again same performance/$.",buildapc,2025-09-10 07:28:28,0

Now with the money that you save from financing you can also get that 32GB of ram instead of having to sacrifice it.

AMD,ndclwy5,"ok, so I like where u are going with this build but at $1100 we might want to go with a lower tier CPU for now. this is what I got  [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NTLrkf](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NTLrkf)   .    .Total:	$1129  So right now the Ryzen 5 7600 is on sale and will come with a decent stock cooler so no need to buy one. with it I picked a very nice motherboard that has plenty of USBs and a large VRM so it can handle any CPU ur son might upgrade to later. this is just how I see it but if upgrading is something that is important then getting a good motherboard will help with that down the line.  Now I did change the RAM to a kit of 6000mts CL30 this is a better value kit and most AM5 CPUs dont like running above 6000mts anyways. I also switched the SSD to a more reliable and better quality one for a similar price.   I like the case and that's kinda a personal choice so if u son likes it then Id keep it. I also think that is a really good choice for a GPU. I did swap out the PSU for a decent 750w unit, this will give him just a little more room for upgrades in the future and is a good investment  this list isn't perfect or the best value so feel free to change it to match ur budget or style. hope this helps",buildapc,2025-09-09 22:50:38,3

If the budget was 1250 or so then I would say its definitely worth considering but not at 1100.

I mean the ""I build until my CPU melts"" kind of bases. Otherwise, a 9600X is more than adequate for the 9060 XT. I recommend the 9600X over the 7600X because simulation-heavy games take advantage of the 9000 series IPC uplift. Check Gamers Nexus Stellaris benchmarks on the topic.

For that price you should just get basically any 9070 XT instead as it will perform better and has RDA4 / FSR4. Also possibly consider a 9070 or even 9060 XT 16 GB (9060 XT 16GB will be somewhat slower but you would also save \~ $400 from the PC Part Picker price on the 7800 XT).  \* Possibly downgrade the T500 unless you're doing video editing and save a little money there; most modern M.2 SSDs are so fast you won't notice the difference except in specific IO-intensive workloads.  \* PSU is solid B tier, should be great for this setup.

Sometimes I use frame gen (Fluid Motion Frames 2.1) to get 100+fps if I have a base of at least 50-60fps.   For things that you can also do in GFE (I think), I also use sharpening in some cases when anti aliasing/TAA/upscaling results in an image that's a bit too blurry, Radeon Chill to limit FPS if there's no option in game or the in game option is buggy, and in some games I'll turn on Radeon Anti-Lag, which is similar to reflex.  To get the best use out of Radeon Enhanced Sync (with Free Sync), you should also be using the driver level frame limiter (assuming the in-game frame limiter doesn't have a slider/custom values) to set your max frame limit to a number under your monitor's refresh rate. A good formula is refresh (refresh*refresh/3600), so for 120hz, you would set it it 4 less than 120, for 240hz, you would set it to 16 less than 224. Per digital foundry though, the Special K frame limiter is apparently the best frame limiter tool in terms of stability, input latency, and frame timing.

AMD,nd2eccm,5070 Ti outperforms the 9070 XT by a 5% average. 9800X3D will outperform the 7800X3D by about 5% as well so it might just even it out. Honestly it comes down to DLSS (Nvidia) vs FSR (AMD). DLSS is the better upscaling tech and has wider game support but FSR 4 has improved a lot over the years. Id probably go with the 7800X3D + 5070Ti  Hardware unboxed did a very good video where they tested both these GPU’s in 55 games;  https://youtu.be/tHI2LyNX3ls?si=0ofDu294Dw3EpLkP,pcmasterrace,2025-09-08 11:22:12,1
AMD,nd38nhq,"Both GPUs perform basically the same (at some games 5070 Ti is better, at some it's 9070XT). RT performance is a bit better on the 5070 Ti but the 9070XT is often very close in some games. The 5070 Ti has one big advantage: DLSS. AMDs good upscaling (FSR 4) isn't supported on many games and you often have to use the older FSR 3 or 2 that look way worse. DLSS on the other hand has more games supporting it's newest version and older versions of it still look good.  The 9800X3D is noticeably better than the 7800X3D at 1080p (up to 30fps more) but the difference becomes less noticeable at higher resolutions (especially 4K). At 1440p the difference is gonna be like 20fps at max (probably less) and at 4K you won't notice it at all except for some games  So if upscaling matters to you get the 5070 Ti build. If you wanna play at 1080p (which you most likely don't with this system) the 9800X3D could be a big advantage. At 1440p it depends on if better upscaling is worth these ~15fps you're loosing",pcmasterrace,2025-09-08 14:26:06,1

This looks like RAM training, and the training can take quite a while finish especially after a CMOS reset (15+ minutes). If for some reason that it takes longer, you can reboot the system and see if it clears again. You should be able to get it up and running eventually with enough waiting, I highly recommend updating the BIOS for that board especially if the BIOS version is old (like 2024). After this mishap, I updated the BIOS of the MOBO and re-enabled AMD expo and the RAM training went by much faster. If for some reason you aren't able to get to POST even after waiting awhile and rebooting a couple times, I suggest trying to use the BIOS flashback feature on that motherboard to update the BIOS without needing to POST.

If you can get the XT for like 10% more that'd be the way to go and still undevolt it to get efficiency gains. If non- XT is the best value in your place just go for it, it's a very good card.   Surprised me in a lot of titles that nobody tests any more. A widely reported outlier and current AAA title is AC Shadows, non-XT is significantly faster than 3080 but I have seen this sort of outliers in older games, my example is ME Andromeda. I used a specific point in the game to test the most brutal frame rate drops.   Undevolt is a lottery, I was expecting to not be able to go lower than -40, maybe -50 but I've been good at -70 and -100, keeping it at -70 for the moment.

Crazy to think that there is a timeline where amd keeps the price of the 9070 xt at 700 bucks.,AMD,2025-09-03 07:41:55,11
AMD,nc5r0w2,"Why would anyone pick 7800XT over 5060ti at the same price? Only reason if you exclusively play COD. It’s like 10% raster difference, however in real world with DLSS rtx card will be faster and will have better image quality",AMD,2025-09-03 08:32:20,-3

AMD,ncq4rj2,Nearly every tech youtuber has been recommending RDNA4 and yet AMD has lost even more ground to Nvidia in this generation of GPUs.   IMO that and the 5070 being the best selling card of this gen indicates that people are looking at the actual price to performance charts and not outright rejecting 12GB cards just because youtubers want to have 16GB.,AMD,2025-09-06 12:58:50,1
AMD,ncplg94,They need to get it down now that 5070 TI id readily available at MSRP.

AMD,nc5wn3r,They are earning a profit but no one besides AMD or the AIB's know how much since they keep the price they sell to AIB's for the chips secret.

I don't see why people are surprised that the 5070 is doing good, stuff doesn't change in a single generation, especially when one of the competitors holds 85% of the market share, AMD didn't even book the capacity to sell more than the 5070.

With the 9060 XT (16G) at the 369€ MSRP and most custom models around 400€, paying 450 for a 16% faster RX 7800 XT does make sense.

It probably is :(  2. Single monitor: VRAM clocks go to idle, dual monitor with high refresh rate still go to max VRAM. Locking both to 60 Hz brings VRAM back to idle.  3. Forcing Aniso: probably still iffy in DX 10-11-12 and nonexistent in Vulkan. DX 7-8-9 works, OpenGL works.  4. No issues with video hardware acceleration or MPO  5. AMD really, REALLY needs to clean up technology supported games. What games support BOOST? What is happening to the technology?  6. Anti-Lag 2 support is expanding, albeit at a slow rate. This needs encouraged somehow  7. FSR4 for RDNA3 is still officially needed. Unofficially, you know, Linux and also [redacted].  8. FSR4 for Vulkan is still M.I.A.  9. No RIS2 for anything other than RDNA4?  10. We need some more magical driver boosts that help RT / PT. Not realistically possible until DXR 1.2 support and games.  11. AMD should REALLY do an FSR 3.1 / 4 / AL2 plug-in for Unreal Engine 4.25 - 4.26 - 4.27. It might be a tad late and strange now, but games somehow are still releasing with them. Or getting updated: see Hogwarts Legacy.  12. Vulkan GPL might be broken for the past few drivers. DXVK isn't as smooth as DXVK GPLAsync. Needs investigated.",AMD,2025-09-09 15:26:42,2

Back then the game would show about 7300MB VRAM used at startup and it would climb to 8100MB and then the game would became unstable and show Vulkan memory and swapchain errors.

With the latest update the game starts with 8100MB used and never drops below that.

The easiest way to get this done is via [UI for ETW](https://github.com/randomascii/UIforETW), this will automate the installation of the Windows ADK so there's no annoying set up process.  When you launch the app (~/etwpackage1.60/etwpackage/bin/UIforETW.exe), you'll see a checkbox for GPU tracing, please check that and keep it enabled.  With UI for ETW open, please reproduce the issue with video stuttering when not maximised on Brave, click on 'start tracing', let it capture about 5 seconds of stuttery video playback, then hit stop and save (alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+R to start and stop).  You can navigate to the trace file from the GUI by right clicking and opening via explorer. These files can get large pretty quickly but compress well.

AMD,nd5p48c,"That's changes much. If it's present on HDMI and display port (one guy fixed this by changing cable however and installing different driver), with mpo and without, then it will be same as checkerboard issue. There was no other fix than changing this angle thing in browser and disabling hw acceleration else where. But what's totally boggling here is why some doesn't have it, and some does. If that could be config-settings related, its gonna be close to impossible to fix. Checkerboard was present in all machines equipped with Nvidia GPU - this was common, but here.... It may be some driver-firmware of other hardware compatibility that appeared with system update. It may be SAM, ULPS, simply everything.    And with rDNA 2 (6800XT) i had one issue that appeared with later drivers and was never fixed - it was ULPS, but appeared only with display port and only on windows. My display was waking up just to get sleep in regular time periods. To fix this I had to disable ""enableu ULPS"" in registry after every driver update. Every single time. Problem is... Issue was present after swapping to RTX 3080. And there was no ULPS in registry.   After weeks of searching in free time, I found out, this was question of... Compatibility of monitor(display) firmware-system-driver and there is nothing I can do. I got experience with this kind of issues on clients systems, where display firmware is the culprit (usually it's displays from 2017-2020) with no new drivers since 2019 - 2021. After swapping back to 6800XT, seeing this again (but be able to workaround it), I was sure it will happen with my next GPU - 9070XT. But for some unknown reason it's not happening (!?).   So it started on 6800XT, ~ 3 months after purchase, I had no previous GPU (GTX1080ti - sold it), but borrowed old GTX 1060 from my brother setup (pascal gen required firmware update for display port - I applied it) - same here. RTX 3080 - too, next 6800XT from different AiB - same. 9070XT - no issue.

AMD,nd78af0,Kind of. The technologies involved are broad and lean toward improving image quality for the same given inputs rather than optimizing existing ray tracing algorithms.  Neural radiance caching has the potential to improve performance by reducing the number of rays needed for a given scene. Although benefits diminish as the scene becomes more dynamic.  Ray regeneration is more about image quality (noise reduction) but could allow for fewer rays meaning higher performance.  Improved FSR4 is again about image quality but if that lets you run at lower input resolutions then it increases performance.   AI frame generation could mean frame generation (which already exists) just with fewer artifacts. And I expect this is where AMD will allow for greater than 2x frame generation.,AMD,2025-09-09 02:56:35,68

NVIDIA's tensor cores are dedicated, specialized hardware units within each streaming multiprocessor optimized for matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) operations in AI and machine learning workloads, such as DLSS upscaling and neural rendering. These have evolved across generations (e.g., 5th-gen in Blackwell) with support for formats like FP8, sparsity, and high-throughput INT8/FP16 computations.  Instead, AMD's RDNA 4 architecture (powering the Radeon RX 9000 series, launched in early 2025) uses {AI Accelerators} (second-generation in RDNA 4) as its equivalent for AI acceleration. These are not fully standalone ""cores"" like NVIDIA's but integrated into the compute units (CUs) via specialized tensor ALUs and instructions like Wave Matrix Multiply-Accumulate (WMMA). This enables similar matrix operations for tasks like FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), an ML-based upscaling tech that leverages hardware-accelerated FP8 WMMA for improved quality and performance over prior FSR versions.  AMD still does not have dedicated Tensor cores like Nvidia does. They're just AI cores mixed in their Compute Units..

It is really interesting if AMD can deliver a good MFG experience. Nvidia had AI based FG since dlss3(released with 3000 series but worked with 2000 series).  So my initial expectation is that AMD won't do MFG for now but just have quality of FG that compares to Nvidia, most people can't really utilize MFG anyways because you need very high monitor refresh rate(like 165/175 for X3 and 240 for X4). Because it took Nvidia until 5000 series to introduce flip metering which is basically what allows MFG, while also enhancing regular FG.   Though flip metering is mostly a driver level feature it probably requires hardware modifications(upgrades) to deliver the very precise timing needed.   And Nvidia has been doing AI based FG for a long time yet only introduced this feature with 5000 series. If AMD is able to catch up in their first(or second depending on how you view it) AI/ML based gaming GPU, that seems a bit too good to be true imo.",AMD,2025-09-10 06:57:03,-1

Gpus are low priority until they can get better designs.",AMD,2025-09-09 17:27:28,1

Obviously it isn't the same or else all FG tech would have released with multiple frames.   Calling MFG silly just because it needs a high refresh rate monitor is pretty dumb. Yes technologies have limitations. I use it in basically all my singleplayer games(using X3 for 166hz on a 175hz monitor), heck even BF6 2x worked great to give me a stable frame rate and basically eliminate fluctuations.   I've seen so many comparisons over the years fsr FG is really quite close to dlss fg, much more so than upscaling(fsr3.1). But if you slow down the footage it's obviously a lot more garbled and unstable. When I used fsr3 fg(7900xtx) id more or less have to have 65-70 fps for it to feel good. With DLSS fg(5070ti) ~55 is good. But it's hard to compare directly because fsr 3.1 fg is also more performant, but Nvidia has reflex which helps even lower FPS feel better. But no matter how you cut the cookie my FG experience is greater with 5070ti than it was with a 7900xtx.

AMD,ndc22yj,"RT in many implementations is still used often as a hybrid tech and not a full on implementation. It's part of the reason why I unironically think some of the best implementaitons of raytracing are Nvidia's RTX Remix projects on 2 decade+ old games. You have an old game whose game engine is soo lightweight that any modern device will run laps around it for performance, so all of the performance goes straight to raytracing. Even with minimal model and texture modifications, the lighting changes absolutely evolve the game.  I do think its the method that many 360/PS3 era, or late PS2/GC/Xbox era games can be remastered without ruining the original gameplay, without having to fully do a ""remake"" of a game (e.g Oblivion remastered is a minor example).",AMD,2025-09-09 21:04:28,2

Until that issue is somehow solved, I specifically do **not** want RT effects in any game I play.

The technlogy to generate a second frame is not different to the technology to generate the first frame.   >why would AMD not do it?  For any number of reasons. It has limited value, limited uses cases, so probably not a priority compared to other things. But it also requires working with developers to ensure games support it on release.

The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it.

Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Intel,2025-06-27 13:30:56,5

His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly.

Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump.
