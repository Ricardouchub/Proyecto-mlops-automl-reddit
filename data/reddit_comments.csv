Intel,nzdnidn,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",hardware,2026-01-13 16:43:04,6
Intel,nzhfs1m,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",hardware,2026-01-14 04:25:57,1

Intel,nzk72ao,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

Intel,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310.

GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered.

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

At CES, there are surprisingly dGPUs still being paired with Panther Lake, heck, Strix Halo was designed purely for it's iGPU, even the engineers stand by this (PCIe slots are being released in miniPCs because that's what the market wants).  Also, this ""big APU"" argument is based on chiplets/tiles. Strix Halo isn't monolithic, same as Panther Lake. They both have the same design strategy that makes it economically viable to tape out in the first place.  I am not trying to say that STX-H is better than PTL, PTL was like the only thing I was looking forward to at CES, but this whole thread surrounding around how STX-H is a failure doesn't make sense at all.",hardware,2026-01-10 20:05:42,-2

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",hardware,2026-01-07 12:05:46,2

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:47:39,-1
Intel,ntep84w,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",hardware,2025-12-11 03:32:35,4

Intel,nthte2d,"For the use cases of PTL, Geekbench (which is mostly consumer focused) is a good indicator.  It doesn't assume that its workloads are perfectly parallel, it assumes some threads are used more heavily than others, so its value in nT is influenced by its 1T.    If someone is using this for rendering or other highly parallelizable workloads they might want to look into a subtest or into an alternative benchmark, but for typical consumers it seems like Geekbench is a good approximation of their experience.",hardware,2025-12-11 17:03:33,2
Intel,ntckb4u,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress. It would also strongly indicate that Intel’s 18A node indeed offers significantly better energy efficiency than TSMC's N3B.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:22:19,1

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:41:27,-4

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.

Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.  It isn't happening before then however.",hardware,2025-11-17 17:36:51,1

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:17:12,-8

E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",hardware,2025-10-10 19:19:56,-4

Then sell the stick you have now and reap the profits, or keep it for if you ever decide to upgrade in the future to a DDR5 platform. DDR4 is also still just a more stable technology in general in my experience. Older platform boards and chips will also be cheaper than AM5, while still enabling you to build a massively overpowered system for your use case. You can also put that money saved into other things in your life, or into a more powerful GPU like a B580 or 9060XT.  For example, instead of a Ryzen 7600, I'd recommend a 5700 for about the same price. Somewhat slower individual cores, but there are more of them (you're unlikely to notice the difference with the games you play), and your board and RAM will be a lot cheaper (you can also get much better memory than that for the price with DDR4, that DDR5 you have is bottom of the barrel stuff meant for office PCs, not for gaming). A nice Gen 4 SSD isn't too expensive still, and then you can use the difference for a better GPU, or as I mentioned before, to put to use elsewhere.  Also, if you use a good board with a second x16 PCIe slot, you can use that RX480 as a Lossless Scaling frame generation card.

Your old drive is likely on its last legs, and that’s probably what’s killing your internet connection too when the OS hangs.  About the new build: Going AM5 with the 7600 is a smart move. It’s a massive jump. But since you’re buying DDR5, try to get a 6000MHz kit instead of 4800MHz. Ryzen 7000 series really needs that extra speed to shine, and 4800MHz will actually hold your CPU back more than you think.  Also, just a heads-up on the PSU: that CiT FX Pro is pretty bottom-tier. Since you’re buying a nice ROG Strix board and a modern CPU, I’d spend a bit more on a reliable power supply (like a Corsair or Seasonic) just to be safe.  Swap to that RX 480 for now—it’ll definitely beat your 1050 Ti while you save for a modern GPU.

You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0.

This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement.

Intel,o0ntbi2,"Yeah, id get the 14600k then. It's more than fine for a 5080/5070ti.  Yes, Arc runs perfectly as is.  And yes, frame gen has been incredible, honestly. While the messaging about how it's useless when you're below 60fps is accurate, it is actually beautiful if you like having high fps.  For example, in Outer Worlds 2, my FPS in the town area drops to 54-57 fps. However, multi frame gen, gives me a very comfortable high refresh experience. Likewise frame gen in arc raiders, space marine 2, and indiana jones feel really good.  I also have the Lossless scaling app and honestly, Nvidia frame gen is several times better. I remember testing out lossless scaling in several games and the only game where it felt nice was in Kingdom Come Deliverance 1. However, in games like helldivers, the input lag was very noticable even if you had 60fps base.  Here's another amazing part about 5000 series. Smooth motion. I discovered it only recently and if you weren't aware, its the driver side implementation of frame gen. With the nvidia app, I can turn it on in almost any game, including old ones like control and games like Enshrouded which dont come with any frame gen.  let me tell you, even this driver level frame gen is so much better than lossless scaling. I was recording benchmarks with my 12400f yesterday just so that I can have a comparison when I make the switch and something funny happened. I was playing helldivers and was wondering why I was getting 120 fps. I had remembered it being 60fps earlier. For a moment, I thought my CPU had become unthrottled or that a mew patch had droppeed with massive fps improvements. However, I suddenly realized that I had simply enabled smooth motion earlier. It's legit like native 120 fps and I didnt even realize it.  Of course, dont' expect it to make 60fps feel nice if you only have 30fps (Thankfully, that will never happen right now with this tier of cards as even Path tracing on cp2077 gives me like 55fps). However, who knows what magic nvidia will cook up next. Dynamic frame gen might be super interesting to try in spring as well.  I was this close to actually getting a 9070xt. However, after experiencing frame gen, both native and driver level, and now the new and improved dlss4.5, im so glad I trusted my gut and went Nvidia. It came at a massive price here in India as well (like $965) but when im dropping big money on a card, Id rather get the best feature set than save what is a negligble amount in the context of the  4-5 years I will be using the card.      I am only envious of the dudes with DDR5 memory because that adds a good 20% extra performance in a ton of games apparently. But I guess it's not good to be too greedy haha.",buildapc,2026-01-20 13:14:40,1

Is there much difference between the like 4600kf and like 14700?

Intel,o07z7s0,"The ""f"" indicator on the CPUs means that it's a version with the internal graphics chip disabled, which is generally not a problem if you're going to have a dedicated GPU, and shouldn't effect performance.  The ""k"" indicator means that the CPU has a higher max power draw, and that it's unlocked for overclocking. To overclock, you also need a Z-series motherboard. The higher max power draw does mean that even with your B-series board, the ""k"" CPU will be able to run slightly faster than the ""non-k"" variant of the same CPU, usually translating to around ~5% more performance in real world scenarios.   The 14700k(f) is 0-10% faster at most vs the 14600k(f) in gaming workloads, depending on the game, so the 14700 non-k would be even less of a difference vs the 14600k(f). There's generally no reason to go for a non-k variant over the k variant if it's not cheaper, and the same goes for the f CPUs. In the UK, it looks like the 14600 non-k is not available anymore from major retailers, and the 14600kf is about £20 cheaper than the 14600k, so probably worth saving the money with the f model in your case.  I usually use this as a quick reference for power supply requirements with CPU + GPU combinations: https://www.msi.com/blog/recommended-psu-table  You can see that for an Intel i7 CPU with the RTX 5080, they indicate that an 850w PSU should be fine if you aren't looking to overclock, so as long as your PSU is a good quality 850w, I wouldn't worry about the power draw.   On the other hand, the 5080 uses Nvidia's new 12pin HPWR connector, which requires an (included) adapter to be used with older PSUs. This connector has a pretty bad reputation for pulling power unevenly and *melting* if the connections are not secure, so most people advise to use power supplies with native 12pin HPWR connectors if possible, to avoid extra points of failure. If you're careful (or if your PSU has these connectors natively - it's usually indicated on the box as ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1), then it *shouldn't* be an issue, but these connectors are very finicky, so people are usually quite cautious about them.   The only other thing to note is that DDR4 does tend to effect the performance of these CPUs vs DDR5, which can range quite a bit depending on the game, with a few edge-cases actually running better on good quality DDR4 (games that prefer memory latency vs speed). This also effects 12th and 13th gen CPUs, so the performance differences between CPUs will still be the same in a relative sense, when both are using DDR4.",buildapc,2026-01-18 02:30:20,1
Intel,o08asy3,"Thank you so, so sooo much <3 you are literally the best person ever, thank you  As for F, looking on the sites in the UK they generally seem to be around the same price as non F, so in that case I think I will grab a none F just in case of like, a gpu issue. Similar with K, the K are only marginally more expensive so I would definitely go with that over a none k.  As for 14700k vs 14600k, the 14700k is about £100 more than the 600, does that justify the price enough? The only other thing I can think of is for the 14600k the only version in stock for me is the F version (the others are all out of stock), so it's around £200 for 14600kf and like £320 for the 14700k.

But as far as straight raster at 1080p, a 1080ti is still (rip driver support) more than capable...especially since you can run fsr3 on it if you need a fps boost.

Explanation: (I'm assuming you have a good CPU and a 144hz monitor at least.)  In terms of raw raster power, which is mostly what is required in a badly optimized game like CS2, the 9070XT shines. You will notice a consistently ""smoother"" gameplay when gaming at higher resolutions since those 1% lows will hit hard and often ingame. In my experience the frequent drops in fps are mostly what affects performance and responsiveness, and why CS2 feels sluggish and inconsistent sometimes.       If however you're gaming at 4:3 the extra VRAM will not matter as you will consistently have more than 144 fps in any scenario, which matches your monitor's refresh rate (or 240 fps if you have a good cpu and a higher refresh monitor). So 5070 and 9070XT will have the same performance at 4:3 aspect ratio.  For what it's worth, I have the 5070 and my main game is CS2, no issues whatsoever at 4:3 1280x960. I also play other games at 1440p most at Max/High settings with no issues whatsoever. The 5070 is more than enough for your needs imo.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-23 00:26:35,2

Hate to say it, but ultimately, I looked at the plugs, kept seeing issues with users having that cursed 12VHPWR fail.

Cable routing was more inconvenient.  Sold it to a friend that didn't care about all that. He got a card right after his older card died, and I was able to move onto the card I really was targeting (bought the 5070 in February).  If my purpose/wishes required a 5080 or even 5090, then I might have taken my chances long-term on relying on that 12VHPWR as a necessary evil/risk.

The extra 4GB would definitely be useful for down the road or other games and I have not had any driver issues with mine, but cannot guarantee your experience will be the same.   If you do choose Nvidia, I would suggest the ti for the extra VRAM. Understand as well that some people do still have driver issues. Due to the nature of the internet and fanboyism, I really couldn’t tell you if it is actors frequent or not. It may have to do with specific settings or configurations. But positives. The game you claim you play exclusively is optimized for Nvidia as you can see by the performance boost. Nvidia software and features are indeed more robust and proven. They are at least one generation ahead of AMD with RT, PT and upscaling tech. Don’t bother with frame generation in CS2 it adds input lag.   In short go with the one that fits your budget that you have enough confidence in. It will be in your system. Most people here will pick one brand or the other and try to say it is the only choice.

That said, the better option is whichever you find cheaper, which is most likely going to be the 9070XT. At the same price, I'd go with the 9070 XT.  Both GPUs perform at a similar level, with variations depending on the game. In general, the 9070 XT performs slightly better, sitting in between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti. But there are specific cases in which the 9070 XT can fall below both, and others where it can rise above both.  The main actually notable advantage of the 9070 XT is the higher VRAM capacity.  The main actually notable advantage of the RTX 5070 is DLSS being better than FSR.

But absolutely I think some people just glossed over that Nvidia had genuinely terrible drivers fairly consistently for the bulk of 2025. With some of the highlights being the early Blackwell drivers being unstable so the pro strat was using pre-launch drivers from iirc December 2024 that didn't support multi frame gen and maybe DLSS4 in general.  That one specific driver that would set custom fan curves to 0RPM at all temps and cooked multiple GPUs to the point of needing to be RMA'd. Which while it did get hotfixed like a full day later, that was A. still long enough we saw multiple reports of broken cards and B. they weirdly didn't force the update or heavily promote on social media or anywhere to tell people to do the update. So if you were out of loop which some people were, we still saw a few more cooked GPUs drip feed in days after it was fixed.  And the Doom the Dark Ages ""Game Ready Drivers"" that literally in the patch notes first block of text ""Documented crashes when playing Doom the Dark Ages"". The game ready drivers literally weren't game ready.  And just in general stretches of weeks to months of bad drivers consecutively that led to people basically constantly having to check in on which specific driver versions were ""safe"" to update to and when to stay on version for long periods of time before updating. It was at least half of 2025 if not three quarters of it that Nvidia had questionable drivers. Meanwhile AMD's drivers were probably the most stable they'd been in a while for the bulk of 2025, including the launch day drivers for RDNA4 were weirdly just good. They did have the advantage of the delayed RDNA4 launch but day 1 9070 and 9070XT drivers seemed to just kinda work.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-22 17:58:44,2

Then you got that annoying niggle in the back of your mind, that you messed up, and now are you going to live with it, or take a small hit and get what you actually should have.  To give one example, would be people claiming card can play 1440P/4K, when they can probably play those res at Mid setting to an acceptable FPS, or only on older games. And example would be all the people claiming a B580/9060XT 16GB does well at 1440P, when they honestly don't, unless you are playing some older games/less intensives games (Or want to play 1440p with a mix of low-high setting and get a barely stable 60 FPS on more intensives games with upscaler).  or the people who loved to claim a 4070TI was a 4K card. New builder may also get confused with benchmarkers using a 7800X3D/9800X3D to test a budget and mid tier card, not understanding the CPU is helping it's performance and a mid tier CPU will produce different results. Games also get patches which cause worse performance. You could end up watching an old benchmark, from maybe even 3-9 months ago, and get a false idea of what the GPU can do in the game you plan to mostly play. E.G: Tekken 8 released and the min GPU to play FSR 2 Ultra performance low/mid was a 1050TI, after a few patches (\~9 months) it was a 1660TI, nowadays 18+ months on, it can barely run on a 2060S at min setting. This was across the board, a 4070 was producing worse results at older settings and you had to crank down the res and/or setting. ETC ETC. There's a lot of reason why people end up slightly upgrading after they bought, even if they have done the research.  A lot of people on this sub, also don't help, people have mad copium and love to inflate the performance of their GPUs.

I don’t wanna question if I need to use optiscaler for upscaling, or question if they’ll treat my card like the $1000 7900XTX and make it obsolete after a year or two. All those things I have to question buying into AMD, but not Nvidia and for most enthusiasts it’s worth the premium.   Hell, I had people saying to buy a 9060XT with worse RT, Software, less raster by like 35% over a 5070 for nothing but 4GB VRAM extra.

And seeing the RAM situation I don’t expect vram demands to increase at a normal pace during some years, I’m expecting stagnantion since, even if AMD says so, I highly doubt they’ll be able to mantain prices.  Maybe for half a year but eventually they’ll have to buy more Vram and prices are through the roof. High vram GPUs will be very expensive for some years now.

Intel,o11dccl,"I'll be honest mate, I agree with you. I personally only think an upgrade is worth it when you get a 20%+ performance increase. Like I've myself have battled with getting a 7800X3D when they go on sale (best sale I saw was \~$250 about 6ish months ago, was so hard not to pull the trigger), since the performance uplift from a 7600X, in CPU intensive games I play (strat games) isn't enough. Sadly I have an asrock board, pre-9XXXX release, and yeah with their issues with a 9800X3D, it isn't an option for me...  But you can sell a brand new GPU, esp a 5070, for a minor lose (ESP right now). And get a 9070XT. It isn't dropping $700+. It's dropping the difference of what you got used for your old GPU and the price of the new one. That could be $0-100, to get the GPU you wish you had got from the start. Which isn't too bad to many. AMD card also sell for cheaper used, it isn't that hard to sell a used Nvidia card and get an AMD card from the same gen, used, for almost the same price. Not long ago, I sold a 4070TI and got a Used 7900XTX and had some money to spare/made a profit. I wanted to play 4K and the 4070TI wasn't cutting it. I also got an amazing deal on a 2 week old 7900XTX, seller wanted better RT performance for Cyberpunk, and got a 9070XT.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-22 12:49:24,1
Intel,o170k9g,"Sure and I totally agree but they seem quite clear about just playing this game and I think something to highlight would be that they can save a bit of money by getting the 5070. It’s also going to be viable for other games of course it will, more than that they seem to be playing at 1080p for this particular game so I would suspect that they probably have a 1080p monitor and at that resolution you really don’t need a 9070 XT. I don’t know if CS2 is going to get updated with this, but Nvidia is also doing their reflex 2 framewarp which no one seems to know when it’s coming out, but if you are a competitive gamer, it’s probably a big deal. Honestly, I’m fascinated by the whole argument because it seems ridiculous to me to buy any of these modern midrange cards in order to play one game, but if that’s what OP wants to do, I guess it is.   They seemingly don’t show any interest in other games if they did the 9070 XT is obvious the better choice but that’s still overkill for a 1080p monitor where I do think that a 5070 is more reasonably specced with 12 gigs of VRAM going very far at that resolution and the performance being respectable. You should likely be able to play everything at like ultra settings and have a good experience on a 1080p monitor.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-23 06:29:14,1
Intel,o12daa5,"I don't disagree that Nvidia has better features, but we've reached a point where AMD is catching up, which over a year ago wasn't even close.  FSR 3 was below DLSS 2, while FSR4 is somewhere between DLSS 3 and 4.  You get AMD if in your region you want a midrange card that's the best bang for buck possible, if it's priced correctly.  I disagree with the 7900 XTX being obsolete, you bought it before FSR 4 was a thing, in my opinion it still performs exactly the same. Perhaps some expected it to get a better upscaler, but even this is speculation.  Both Nvidia and AMD have been known to release new features only for their new cards. However AMD open source more, if it wasn't for them we'd still be paying for modules in monitors for G-Sync.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-22 15:55:14,5

Intel,o11ucvy,"And yet AMD has better price to performance ratio in almost all games. While I agree nvidias AI features are better, the difference is not as big as it used to be. FSR4 is vastly superior to FSR3. Antilag (2) is also a very good option to Reflex, I've actually noticed a bigger difference than I did with reflex, but it does not work properly in every game, so some tradeoff there.   FSR does have less support in new/old games, but any major new release always has FSR in my experience.   Day one driver support being better on Nvidia isn't really relevant when they still have a lot of issues with games not fully utilizing the nvidia cards, and this has a big problem this last or two year for nvidia. You simply don't need day one driver support on AMD for most games. There's been numerous games where the 50XX series has had worse performance than the 40XX series in new games even with day 1 drivers.

People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card.

Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $550 today. So depending on how you want to compare prices, that's roughly on par with requiring an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 Super for a game released in 2025.

If the city was let's say 100K, it's gonna be bigger which means more things to load which means more VRAM used which means potentially maxxing out the VRAM of my GPU.  Also if you didn't know this, maxxing out the VRAM of a GPU is not preferable as it brings stutters. That's why 8gigs of VRAM is not seen as enough these days.

If you are very patient in trafic you could tolerate driving with all 1000 bricks at once, but most of us would rather carry fewer bricks and drive faster.

Intel,o0gqiq7,"That's not how it works. Increasing resolution doesn't inherently take load off the CPU. What actually reduces CPU load is lowering the number of frames the system is trying to produce. When you raise the resolution and the GPU can't render as many frames, CPU load will drop as a side effect, but that's due to the reduced framerate, not the resolution increase itself.  If you cap the FPS to, say, 60 at both 1080p and 4K (assuming the GPU can handle both), the CPU workload will be the same. The CPU's job is tied to how many frames it has to prepare, not the resolution those frames are rendered at. When you're CPU limited, it means the processor is already producing as many frames as it can. Raising the resolution won't magically allow it to produce more frames, it just risks shifting you into a GPU bottleneck instead.

Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",AMD,2026-01-01 22:29:53,2

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears.

I've tried the following things in order to try solve the mentioned issue:  * Reinstall the GPU drivers of my laptop. * Pull the HDMI cable out of the HDMI port on my USB-C hub and then plug it in again.  Regrettably these things I tried didn't solve the issue so now my question is how I can solve the refresh rate drop issue when my laptop is connected to the Gigabyte M027Q28G.  Thanks for your help in advance lastly! :)",AMD,2026-01-20 20:17:48,1

I don't use a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but the maximum operating temperature (Tjmax) for the 7800X3D is 89°C. If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.

Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.

Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,o15856l,"Most of the conversations happened across various discord servers, so I cannot directly link them, but I also found a few posts here on reddit that seem to point towards the same direction which roughly match with the timeframe.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct\_mode\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct_mode_not_working/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr\_crashing\_on\_amd\_drivers\_after\_2451\_direct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr_crashing_on_amd_drivers_after_2451_direct/)  It's a bit odd because if you set the flag beforehand with a older version and then update to newer versions, Directmode still works fine, but if you fully remove the drivers with AMD's driver removal utility or Display Driver uninstaller (which propably deletes some cached driver file for directmode, is my guess), Directmode disables fully and can't turn on anymore at all.      As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.  I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.  But I do think that it is a fairly reproducable problem, at least on my end, it happened across two different systems.",AMD,2026-01-23 00:00:34,3
Intel,o16r403,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",AMD,2026-01-23 05:17:40,1

For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch.

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",AMD,2025-11-14 05:48:36,2

Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,19
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.

(I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services.

Because it absolutely does work as intended with Arc. Arc's VRR is based on VESA's adaptive sync, like Freesync and G-sync compatible also are.  As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

Intel,lenkqpy,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,67

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.

So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

Intel,kxiah6c,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

AMD,o12knv5,"While it's probably part of it, I doubt it's the whole story. Windows has basically been the ""worse GUI that you put up with"" for 40 years, so it continuing to be that shouldn't be that dramatic.  I think a bigger explanation is just cost. While the entry price for MacBooks hasn't moved much on paper, the entry-level MacBooks throughout the 10's were generally not ideal, and you generally wanted to go up the product ladder to get a better laptop if you could afford it, even for general usage, and once you were looking at the laptop you actually wanted, you were spending $2000 or more. That's an inherently limited audience, simply due to cost.  These days, the cheapest MacBook you can buy is extremely solid and has no major asterisks. The price of ""I want a MacBook with a high-resolution screen, a processor that's as fast as the most premium processors on the market for tasks that only need a couple of cores, and has enough RAM/storage that I don't have to worry about it"" dropped by well over $1000 in the last six years, in addition to the massive technological upgrades in new hardware generations (e.g. Coffee Lake to M4).  Notably, there hasn't been a similar cost proposition improvement on the Windows side over the same time, dramatically shifting the relative cost proposition between MacBooks and Windows laptops. This creates a massive problem for Windows, as the whole reason to put up with the ""worse GUI that you put up with"" was generally cost, as boxes that ran Windows were generally meaningfully cheaper than Microsoft's competitors over the years (Mac, OS/2, early UNIX). With MacBooks being competitive or even favorable on cost compared to nice Windows laptops, the incentive to put up with Windows anyway is just gone.",hardware,2026-01-22 16:28:20,15

AMD,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance.

[Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

AMD,o0nam6q,"Well, you got a point, I phrased that badly.   No, HPL is a politically motivated benchmark with zero applicability in the real world that causes real harm to the HPC world and is horrendously expensive to run.    If you're interested in this, here is a slightly longer explanation (It's a slightly modified copy paste from a different explanation from me, so some things might seem a bit off to you)  It was created to ""prove"" performance claims by manufactures. Back in the day even CPUs had a claimed theoretical max performance, usually in GFLOPS. But what does it even mean and where does this number come from? It tells you how many floating point operations (typically 64 bit) a processor can theoretically do. It's calculated by core count \* clockspeed \* fp operations per cycle. So, it tells you how many operations the CPU can do if every single clock cycle was used to calculate as many operations as theoretically possible per cycle. For modern CPUs, lets use a 7950X as an example: It has 16 cores, runs at a base frequency of 4.5GHz, has two 256 vector ALUs and supports FMA (fused multiply add, performs two operations in one cycle), so it's two operations per cycle on 8 (2x 256bit = 8x 64bit) FP per core on 16 cores 4.5G times per second. So 4.5 x 16 x 8 x 2 = 1152GFLOPS. The same math applies to GPUs where the performance claim is usually still marketed.   HPL is a benchmark that was created to get as close as possible to this number. It's designed to minimize overhead, memory, networking etc, and use 100% speedup from wider vector units etc. And not only that, every single manufacturer has their own optimized HPL version. On intel CPUs you run an intel optimized version on AMD an AMD optimized version etc. To get back to the example, [here](https://wp-cdn.pugetsystems.com/2022/08/hpl-zen4.png) is a test from puget systems with a result of 1011GFLOPS which means a \~87% efficiency.    And that's basically the thing, the more time you spend optimizing, the closer you get to the optimum which is about 85-95% of theoretical maximum. And not only that, if you spend enough time optimizing and distributing load, you can even throw in a GPU and add the performance to the total performance. It's essentially just about how much time you're willing to invest into it.   The problem is, none of that translates into any real world performance. This [chart](https://www.pugetsystems.com/pic_disp.php?id=68180) shows how random many results seem to be (intel dominates there because of their early AVX 512 adoption). In the real world, especially in HPC the software is far more complex and more I/O, network and memory dependent than pure compute bound.    There isn't a single common HPC workload that scales with performance as HPL does, none.   The benchmark exists for the top500 list and to ""validate"" the performance claims. It's for politics, to be able to say ""our supercomputer is faster than yours"".",hardware,2026-01-20 10:57:21,3

AMD,o0nape6,"(2/2 I hit the comment length limit)  And that's where the problem starts. I did work at a super computer place at a time where they were looking for a new system. Because most scientific super computers are paid by the state/city/whatever and it's a political thing, HPL is a real problem because politicians want to see results and they only care about HPL and where it lands in the top 500 list.   Thing is that running HPL is horrendously expensive. If you want good results you can easily spend like 2-4 weeks on optimizing and benchmarking, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize that if a supercomputer is used for 5 years, that's 1-2% of the whole lifetime and therefore cost.   Next problem is that GPUs are still not that great in HPC and a lot still runs on CPUs for many different reasons. The place I worked at had zero uses for GPUs as their main software had no GPU support. They had some, mostly for analyzing results (and visualization) that was purely built on CUDA. But GPUs offer like 10x the performance in HPL compared to a CPU socket and are far more cost effective.   But money came from politics and they didn't want a rather small uplift (plans were to spend a lot on networking and storage) and therefore they had to buy some GPU racks and spend less on storage and CPU nodes. And because AMD GPUs were faster at that time in HPL, there was pressure to buy AMD GPUs (which they didn't but they bought a lot of nvidia GPUs).   I can't speak for all supercomputers but at least to me it's not surpring how much more successful AMD is with their datacenter GPUs in the Top500 list (which AMD likes to say for marketing reasons).

Same thing with Ray reconstruction. Complicated tasks just require far more compute.  **Edit:** Preset M = P and Preset L = UP are just what NVIDIA recommend and the NVIDIA App default overrides.

Could more complicated activation functions that wouldn't work on low precision hardware but could do more obviate the need for lower precision neural network acceleration hardware?  Maybe, but no one is really looking into that. architecturally, it's dead simple to add fp4 to hardware compared to paying for the research for alternatives, tensor cores in general are dead simple architectural improvements compared to almost anything else on the GPU stack.   Nvidia added sparse tensor operations in ampere, found that their models didn't need half their values and they could be re-trained with out half the nodes and perform about as well.

Not only does FSR4 predict kernels which are perfectly reasonable with FP8 but part of how FSR4's architecture works is by using clever reprojection tricks to reproject state information into the network to give it longer history. This sounds like a very well informed design trying to maximise a small CNN.

AMD,o1h8lto,"Thank you for this info. I've edited post to avoid spreading misinformation and speculation.  I don't think just Redditors and Tech netizens are to blame. You can look at how NVIDIA marketed CNN vs ViT from the original DLSS4 transformer Geforce blog posts. Could be summed up as :   \- CNN = tile by tile basis/myopic and really poor tracking of dependencies over time and across frame   \- Transformer = analysis entire frame and excellent tracking of dependencies over time and across frame.  I think another reason why most people thought it was transformer was that IIRC FSR4 is even more demanding to run than Preset K and J despite using FP8. People could not conceive of a CNN model running this poorly when NVIDIA CNN models run fast, but then again didn't Sony's PSSR also have serious issues with performance overhead?   Maybe this is a FSR4 and Ray regeneration are both early beta releases. But regardless of what you think it's clear NVIDIA has the lead in terms of talent and design. AMD and everyone else is fighting an uphill battle against DLSS fs.  That's interesting. Yes the FRS4 INT8 leaked model seems pretty solid overall.  No I doubt it. AMD isn't disclosing anything.

AMD,o1hlgfx,"Not trying to be pedantic, sorry for all the edits 😅 I was very curious about FSR4 model too, all these upscalers exist with a gulf in knowledge about their architecture! Ended up falling down a rabbit hole on relearning how FSR2 worked. The black box of it all makes it very frustrating and ends up in semantics war.  NVIDIA are right with their marketing, it seems CNN models are often augmented with help from motion vectors to avoid needing to learn motion reprojection (FSR4 does it, and so did [DLSS 2](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/)). I'm guessing the transformer model is able to learn this itself and that's why it's so much sharper and handles animated textures better. It's not that the sentiment is wrong, just it's not indicative one way or another - DLSS3 got very far with a CNN and FSR4 is (imo) better yet. What AMD has achieved combining a lightweight model with previous FSR insights is very impressive and isn't any less impressive if it's not transformer based.  I would be very curious to know why DLSS is faster - despite its additional complexity, it definitely is faster, but AMD claim otherwise. Their listed performance figures are [optimistic](https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fsr_sdk/techniques/super-resolution-ml/#performance), if those numbers could be achieved that would've been very impressive. Less than DLSS4, more than DLSS3.5 which is somewhere near where the model visually performs. Wonder if there's some overhead and the actual FSR4 passes do genuinely run that quickly. Regardless I would hope that AMD can upgrade to a more modern model, they should have the compute for it! Maybe the software stack isn't there yet.  I really hope they are at least experimenting with transformers. It does seem like despite no public information, many of these upscaling models end up following practices set by NVIDIA. I would love to see a competent RR alternative but we all remember how the CNN variant looked 🫠  Edit: forgot that FSR4 already uses FP8, wonder how much compute is left if they used a bigger model..",hardware,2026-01-24 20:13:39,2

And of course the AdamW (or modern Muon) would be the most bit sensitive part where you’re doing learning at fp32, before QAT.  Tell me more about basic bit count knowledge?  There are bitnet models that literally just use 3 values: -1, 0, 1. Those are 1.58 bits per parameter. You realize everyone knows the direction of the neuron matters a lot more than the amount?

With RR ViT they also said they used FP8 to train the model. I assume they repeated that with DLSS 4.5, so the new model is 100% FP8, no FP16 it seems.  NVFP4 could still work, it's not regular FP4 or MXFP4, yes there's a bit of overhead but it gets very close in accuracy to FP8, so NVIDIA might still opt to use it for DLSS5 training.  The idea is interesting and might be the kind of paradigm shift that can provide us with another DLSS 3.7 -> DLSS 4 increase in image quality.

AMD,o1i1s0g,"No worries. If anyone is pedantic then it's me xD  That's very interesting and I would be interested to see how it would handles a purely driver based implementation (Like NIS, except with preset L).  AMD's claims are wrong. You can look at the percentage wise performance scaling of upscalers in Hardware Unboxed's 9070XT review. DLSS4 is superior in IQ (but like you said it beats DLSS 3.7) and ms overhead.  IIRC FSR4 generally is a lot softer than DLSS4 being much closer to DLSS 3.7. That might be an indication of it not being ViT but this is just a guess. But DLSS3.7 -> DLSS 4.5 is almost like a glasses on vs off situation in many games in terms of motion clarity.   Yes that seems odd but doubt we'll understand why that is.  Hmm. IDK but the MB number for 4K are roughly the same as (within 10MB) as preset J and K despite using FP8. If I extrapolate preset J and K numbers based on 40/50 -> 20/30 series MB scaling DLSS preset J and K could sit at \~230MB.   Now this means very little if it's not the same architecture and even if it is as we've seen with Preset L, M, and RR those have the same MB footprint but wildly different ms overhead. So this is probably a waste of time.  Also as a side note you can see here just how efficient the old DLSS CNN model is. [https://www.studocu.com/en-gb/document/middlesex-university-london/games-fundamentals-2/dlss-programming-guide-release/120964782](https://www.studocu.com/en-gb/document/middlesex-university-london/games-fundamentals-2/dlss-programming-guide-release/120964782)   \- Sorry for link but can't find old download on Github + internet archive won't load it.   Footprint at 4K is \~200MB and 2080 TI and 3070 ms cost from CNN to Preset J/K is more than doubled, and roughly doubled for the rest of the cards. Now I do know that FSR4 is generally in between DLSS 3.7 and DLSS4, but getting a model inferior to DLSS4 that runs with a higher cost despite using FP8 is def not a situation where AMD wants to lay back and be complacent. They still have a lot of work ahead of themselves and it'll only get worse nextgen when NVIDIA moves the goal post yet again.",hardware,2026-01-24 21:31:02,2
AMD,o1j96u9,"> Do you suspect FP8 + moving from logarithmic to linear space is the culprit behind some of the image quality regressions we've seem with DLSS 4.5?  I do not believe so, but I may be wrong.  In my opinion this is likely just due to training.    Basically every model upgrade Nvidia tries to address issues where people have had problems in specific games.  For example, they might notice many people are complaining about ghosting from small particle effects and the like.  So in addition to making models larger/more powerful, they throw in more datasets meant to correct that specific deficit when they train their new models.  But there's no guarantee that each model is going to be able to produce the same results with out regression.  So any new training could change the model causing regressions, and training for specific scenarios could shift weights in ways that may mess up another area.  There's not really any specific way they can fix this beyond training more, this is just an inherent problem with up-scaling using AI.     In theory they have some sort of model testing system to find these kinds of regressions, but it's impossible to account for every single scenario, networks aren't procedural algorithms, so they can fail in unexpected/unpredictable ways.   FP4, and smaller representations will probably lead to larger networks with better quality in the same amount of space if Nvidia chooses to use them, my point though was research in ML in general has been myopic and focused on the lowest hanging fruit to the neglect of other plausible avenues of making more compact neural networks.",hardware,2026-01-25 01:11:18,3

Imagine it being the opposite of the situation when nvidia couldn't keep 3090s on the shelf. They were probably selling the worst possible qualifying chip as a 3090 to maximize profits. So if you got a 3080 it was probably the worst of the worst lol.   This case would be the opposite if demand for the 9070xt was so weak (compared to 9070 sales) that they started selling the good chips as 9070s to move them.

I don't doubt in my mind both GPUs got outsold by the 5070 and 5070ti but I also have seen that's hard to get actual numbers from Steam so we don't know. But I imagine some percent of that 2+% of ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" are 9070XTs, I'm pretty sure they sold more than 0 9070XTs.  Reminder when the RX480/RX580 were priced against like 2GB 60 series Nvidia GPUs while having 4 times the VRAM and nearly double the performance for the same money they still got outsold like 5 to 1 by the Nvidia GPUs. And this is a pre-RT and upscaling era so none of the bells and whistles/software suite type features would be a reason either. So even in situations where an AMD card is just flat out better in every way, it still usually gets outsold hand over fist, so in situations where it's debatable or worse it's an even wider margin.",hardware,2026-01-18 00:15:04,15

I haven’t gotten around to use this PC much so far, perhaps 50-75 hours total turned on of which maybe 15-20 hours were more demanding gaming, the rest was pretty much only idling/desktop usage.

Yet over tens of thousands of people still got burned by it, the number of 12VHPWR burnt cards steadily going through repair shops is mind boggling because they often will have the warranty denied.

Having to treat the cable as if it was made of paper because it can't be bent, or angled, or tugged on, or pulled because it messes up the pin alignment is a joke. People that ran 4090's for years without problem do a board swap, or a rebuild, or just carry the thing outside to dust it and the cable isn't positioned straight when they lock the side panel closed and it's all over for their GPU. It's an inexcusable design when a slight bend in the cable can disrupt pin connections in a way to cause the entire connector to fail. People could abuse the hell out of PCIe 6pin and 8pin cables, even bend them at 180 degrees to hide them and it was safe to do so.   At least when AMD's CPUs die mysterious deaths AMD is graciously and expediently warrantying them. But you'd have to buy more than a half-dozen 9800X3Ds to equal the cost of a 5090 today.

AMD,o0aruti,"The feedback exists for the GPUs, outlets like GN reported information from AIBs as well as etailers and repair shops each, and all three indicated a significant increase in returns, warranties, and GPUs with burnt connectors in for repair.   The 1.10 factor safety margin on the cable has been calculated to the nth degree by almost every youtube hardware channel.    No alternative exists to the 5090. Even the 4090 now costs more than a 5090, and the 9070 XT doesn't even match a 4080.   I'd love to buy something not from NVIDIA, and absolutely something not using 12VHPWR, but I'm not going to invest in a card that's underpowered for what I need, has too little VRAM, and especially one that has a shorter warranty period. On average I buy a flagship card and then keep it for 6-8 years to get the value back out of it, my last was a 1080 Ti that I would've kept on using except a forced monitor upgrade to 4K was too much for it to handle. So don't get me wrong, I own a 4090 and I treat the thing like it's a glass explosive. I also use an ASRock board for my 7700X and wouldn't even consider swapping it for any other brand. I'll agree the AMD issues seem to be very minimal, but there simply is no excuse for the 12VHPWR thing. As per denied warranties I've read about the occasional one, but I have no idea how prevalent it is. In the Brother Zhang repair shop video Zhang mentions people are sending his shop burnt cards because they were outside warranty or because they were imports (such as from Taiwan) and so they couldn't make use of the warranty that the card had.",hardware,2026-01-18 14:57:33,1

HCI and Karhu are pretty comparable when it comes to results, though Karhu runs significantly faster and feels like a more finished product. Karhu 2.0 is also coming out pretty soon which looks even better.  I have not tried OCCT for memory testing, though I do use it for GPU and CPU stress testing. I do not like that you basically have to subscribe to their Patreon for $6 per month if you want to run tests longer than an hour, whereas Karhu it is a one time payment of like $10.   HCI's Memtest pro is just a wrapper for the free version of Memtest that runs several instances of it at a time, so really you can do that all manually yourself.

The major stutters that were happening while textures load from a **1.5TB 5400 HDD** storage drive are gone. There are some micro stutters still but those are tolerable given the age of the system.  The 2022 Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (TTW) via STEAM running at 1080p LOW/MED/FSR 2.0 mix gets ***88+ FPS*** on the in-game benchmark...on ***Linux*** of all things! It's all in the settings mix. Been keeping me entertained even though it clearly is slower than my Ryzen 5 5600/B580 LE build that runs TTW at 1080p ULTRA with 95+ FPS. Even managed to undervolt the RX 470 by 243 mV to jump from 82+ FPS to the current 88+ FPS.  Another test just completed is that with a Linux distro and an AMD GPU that has no hardware ray tracing support (i.e., the RX 470 8GB), it is possible to have ***software emulation ray tracing***. Ran Little Nightmares Enhanced (STEAM) on 1080p ULTRA with HIGH Ray Tracing (the lowest available RT option) and got 10-20 FPS...unplayable...*BUT* with FSR Balanced turned on, then got 40-50 FPS that is totally playable.

So, if a RX 470 8GB can do all this with an E3-1270 v2...a 14 year-old CPU...with your 5500, the 470 certainly will be able to too.  The only caveat is don't overpay for that RX 470 8GB. Check recent Sold listing prices on eBay to gauge.

I wish they would also pay attention to other productivity stuff tho, like using their GPU for rendering in Blender is still a lot slower than the spec suggested, thus there is a potential for more optimization.

AMD does not directly benefit from people having this software on their computer in any way. All of these are for running AI locally on your own hardware. You do not pay for any cloud compute or transfer any data to AMD. They make zero money by bundling these apps for you.  So why are they doing this? It's stupid, but the point of this is to let people know that these things now work hassle free on AMD cards. One of the many things they lagged behind Nvidia in other than upscaling, ray tracing and all that was local AI.   Getting something like ComfyUI working on Nvidia was as simple as downloading it and installing it. It just worked out of the box.

Sure, Nvidia does have a couple generations of it available, but these were (and are) prohibitively expensive, so it's not exactly a point against AMD.

It's really not that bad. I have a 7800 XT and with Z-Image-Turbo I can generate a 1536x2048 image in under a minute. Not as fast as an Nvidia card, sure, but still pretty damn fast for an image of that resolution. Flux.2 Klein-4b edits images in under 10 seconds for me. Would an Nvidia card make it even faster?

It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.

AMD,o0vjpnt,"TLDR: me too, don't know why, at least now I see I am not the only one  Edit: I also disabled MPO as one of my last changes, and that might have helped the most.  System: Intel i5 12400, 32GB ddr4 ram, 1000W psu, Asus TUF RX 9070. Nothing overclocked. Default Adrenaline settings. Main display: 1920x1080@240hz Second display: 2560x1440@60hz  I've had this issue since I first installed my rx 9070. It's been driving me crazy, being new to AMD after a long time made me think it was just me. I never had this happen before on my system, so when the only change was replacing my gtx 1060, it didn't make sense. Went through it all, replaced the PSU, clean windows installs, new and old driver reinstalls, stress testing my system(showed no issues), changing bios settings etc. Even reseated RAM and GPU, replugged cables, flipped bios on GPU. Sent multiple bug reports through adrenaline software with all data I could find.  I use Firefox and it wouldn't happen so often, but it was still frustrating when it did, so I swapped to Edge. Thought it was just a Firefox problem because it seemed like it wasn't going to timeout, until it did. Tried Chrome, happened on my first attempt. Back to Firefox now and after a recent update, v147, it looks to be stable. It could have been windows updates being helpful, though there was no description of this problem in the change logs. This occurred from driver 25.9.1 to 25.12.1. Haven't tried Chrome and Edge again since I don't use them normally, but I did it at the time to try and find a solution.  I opened a bug report on Firefox: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433)  After all of this, I think it is not a browser specific issue, though at first I thought it was. But I do think that for whatever reason, hardware accelerated programmes displaying media as it is drawn in or interacted with, on a second display, have a chance to cause a driver timeout. What made this clear was when I simply scrolled in Discord one time and it timed out, as it is also hardware accelerated. At this point I still try to reproduce it because it's hard to believe it's fixed, but lately it seems to be better, for now...",AMD,2026-01-21 16:08:10,5

AMD,o0z30iu,"You know what? I've been having the same problem. Not with Chromium apps per-se, as I use Firefox, but I've had a hanging problem happening for the last few months which happens at pure random. Only when playing / scrubbing through video in Firefox or VLC. The hang usually happens very quickly after starting playback. I've also crashed it with Vegas Pro, which also uses the Media Engine.  But I can run video for hours, or game + play video for hours, and have absolutely no timeout. But if I lock and unlock my PC, I might get a hang 1/50 times. Or if I spend a half hour or so scrubbing through video, which is heavily stop and go. Eventually I'll crash it.  There is also a REALLY annoying VRAM memory leak I've been trying to track down. I caught Discord once using over 8GB of VRAM. It's another one of those random and intermittent things which shows up, but doesn't correspond with any GPU usage. Only uptime.  I can't crash the card with only games, or with any stress test though. Even tried OCCT with variable and fixed loads. No crash. No errors. Even tried both of the BIOSs, which were both stable for a good two years, with my card.  EDIT: Hopefully not just speaking too soon, but I remembered that my card has a problem with one of the DisplayPort outputs. If I connect just the right monitor to it, the port drives the monitor just fine, BUT... the GPU will become very unstable for whatever reason. Usually coincides with the HDMI display dropping out randomly. The other two DisplayPort ports work just fine! Might just be a board problem with the 7900XTX I have as I've heard of other reports of this happening on cards with Type C ports, with the Type C port in particular being broken.",AMD,2026-01-22 02:21:52,1

It REALLY depends on the task.   You end up in a situation where there's a trade off between needing to go through the IF more for core to core communication vs needing to go all the way to system memory for memory pulls.   If you have a task where memory bandwidth and latency sensitivities are VERY high and the need for communication between threads is relatively low then the task would work better spread across two CCDs with tons of cache. One hypothetical would be background tasks (windows, etc.) on their own CCD and whatever minor spill over there is from a game also living there.  The ""burden"" that comes with CCD to CCD communication isn't THAT high.      One example that somewhat conveys this - R5 5500 vs R5 3600. The 3600, despite having 2 CCXes (read: requires that hop you mentioned when going past 3 cores worth of workload), the 3600 is generally faster since it has 2x the L3 cache - this is also in spite of the many improvements Zen 3 brings over Zen 2.",AMD,2026-01-25 00:06:12,4

At least your edited image is more realistic when it comes to comparing hardware. You are pitting the 9070XT against the 5090, literally the best GPU of either company.

The dGPU laptop that I have, and have physically seen in stores, are all rather thick and heavy, at least in comparison to most iGPU based laptops.  I guess my question was really more about the packaging logistics.  People tend to buy iGPU based laptops cos they want something thin and light. An iGPU laptop that draws as much power as a dGPU laptop, and requires just as much cooling and weight to go along with that cooling, but still performs below that of a dGPU laptop for games is likely the issue here.  If you want a thicker, hotter, heavier gaming laptop, then you're going to want a dGPU as the tradeoff for that packaging.  The AI Max+ 395 asks for the same tradeoffs, but with gaming performance about on par with a 4060.

Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though.

You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.

The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable?

AMD,nyimhf2,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

AMD,nxv4op7,"Okay, so we've gone right off the rails of a logical discussion. I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

AMD,nzv5tob,"I believe that refined process nodes (the “+++” stages) are what really improve clock speeds, not the first generation of a new node, or at least this is the case for the last 15 years.   Here are some examples:   -Intel’s 32nm Sandy Bridge came after the early 32nm CPUs (dual-core i3/i5 300/500 series and the 6-core 980X), and Sandy Bridge turned out to be an excellent overclocker.   -22nm Ivy Bridge and Haswell were mediocre in that regard, while Haswell-E (a more mature implementation) overclocked better. Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.   Overall, higher clock speeds tend to come from node maturity and refinement, not from the first use of a new manufacturing process, and I believe 5.8ghz could have been possible if intel used its own 10nm process node on ARL considering its HyperThreadingless.",Intel,2026-01-16 04:43:25,1

It's a different game when companies have to worry about that side, far too many consumers make decisions based on their politics when all that does is cause other issues. Obviously I won't go farther than that in a tech focused discussion lol, but I will say again that it's a different game and I don't think anyone wins if it becomes the norm.""  I'm going to add, light heartedly, I do hope we see AMD/nVidia/Qualcomm/etc manufactured and final packaged products coming out of Intel Foundries one day. I'm not sure how or if it will work, but the situation seems dead set not to allow significant further nodes beyond 2 nm or packaging to occur outside of North America.

(This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Intel,2025-11-29 11:19:13,3

But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming.

I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.

AMD,nvbb6wv,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.

AMD,nwenzma,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed. Despite extensive testing, the issue remains unresolved and continues to occur consistently now.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1

When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Intel,2025-11-25 21:43:16,1

AMD,nt12wk5,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

AMD,ntz1is6,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Intel,2025-12-14 13:04:59,1

AMD,nwgvzmr,"u/Intel_Support Thank you for your guidance. My system is a prebuilt, so the processor never came in a box and is likely a tray CPU. Micro Center told me to reach out to Intel for warranty support, so I just want to confirm, should I be working with Intel directly or do you recommend contacting PowerSpec/Micro Center for the RMA? Thank you again, I look forward for the next steps!",Intel,2025-12-29 01:38:35,1

AMD,nxygejg,"u/Sk7Str1p3 I'm pleased to confirm that TME is indeed supported on your i7-12700F processor. TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.  Once you provide your motherboard information, I can guide you on how to check and potentially enable TME in your system's BIOS settings.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",Intel,2026-01-06 05:10:19,1

AMD,nz0ylbi,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Intel,2026-01-11 19:38:08,1
AMD,ny5a7jq,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Intel,2026-01-07 04:53:34,1
