Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",hardware,2025-09-14 15:03:08,21

I'm not saying it's extremely profitable but it can't be too expensive to make since a portion of the volume is likely faulty G21 dies that can't make a B580 or B580.

Intel,ne6f8e1,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",hardware,2025-09-14 15:10:44,31

Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least.

As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power.

It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years.

That is, the A19 Pro on fp has skewed towards the flatter part of the perf / W curve.   >And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W?

Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,5

(there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",hardware,2025-09-18 20:16:47,4

This just means that the massive inefficiencies are not inherint to the CPU uArch, but are a Problem of SoC design.  7W on a single core isnt super efficient, but its far lower than 20-31W. The question is if AMD is able to strip away a large part of those ~20W overhead, but that is not contingent on questions about CPU uArches.  And thats the point of the 1 Core vs 2 Core comparison.

Intel,n1sr0i1,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working.

The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.

I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.

Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.

I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.

I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,12

After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet.

But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs.

Intel,n94duvw,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch.

It's an *extremely* power limited BMG-G21 with only 16 Xe2 cores (B580 has 20) and only a 128 bit memory bus, limiting memory performance to just 224 GB/s: B580 has 456 GB/s.  To get power down to 70 watts and be slot powered, it has utterly castrated the BMG-G21. Only 4 MB L2 cache is enabled (of the 18 MB on the silicon) and it runs 1,000 MHz slower than it does in B580. Some sources claim 8 MB L2 is enabled, so this appears to be a bit unsure at the moment. It's not remotely B580's 18 MB and Intel's dGPU caching architecture is still a train wreck from its IGP origins.  What Intel has done is given it a similar memory config to AMD's 7600XT, 128 bit GDDR6 and 16 GB of it and cut the BMG-G21 down so far it can barely do anything. It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.  It could potentially be useful for AI, since Battlemage has strong INT8 performance, hobbyist level AI is all about CUDA and PyTorch.

All this while running on slot power, so it can go into most servers.  Are there cards that offer better performance?

Engineering and architecture workstations are about rasterisation performance. The designs and drawings have to be rendered quickly and smoothly on your two 4K monitors, which a stripped back and power-throttled 70 watt BMG-G21 isn't going to do.  For very entry level visualisation, we use RX 7600XTs with 16 GB, they have AutoDesk and Bentley certified drivers and enough VRAM and rasterisation to handle it. The RTX 4060 Ti isn't that bad there either, again you need the 16 GB version. On the next refresh of the low end workstations, they're probably going to end up being 9060XT and 5060Tis. Both of those would smash this little thing silly.  To that, I'm not sure who Intel wants to sell this to. $350 isn't serious money and it's competing with gaming-intended GPUs (which are utterly fine for visualisation and design) of much higher performance. It doesn't have substantially more RAM than competing products, it doesn't ECC protect the RAM and workstations generally don't care for slot powered cards either way. The ones we use come as standard with 800 watt PSUs and our choice of ""gaming"" CPUs like Ryzens or Cores, or Threadrippers and Xeons - Xeons are a bit less popular these days.  I'm seeing only an argument here for it being a solid SFF video card. It's the most powerful thing you can run in a 75 watt slot power budget... ~~but it isn't half-height.~~  [Yes it is.](https://www.servethehome.com/intel-arc-pro-b50-review-a-16gb-sff-mini-gpu/) So yeah, a solid SFF card.

Compatibility is pretty decent but it’s hard to tell under gaming since there’s no GPU drivers for anything but embedded ARM graphics.  Under Linux, it’s a totally different story. You have Box64 and FEX-EMU. I switched to all ARM years ago but it came with a learning curve. Compared to three years ago, there’s many high performance games and performance reaches about 50-70% of native x86 performance.  If you wanna see some games running on ARM you can check out some videos I made almost 3 years ago below. I cover native ARM games, ARM games running under Box64, games running under Box64/Wine, and games running under Box64 and Steam Proton.

If a studio has an in-house engine, they'll have to implement it, yes, but it can be done in parallel by the people who work on the engine and not on the game.

Client wanted a 4Tb SSD.I don't want to seem to brag about my skills but I actually build a lot of systems and don't really need internet as I am generally the one giving advice. Aesthetics and RGB was with storage the main criteria here. That's not really how i wanted to spend my client's money but directives are directives and client is happy with it's b580 that will do nothing as it's not intended for gaming and happy with his 4Tb of storage.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",AMD,2024-08-02 03:44:51,1
Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.

If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",AMD,2024-04-02 05:31:11,3

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it.

This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.

At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-5

Intel,k7hhgqi,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",AMD,2023-11-02 09:36:54,0
Intel,k7k4fzn,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",AMD,2023-11-02 20:43:01,0

If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",AMD,2023-10-30 20:36:21,12

Intel,k78mepd,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",AMD,2023-10-31 15:20:46,4

Intel,k77gqlw,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",AMD,2023-10-31 09:18:51,1

Intel,k7kwbcl,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,AMD,2023-11-02 23:41:35,1

Intel,k7aqfmz,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",AMD,2023-10-31 23:27:21,6

Intel,k76zwtm,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,AMD,2023-10-31 05:25:55,2
Intel,k77ddap,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront.

Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking.

It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative.

But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.).

There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better.

It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.  Let's daisy chain 4 4090s ..gets 60 fps.. and then house goes on fire!

Intel,k1sakbd,"At the moment, it’s definitely what it seems like.  Especially seeing how there’s only one card on the planet that can run this. Do you have a 4090?",AMD,2023-09-22 23:39:29,-7
Intel,k1s5318,">I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage.  Not at all, in fact another AAA game with ""path tracing"" is coming out next month.  >The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native  Forget ""native"", that ship has already sailed. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are all working on machine learning techniques, and several game developers are starting to optimize their games around DLSS/FSR.",AMD,2023-09-22 22:59:52,6
Intel,k1t4yk0,"Nope, not even close.  Shaders 3.0 - that's improvement. Ray tracing is noticeable, but nowhere near to justify the hit.  I've looked techpowerup comparison RT vs LOW (lol). Low looked far better and cleaner, then blurry mess of RT (Overdrive).   I don't need ""realistic"" lighting, I need pleasent bisual part with good gameplay. For ghraphics I have a window in my appartment.",AMD,2023-09-23 03:33:41,-3
Intel,k1sakwq,"In a screenshot, sure. When actually playing the game, unless the fps is low enough to remind them, 99,99% of people will forget if they left it on or not.",AMD,2023-09-22 23:39:36,-9
Intel,k1ryjta,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,AMD,2023-09-22 22:15:11,1
Intel,k1stpfv,Man you had to lap your q9300 to hit 3.0ghz? Those chips really weren't OC friendly.  My q6600 hummed along 3.2 no problem on 92mm arctic freezer and a slight voltage bump.  I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.,AMD,2023-09-23 02:01:36,40
Intel,k1w9mwj,Funnily Crysis still have better destructible environments than Cyberpunk has tho,AMD,2023-09-23 19:48:19,1
Intel,k1vonge,"This. People losing their shit either weren't around when Crysis launched or have forgotten just how demanding it was . PT CP kicks the shit out of a 4090, Crysis murdered my 8800ultra.",AMD,2023-09-23 17:36:37,8
Intel,k1txp0j,crysis did not do 1080p 60 on maximum setting and dx10 on a 8800GT.   I had a 1280*1024 monitor back then and barely had 30 fps with my 8800GT.   Even the 8800 Ultra did not do 60 fps on full hd.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=46j6fDkMq9I,AMD,2023-09-23 08:58:05,16
Intel,k1tg0xs,"Man, I remember how hype the 8800gt was. Thing was a hell of a big jump compared to previous cards that came out, prolly our first REALLY powerful card.  Still remember the old xplay video where they build a PC to play crysis and Bioshock. Put 2 8800GTs in sli in there with a core 2 quad which costed one thousand dollars back then!",AMD,2023-09-23 05:23:00,6
Intel,k1syqzz,"My poor HD 4850 got pushed to the limit to give me 1280x1024, lol",AMD,2023-09-23 02:41:04,6
Intel,k1u23r0,I remember thinking $300-400 (IIRC) was so much for a GPU back around those days.  7800XT is the closest we've seen in a while and not even close to the top end for today.,AMD,2023-09-23 09:55:42,3
Intel,k1u67ug,This is still the case to this day because the game includes a really old DLL file for PhysX. The other day I followed the instructions on the PCGamingWiki to delete some DLL files in the game directory and only then it ran perfectly smooth on my RTX 3070.,AMD,2023-09-23 10:47:01,12
Intel,k1t2x0x,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,AMD,2023-09-23 03:15:45,37
Intel,k1ua0tu,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens. Sadly an Nvidia GPU is still required if you want to turn PhysX effects on for games from that era, though I hear that it's possible again to use it with an AMD GPU as primary.",AMD,2023-09-23 11:29:52,9
Intel,k1t6cm4,"OMG I had the exact same experience, hahaha I remember it vividly, I was so confused why that room would just destroy my FPS until I figured out PhysX was enabled LOL",AMD,2023-09-23 03:46:15,16
Intel,k1tlbna,"I'd like to see ray tracing addon cards, seems logical to me.",AMD,2023-09-23 06:23:01,11
Intel,k1tyf7o,"TBH, I could probably run some of the old games I have on CPU without the GPU.",AMD,2023-09-23 09:07:31,3
Intel,k1ub8fu,Had the exact same experience. One scene in the whole game that actually used PhysX,AMD,2023-09-23 11:42:32,3
Intel,k1uhy6a,You could probably run Mirror's edge with physx on today's hardware without gpu fans turning on,AMD,2023-09-23 12:45:10,3
Intel,k1tcex2,Last time I tried on an R7 1700X and RX580 I still couldn't turn on PhysiX without it being a stutter party 2 fps game.,AMD,2023-09-23 04:44:40,5
Intel,k1tsmml,What gpu you have,AMD,2023-09-23 07:51:58,2
Intel,k1tyt5q,Now it even runs fine on a Ryzen 2400G.,AMD,2023-09-23 09:12:37,2
Intel,k1t9hds,"And they were right, PhysX and systems very much like it are still used but things have advanced so much nobody even thinks about it and it no longer requires dedicated silicon.",AMD,2023-09-23 04:15:43,39
Intel,k1vaqdn,"Yeah, it’s been common knowledge for many years now that Nvidia are the most ruthlessly anti-consumer company in PC hardware, and it’s not particularly close.",AMD,2023-09-23 16:09:02,11
Intel,k1tf4z4,Ah good old Ageia before nvidia bought them out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageia,AMD,2023-09-23 05:13:17,3
Intel,k1tt5y9,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",AMD,2023-09-23 07:59:01,17
Intel,k1w7xof,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",AMD,2023-09-23 19:37:48,5
Intel,k1tyzar,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,AMD,2023-09-23 09:14:51,2
Intel,k1v3dv1,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",AMD,2023-09-23 15:22:12,2
Intel,k1uaqi2,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,AMD,2023-09-23 11:37:22,5
Intel,k1uke2m,Intel design will be a little bit different as far as now.  If I understood it right AMD chiplets communicate via lines on pcb but Intel wants to make something like chip-on-a-chip.,AMD,2023-09-23 13:05:30,2
Intel,k1udkaf,bedroom ring library cows summer thought aspiring worm north joke   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,AMD,2023-09-23 12:05:15,3
Intel,k1tl1au,"It's also worth noting that those early movies don't use path tracing either, Pixar switched to PT with Monster University around 2013 IIRC.",AMD,2023-09-23 06:19:42,25
Intel,k1t9pys,"There is a lot of room for improvement, both in the software and future generations of hardware.  It's coming along though!  Overdrive mode looks nice, but there's just a lot more ghosting than the regular RT mode.",AMD,2023-09-23 04:17:58,16
Intel,k1u3wuq,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",AMD,2023-09-23 10:18:38,1
Intel,k1sx1p7,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",AMD,2023-09-23 02:27:32,41
Intel,k1t81d2,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,AMD,2023-09-23 04:01:49,5
Intel,k1szqei,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",AMD,2023-09-23 02:49:05,14
Intel,k1syew7,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,AMD,2023-09-23 02:38:21,9
Intel,k1ug9ty,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,AMD,2023-09-23 12:30:24,17
Intel,k1u52xg,"Yes, better graphics costs performance. SHOCKING",AMD,2023-09-23 10:33:12,13
Intel,k1t1ej8,People do it!,AMD,2023-09-23 03:02:50,8
Intel,k1tqio6,It’s not way slower. I get 110 FPS at 4k with all DLSS settings turned on and honestly it’s insane.,AMD,2023-09-23 07:25:19,10
Intel,k1t7tj4,"I shamefully admit I bought a (inflation adjusted) $400 console in the past to play one game. That's marginally better than buying a GPU for one setting in one game, but still.",AMD,2023-09-23 03:59:48,3
Intel,k1sx4o4,Sounds like most nvidia fanboys,AMD,2023-09-23 02:28:11,13
Intel,k1u2qx4,"If you're into the eye candy, I can see a lot of people that have the money doing it.  Not everyone though. That's around a mortgage payment for me.",AMD,2023-09-23 10:03:52,1
Intel,k1u3no0,And yet people will tell you how nvidia is mandatory. Like you want to overspend to play 1 game with shitty fps? I don't understand these people.,AMD,2023-09-23 10:15:26,-1
Intel,k1y7ifv,Nvidia fanboys being happy with fake frames and fake resolution will never not be funny to me.,AMD,2023-09-24 04:12:33,-3
Intel,k1ss6lq,What? I thought amd was always more tuned to raster as opposed to reflections,AMD,2023-09-23 01:49:57,2
Intel,k1staby,Which is why nvidia is rabidly chasing AI hacks,AMD,2023-09-23 01:58:25,21
Intel,k1sv3ph,This and rumors are saying that the 5090 is gonna be 50-70% faster than 4090 which wont be enough for native 4k either.,AMD,2023-09-23 02:12:20,5
Intel,k1sm72w,Say that to the people playing upscaled games at 4k (540p) on PS5.,AMD,2023-09-23 01:04:07,-2
Intel,k1s6hg3,"I understand some RT effects might not catch everyones eyes, but seriously, path tracing cyberpunk vs 0 RT cyberpunk IS a big difference",AMD,2023-09-22 23:10:00,30
Intel,k1s7ntd,Huh? [Watch this is in 4K on a big screen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_eHxfBsHQ&lc=UgyO2vRiSI6CRU5kYmV4AaABAg.9uyI5P8oamz9uylTN_rdmL) The differences are really apparent in each version.,AMD,2023-09-22 23:18:28,10
Intel,k1slxqu,"PT looks way better in the game to me - it makes everything in the environment have a more natural look to it.  It adds, not ruins it...",AMD,2023-09-23 01:02:10,11
Intel,k1s73qo,"That's how I feel as well. It looks awesome don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look like cyberpunk to me.",AMD,2023-09-22 23:14:27,-16
Intel,k1ttfgf,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,AMD,2023-09-23 08:02:21,11
Intel,k1tby96,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,AMD,2023-09-23 04:39:58,2
Intel,k1sb10i,"I mean, Alan Wake 2 is also releasing with path tracing so my guess is we're definitely gonna see more games featuring heavier RT, although not necessarily path tracing due to the performance hit.",AMD,2023-09-22 23:42:52,12
Intel,k1sf5sr,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",AMD,2023-09-23 00:12:51,2
Intel,k1u66ws,Raytracing now is a gimmick *  ( * - in AMD sponsored games where RT effects are so tiny you have to zoom on to notice them),AMD,2023-09-23 10:46:42,6
Intel,k1t46jg,"Except this is a tech demo. CP77 has lots of cut corners to achieve that, NN was trained to keep the interface stable in that game and even then, ray reconstruction creates horrible artifacts at some angles and distances. And that's with Ngreedia's engineeers literally sitting at CDPR's office.",AMD,2023-09-23 03:26:44,0
Intel,k1u6zio,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,AMD,2023-09-23 10:56:12,8
Intel,k1vnjmf,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,AMD,2023-09-23 17:29:44,0
Intel,k1scklw,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",AMD,2023-09-22 23:53:55,8
Intel,k1s9sl2,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,AMD,2023-09-22 23:33:53,4
Intel,k1s6x1t,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,AMD,2023-09-22 23:13:07,4
Intel,k1s97ev,"Don't forget that all NPCs will be controled by AI to simulate a real life.  They'll wake up in the morning, shower, commute to work, work, then go home.

Intel,k1s8eym,There are horrible artifacts with RR. And ghosting. It replaces artifacts with different ones. Needs a lot more work tbh. Or training.,AMD,2023-09-22 23:23:56,0
Intel,k1wd23h,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",AMD,2023-09-23 20:09:52,1
Intel,k1save0,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",AMD,2023-09-22 23:41:42,6
Intel,k1sama1,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,AMD,2023-09-22 23:39:52,-1
Intel,k1tastr,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped. Remember using artic solver ceramique instead of as5 due to it potentially not degrading as fast as well.   Good times =)",AMD,2023-09-23 04:28:29,19

Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it.

Intel,k1zf2ze,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",AMD,2023-09-24 12:27:53,0

Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT.

Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

Intel,nc8igk2,"Agreed... But the B570 is 150w, and the RTX 5050 is 130w. What about SFF PCs without a PCI-E power connector? What about low power desktops running on battery (RV, etc.)? What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

The prebuilt eGPUs with a 7600 XT are decent. Only 8GB RAM, but the 7600XT easily beats the B50 Pro and 3050 at GB6 with scores of 83093 and 99525. But... it's $550-$600 for these. They aren't upgradable. And that 8GB of RAM is rough.  And sure, the Ryzen AI 395 with the Radeon 8060S is really solid... but Mini PCs with that are at least $1000, and that's getting a whole new machine. Thunderbolt 3+/USB4 ports are now quite common.

Zen 6 is rumored to have a 12 core CCD which will give a single CCD config much better performance while keeping latency down  6) LPDDR6 should give much more bandwidth also and improve performance  Just the first 2 which can easily be done today would put this past a 5060 if not 5060ti, so substantially better than a laptop 4070 and would crush PS5.

AMD,ney2c88,"No, I was speaking about this with respect to Token Generation, not prompt processing. Token Generation scales with memory throughput, which doesn't give CUDA any reasonable advantage in any LLM benchmarks I've seen. People choose Nvidia because consumer cards and older Enterprise cards are just easier to obtain. This also why cards like the P40 and Mi50 still have relevancy today.  I am talking exclusively about consumer based solutions for agentic coding workflows. In those scenarios everything is a mess and these are really the only competition that exists to ageing cards like the 3090 which demand multiple in parallel to use modern coding models, and massively overpriced and overpowered cards like the 5090 which are only purchased because they can barely fit Qwen3 Coder into VRAM.  I really would love to see what you recommend for a coding llm workflow at $2000 and how many tok/s you'd get from it and tell me with a serious face that these aren't the best bang for the buck when it comes to performance/wat, and when it comes to buying new hardware.

Right now some of the best devices you can get in the consumer LLM space are these Strix Halo APUs (that and Apple's M4 chips). Nvidia doesn't have a direct competitor and doesn't attempt to get one because they are very ARM and Enterprise centric. ARM because of their long history with ARM and the technology they leeched off of Mellanox (I have used Bluefield 1/2/3s) and Enterprise because that's where the absurd profits are. Gamers see no value in the massive price inflation that happens past 24 of VRAM, especially when Coding LLMs really need 32/48GB of VRAM these days for best inferencing.  There is exactly 1 consumer GPU from Nvidia that can do 32GB of VRAM and it's the 5090. AMD has Strix Halo. Apple has numerous Apple Silicon products. Yes these iGPUs perform _very_ well with LLM workloads because most LLM workloads are heavily bottlenecked by IO throughput and unified memory delivers that.

The only benefit from strix halo is offering lots of relatively fast ram but performance really lacks behind nvidia and Apples offers.  Why exactly don't Digits Spark or Jetson count?

But Software support can still be an issue in some, especially windows. But that's why nvidia announced x86 versions literally today.   Most LLM devs run hardware like this as servers anyway. There is no point in giving each developer its own training system. And most want to LLMs on Linux but still use Windows for their desktop.   But yes, for people who only want one system, do heavy llm development but don't care that much about performance and don't mind having their desktop system doing the heavy work all the time, can only run Windows but don't mind paying a lot of money, Strix Halo is the only option.

In windows 8 and newer the scheduler keeps threads on the same module if it thinks they have a lot of inter-core traffic.

They could have bought a little time by making a Phenom III by slapping some L3 cache back on there and running 6 cores by default like Thuban.

AMD,nedgds6,"One out of three. Yep interesting and overlooked. I also wondered why I couldn't find L1 cache numbers for RDNA4 anywhere but in hindsight it's obvious.  L1 is per Shader Array (half WGP partition of a Shader Engine) not WGP.  L2 cache redesign is more aimed towards negating the 384 -> 256 bit MC config from 7900 XTX -> 9070 XT. 9070 XT Infinity cache is so fast that the effective BW is actually higher than 7900 XTX's despite -33% lower mem BW.  Oh for sure. The L1 was never a good design. Probably tons of cache thrashing due to small size, it really wasn't that much bigger than LDS, pre RDNA 3 it was actually the same size as one WGP LDS. Crazy to think about a mid level cache shared by 5 WGPs only having the same cache size as one LDS!  >I suspect that AMD would increase the LDS (AMD now calls it ""shared memory"" like Nvidia) to 192kb or 256kb and give it shared L1 cache functionality.  A 256kb L0+LDS addressable mem slab similar to Turing would help AMD a lot. That's already planned in GFX12.5 / CDNA 2 where they plan to allow greater LDS and L0/texture cache allocation flexibility similar to how Volta/Turing does this.  RDNA 5 could go beyond this even, but we'll see, perhaps M3 style L1$ with Registers directly in it. No preallocation of registers and no register for untaken branches = massive über-shaders and no shader precompilation at all just to mention one benefit.

One for L0 cache and LDS and one for instruction caches similar to how NVIDIA Turing and later does it.  But the overhauled scheduling with WGS mentioned by Kepler (see my prev posts in here) does mean that the Shader Engine will need some sort of shared mid level cache for its autonomous scheduling domain.   So I think L1 will make a return but this time one big L1 shared between entire Shader Engine and a proper capacity like let's say 1MB perhaps even more (2MB?). That could explain why the L2 is being shrunk so massively on RDNA5 according to the specs shared by MLID. 24MB L2 for the AT2 die IIRC. That die will have 70 CUs and should perform around a 4090 in raster. That's a far cry from the 9070 XTs 64MB or the 4090's 72MB.,hardware,2025-09-15 16:49:16,1

AMD opting to effectively mid L2 and L3 into one cache in-between like NVIDIA's L2, which is slightly higher latency than AMD's L2, seems like a wise decision.  Will allow them to cut down on area considerable. Look at how Navi 44 at 199mm\^2 is competiting against 181mm\^2 NVIDIA. It's not the SMs that are larger it's the MALL + bigger frontend bloating the AMD design.

With these things said, the LDS is used for matrix multiplication on both AMD and Nvidia designs, and with Blackwell Nvidia also added a dedicated cache for the tensor cores on top of the LDS. Since AMD is currently behind Nvidia they need to catch up, and just relying on their old ways of trying to implement features in compute shaders isn't going to cut it - they _need_ dedicated silicon for both matmul and caches to match Nvidia. But then again they probably won't since it needs to be cost optimized for consoles, I think rdna5 will be a dud on laptop/desktop for this reason unless Nvidia decides to not care about this market segment anymore.

Raster is solved so Sony would rather gimp that by 15-20% and invest heavily in RT and ML than waste all silicon on raster. Nothing is confirmed though but they can't rely on raw perf anymore. PS6 can only differentiate itself on features so that's what they'll push.  RDNA 4 has eq. TFLOPs ML perf compared to NVIDIA. Look at the specs sheet of a 4080 vs 9070XT.

It's actually the FSR3.1 SDK that's implemented in the game that's doing the swap. Also one more correction: ALL FSR 3.1 games use a DLL. The only thing that isn't standard is the use of the AMD provided and signed DLL. But all 85-ish games mentioned in the article here still use the signed FSR3.1 DLLs. The blacklist for FSR4 is empty now: now all titles that have the official, signed FSR3.1 DLL can be upgraded.   The FSR3.1 SDK has a function included that checks to see if the driver has allowed an FSR4 upgrade for a specific title (and setting the option in Adrenaline will toggle this value). If the FSR3.1 SDK sees that value sets, it grabs the FSR4 DLL from the driver files directly, and uses that instead. FYI, this is also why FSR4 can be injected on Linux in exactly the same fashion - Proton supports setting this registry key that indicates whether an FSR4 upgrade is possible or not. Currently, Adrenaline does not let you toggle this value to enable the FSR4 upgrade for titles that use a non-signed version of FSR3.1 - so if a developer makes a couple of small changes or tweaks to the FSR3.1 SDK and/or just decides to compile their own DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade will not be an option in that title (at least, at the moment).  However, members of the Optiscaler Discord have tested that if you replace a game's non-signed FSR3.1 DLL with the signed official DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade toggle does appear in Adrenaline.   > Important note - FSR 4 is not compatible with FSR 3.1 titles that run on the Vulkan® API or use non-standard methods of integration of FSR 3.1 into their games, such as using third-party plug-ins or methods that do not use the signed FSR 3.1 DLL.  > In short, some devs shipped unsigned FSR 3.1 DLLs from older plugin versions and FSR4 won't support that.   > Easy fix that should work - replace the FSR 3.1 DLL with the signed one from FFX SDK 1.1.4/FSR 3.1.4  This is actually something AMD could do in the way Nvidia does with DLSS4 DLL swapping in their driver as an experimental feature.

But even then most of the power draw is due to the SoC and the Infinity Fabric. AMD's chiplet design is inherently bad at minimizing idle power draw, x86 or not. The monolithic R9 395 draws 5W idle with the same 16 Zen 5 cores.",hardware,2025-09-12 19:45:41,2

All the speed bump are related to node advantage and frequency boost there is nothing new under the sun and I doubt it will change anytime soon.  In fact they are stuck on the high-end of things, they can't figure out how to scale their Ultra chips (that is already gluing 2 chips and doesn't scale very well) because they already are at the limits of manufacturing and physics.

AMD,ndphmyd,"What I meant is that Apple does not sell chips for handhelds, desktops or laptops. AMD does not sell handhelds, desktops or laptops. They are not direct competitors.   But even going a level deeper, the number of people who will make a major change to give up on Windows or Linux for a Mac (the only way for AMD to actually even indirectly lose chip sales to Apple) is very small, and many prohibitive barriers are in place before the CPU is a consideration. It very rarely happens, as evident by Apple's stable market share.  Apple has steadily held single digit market share of systems for decades regardless of chips they used, and now that chunk of the market is exclusively served by Apple chips, with no way for AMD to compete regardless of how they perform. Likewise, Apple does not attempt to compete by selling chips for ~90% of desktops, handhelds or laptops that don't run MacOS, so they don't notably threaten AMD's business regardless if they're faster or slower.   In other words, for 9 out of 10 desktop/laptop/handheld buyers, the performance of Apple desktop/laptop/potential handheld chips does not matter as that performance and those chips cannot be in any way utilized in the software environments that people actually use - there is no way you can buy an Apple chip to accelerate those workloads as is.",hardware,2025-09-11 21:27:27,15

I know we are in a hardware forum obsessed with performance of individual components, but even a 30% performance difference isn't going to make a large dent in the users who just don't want to use the Mac ecosystem.

Support has been barebones, but I'll take ARM and RISCV over any X86 architecture, which I still dont understand to this day. Worst still, management is still sticking on X86 but at least diversifying to ARM, and the possibility of RISCV is at least on the table.  Even for gaming, ARM designs are bring considered internally as well, but it takes two hands to clap. Microsoft and the general public have to step in to force these companies into making good products with usable API provided for the respective platforms.  Frankly, I am tired of having subpar products compared to the M4, which runs circles over X86 and open source id a thing now with rosetta emulation. I really dont see why X86 should be the defacto CPU to be used now, and I really truly dislike the narrative ARM/RiSCV should be reserved for low powered devices and such.

The issue is that not all Cinema4D Projects will be identical in performance, there are massive differences between projects (just see more extensive Blender tests, for each project the relative performance differs).   The Benchmark itself is designed to exclude all other aspects like RAM speed and Cache which makes it purely synthetic. The only reason to run renders on the CPU instead of GPU are projects that exceed your GPUs RAM capacity. But then, Cinebench doesn't tell you anything.   And you'll probably say something like: ""But the results are more in line with other benchmarks""   But that's not really true either. It's similar to other 3D rendering benchmarks and do you know why? Because it's similar in Software. They use intels Embree [Embree Github](https://github.com/RenderKit/embree) which is not only used by Cinema4D but many other apps too. It's also used by: Autodesk, Blender, Corona, Redshift and V-Ray.   [https://www.embree.org/](https://www.embree.org/)  It's exaggerated but it's fair to say that Cinebench is basically a synthetic Benchmark of intels Embree.

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz. That's a huge clock speed deficit compared to the 5800XT and 5800X3D. When the 5800X3D first came out, it spanked the 5800X even though it was clocked 200MHz lower all-core (4500MHz vs 4300MHz).  But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron.

Considering intel's current financial difficulties, I'm sure it was considered a waste of resource to design and validate desktop chips that aren't amazing on anything but power efficiency.

Their upcoming E-core Xeon - Clearwater Forest - will also have base tiles for cache and interconnects made on Intel 3.  Seems flexible enough to me.

AMD,nd367aj,"Non existent.  That was a thing about a decade ago.  First of all, Intel can still produce in different nodes.  Intel had the problem that they developed both architectures and process nodes together which both had advantages and disadvantages.  You can’t just switch out the process node for an architecture, every architecture is designed for some nodes specifications. The more you focus on one node the better you can use its advantages which is one of the reasons why Intel was typically superior with their chips. But that also comes with drawbacks like Intels 10nm issues.  Intel didn’t stay with basically Kaby lake for years because they wanted to but because they couldn’t switch to ice lake without the 10nm node. And that’s the reason why Intel fell back on the desktop and servers. If you look at their roadmaps, what became Tiger lake H was supposed to come out as Ice lake in like 2018. But with Rocket Lake they backported Ice lake to 14nm which worked more or less well, depending on who you ask. Since then, Intel developed their Architectures with no specific node in mind which makes them as flexible as any fabless company.   I’d say if anything it’s a huge advantage to have your own fabs today because you can determine how much volume you want for yourself.  TSMC is basically a monopoly at that point which also means that all three, NVIDIA, AMD and Intel compete over capacities and that drives up cost.  And then there is Apple. Apple is like a first class customer of TSMC (for good reasons) and they’re the ones to decide how much they leave for the rest.",hardware,2025-09-08 14:13:42,7

AMD,nd3gez9,"> How big of an advantage is fabless flexibility in practice?  Huge. Not being tied to a fab's success or failure, not being forced to make a direct investment in that yourself, not having to worry about maximizing utilization of that fab, it all adds up. You can see this playing out with Intel real time. They've written down billion of dollars worth of equipment for their newer nodes because of low utilization, and their old nodes are so expensive to manufacture it's a major reason their foundry is so deeply in the red.",hardware,2025-09-08 15:04:40,8
AMD,nd4ke3w,It cuts the other way as well. A independent Intel foundry would have it a lot easier attracting customers.   Right now a customer wouldn't know if it isn't always a second priority to whatever intel deems necessary to their own products.   Also there is the question of exposing your roadmap to a company you are directly competing with on products.  A Intel with both design and foundry is only attractive to those who want monopolistic advantages. If a presumably better node were on intels hands it would only serve them and their products.,hardware,2025-09-08 18:18:35,5

AMD,nddcuof,">How big of an advantage is fabless flexibility in practice?    This is kind of bagging the question. That there is an advantage or even a choice here.   If you don't have 10 billion to invest in fabs you are a fabless. To basically everyone.   There is no flexibility on leading nodes in this industry. You get TSMC one of the few alternatives.   I imagine TSMCs customers pay what TSMC tells them to, only constrained by the reality they can't get too crazy lest they help support Intel when the customers revolt.   This is not a real thing in practice. Design teams are targeting a node whatever it is.   The cost to switch or support multiple nodes is what it is too. You can switch or hedge different options but there are costs.",hardware,2025-09-10 01:25:21,1
AMD,nd2v03f,"I have a couple of follow-up questions since I’m not an expert on nodes:  * When you say **Intel 7 is fully amortized**, what does that really mean in this context? I get that fabs are expensive and equipment gets “paid off” over time, but since these machines are tightly programmed and occupy massive amounts of space, wouldn’t they still represent opportunity cost if they’re just kept alive to meet obligations? * Also, on the point about products being **“tied” to a node** — could you expand on what that practically means? For example, AMD has shown flexibility in the past, like when they re-lithographed Polaris (RX 580 → RX 590 on 12nm). Would that kind of move count as being “not node tied”? * And for Intel specifically, how should we think about this? Are their designs today still bound in ways that limit shifting across nodes, or is the tile-based approach (like with iGPU/cache tiles on Intel 3 vs. cores on 18A) essentially giving them AMD-like flexibility?  Would love to hear more of your perspective on that.",hardware,2025-09-08 13:12:03,4
AMD,ndcpywc,It's a huge risk to have an in-house fab that doesn't get any outside business. 2 points of failure on design and fab side that stop the whole thing.  Intel got stagnant on the design side and then stumbled on the fab side (which causes more churn on the design side) to end up in the huge mess they are in today.,hardware,2025-09-09 23:13:22,4
AMD,nd2vjcv,"So basically with IDM you gain flexibility in design rules and stronger IP security, but you carry all the risk. If you have Intel-level missteps — like missing the mobile wave while PC demand was already declining — the fab overhead turns into billions in write-downs each quarter.  What I find interesting is TSMC’s strategy. They’ve always stuck to the principle of never competing with their customers, unlike Samsung, which builds both its own chips and fabs. That seems to be a big part of why everyone from Apple to AMD has enough trust to let TSMC handle their lithography.  Do you think TSMC’s “pure-play” stance is really the genius move here — the key reason they’ve become the dominant foundry while so many others dropped out?",hardware,2025-09-08 13:15:07,2

AMD,nd327b2,"ADL/RPL were designed specifically for Intel 7. Intel 7 was design with ADL/RPL in mind. The two are closely related. It would require a lot of work to bring ADL/RPL to a different node.   One of the main improvements that ARL/LNL brought was internal design changes that make Intel designs in line with industry standards, using industry standard design tools vs previous designs being custom-made for specific internal nodes. This doesnt matter (directly) to the customer, but it does help Intel's engineering efforts easier going forward.    And while yes there's an opportunity cost to continuing to use Intel 7, a lot of Intel 7's cost structure was paying off the massive NRE costs due to its multi-year delay. These costs were fully depreciated H2 of last year, making Intel 7 much more cost effective.   But besides that, fabs need different types of nodes at different price points. The lithograph equipment used for Intel 7 can't just be reporposed for new nodes which use EUV. Its either use it on Intel 7 (or 16) or let it sit unused. Bartlett Lake exists almost entirely just for this reason.",hardware,2025-09-08 13:52:25,9
AMD,nd343cq,"1. That is basically what it means. As for tooling and machinery, some of them that were intended for the fab expansions that are now either cancelled or have been slowed down, have been repurposed as upgrades for existing manufacturing, so expect those to pay themselves off as well in the future. 2. Since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake, Intel's core IP, at least on the CPU side, is ""99% process node agnostic"", to quote one of the lead engineers who worked on the Lion Cove P-core that goes into Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake. What it means that they don't have to design with a specific process node in mind, and their workflows and design rules reflect that.  3. Basically the choice of node boils down to performance-power-area - which are intrinsic to the nodes themselves, and cost of wafers, time-to-market, and volume availability. The economic aspect as characterized by the latter, can sometimes be more important in determining which product uses which node. For example, Nova Lake, the desktop successor to Arrow Lake, will use both 18A and some advanced TSMC node for the compute tiles.",hardware,2025-09-08 14:02:33,5

Yeah, I’m more of a layman in this space, so I really appreciate the sources you mentioned and I fully understand the NDA limits around these discussions. I’ve always been curious about how much smaller nodes really matter in practice. For example, I use four different 7 nm-class chips across my devices: my desktop (Zen 3) and tablet (Kirin 990 4G) are on TSMC N7, my phone (Kirin 9010) is on SMIC’s 7 nm equivalent, and my laptop runs on Intel 7. I’ve often wondered about the differences between these “same-node” designs, both in terms of marketing vs. actual performance. And looking at newer phones, even the latest 3 nm chips don’t feel like they bring Moore’s Law-level leaps compared to what 5 nm delivered five years ago.

AMD,ndi48ri,"It becomes very specific to the design, any performance changes and the limits of parallelism.   Adding more cores to a single threaded workload will not improve performance.   Adding a larger cache may. Density should help there.   Memories can really benefit from a die shrink because in theory you can have the same design with minor updates just smaller. Then you can have more dies, or arrays of memory cells.   Designs that have multiple dies also have special trade offs in that area. It gets very technical.   Thermal considerations also are really part of this. Many devices are now thermally limited so whatever process reduces heat or helps extract that heat to the cooling design has an impact.   But some designs/workloads are not as effected by this.   And this is not even going into and talking about just improving design because not surprisingly a lot of the performance is made or lost based on the design itself.",hardware,2025-09-10 19:29:54,1

Are scores in line with those from other users with the same processor and GPU, respectively? -  What resolution are you running the games at (1080p, 1440p, 4K)? - what about graphics settings for those games? - Is XMP/EXPO profile enabled in BIOS so the DDR5 actually runs at 6000 MHz? - Is the game installed on an SSD or HDD?

Also, regarding the PSU - PCPartpicker states that your estimated wattage is around 400W, so I think a 750W PSU is sufficient.

But the gist of it is that CS:GO was very cache-optimised and benefitted much more from high clock rates, which were fairly limited on X3D chips before Ryzen 9 due to the thermal limitations of the chip layout.  An i9-12900K for example had 30 MB combined L2/L3 cache. That's like 50x as much as the processors that could run the original CS at 100 FPS. 96MB cache on an X3D chip is obviously superior, but not necessarily a critical advantage for games that use cache efficiently.

Depends on your definition of motion clarity.       If you mean it as just the amount of image persistence based eye tracking motion blur. Then yes, you have a point as they already have 1ms persistence backlight strobbing LCDs. You can even go sub millisecond if you play around with the strobn duty cycle length, Which would already beat a 1000Hz sample and hold monitor in the race for the lowest image persistence)  If you mean motion clarity in a more encompassing way though. Then no. Because the 1000Hz monitor will have shorter stroboscopic steps on relative motions making the motion look more natural for any motion that happens relative to your eyes position.  The ideal ""retina"" refresh rate saturates each pixel described by the motion. Which for fast paced games would already easily justify 10KHz+.

I doubt a pro has a dual PC setup  xDDDDDDDDDDDD  And you tried to teach me about gaming?  You do know 99% of streamers use NVENC to stream right?  **NVENC uses literally 0% of CPU** and maybe 5% of GPU.  Now you fps are going to drop from 1000 to 360 for recording with OBS? xDDDD  Try open your OBS and test how many frames drop lol, in Valorant its literally 0, even at max quality.  >name me the pros that use 8k hz  Literally most sponsored by Razer use 8k.  Ropz for example, Aspas uses 4k , Demon1 also does, qck also uses 8k.  That's 4 but we can go on.  >Also the difference between a mouse polling rate and a cpu is huge, when you go from 1k to 8k hz you only reduce the input latency by 0.75MS.  That's more than the reduction from 600 to 1000fps lol.  >On an ""overkill"" cpu mania as you call it you improve the latency but you also make the games way smoother because of more consistent frame time, pacing and higher 0.1% lows  Oh, the old ''0.1%'' lows argument.

The fans understand that this isn't simply just comedy, it's saying something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, those who dislike Borderlands truly ARE idiots, of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the references to a character being the ""conductor of the poop train"", which is in of itself a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic *Fathers and Sons*.

AMD,newettf,Can you pass this somehow to the Ryzen Master devs?   There has been a bug in Ryzen Master instalation that it will fail when you use specific windows region options instead of US. In my case when set to Bulgarian/BG. I have reported it numerous times and it seems that it is not fixed. I still get thank you coments on my 3 yeard old post about this issue.  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/Z7HLxnjmpQ,AMD,2025-09-18 15:09:05,11
AMD,newxsnp,Massive kudos to the dev team but it could have been communicated better with the Oasis dev.,AMD,2025-09-18 16:39:18,10
AMD,nexqvnq,Yes! Well there is if you have an Nvidia card! An MS dev created a project called Oasis which replaces the Windows MR stuff that MS removed when they decided to kill everyone's expensive hardware! The Dev has had no luck getting help from AMD so while he got Nvidia cards working us AMD users have been stuck. This looks like a sign that AMD has indeed been working on fixing the road block. It still doesn't actually work on AMD but hopefully now the Oasis Dev can get it working.   I posted the new driver over there. It is worth following the sub for news/updates as things progress.

However, performance and stability have been entirely faultless with my 7900XT.  Anyway, regarding driver updates, I've never had any trouble just installing straight over the top of the existing driver via the Adrenalin interface. It used to be that you just download and run the new version directly from Adrenalin, but at some point in the last few months I've got some AMD Install Manager on my PC that does it instead, so YMMV if you have that or not.  I usually _don't_ perform a clean install (I think the tick box is labelled ""Factory Reset"" on the installer window), but there should be an option to preserve settings/config if you do want to do this. I have done it before and it's kept all of my bindings and stuff.  So yeah, tl;dr DDU is definitely unnecessary IMO. Just download the new version and install over.",AMD,2025-09-18 17:29:03,1

It helps people buy the right thing and be happy with what they got...  applies for GPUs too, AMD's GPU stack is not more than 10 thick and for some they can ignore the naming eg OEM / Embedded can get a different name if it needs to get out of the consumer marketing stack.  I think Prizm would be a good brand name to reduce Radeon Pro \[AI\] R\[W\]\[WX\]xxxx naming down to something sane. under then same nomenclature. So AMD Prizm 9926 would be the top workstation GPU next year.  I think the market control groups are partly to blame for this whole issue... because a name is NOT supposed to really convey all the information, its only supposed to clearly identify a card. But they are probably asking people questions like ""how does this GPU make you feel"" or ""do you think this \[insert long forgettable GPU name\] is fast at AI"" type questions ....",AMD,2025-09-13 13:42:58,1

Most people upscale at 4K and 1440P which FSR 4 has very little performance impact. So this benefit of running FSR 4 on RDNA 3 is incredible and the performance is still great. For instance I get 190 FPS running FSR 3 at Cyberpunk 1440P and with FSR 4 now im getting 180 FPS. Not that big of a difference with a massive boost in image quality.,AMD,2025-09-16 14:03:02,22

For 1080p esports gaming, their chips really are among the best at getting such high framerates, especially at their given low power usage.  But if you care about esports gaming you’ll mainly want to pay attention to 1% fps lows. Good news is that the lows also are helped out lots by the cache.

Sell it for less money and still make a profit.  But the rising costs of the latest nodes probably means retaping Aerith is not cost effective. AMD would probably rather use those wafers for higher margin products anyway.  But man: a solid 299 or 349 PC handheld would be great.

Side note, I saw that Corsair has a 385 with 64GB for $1600 and I was a little tempted.  Rumors have been floating about a possible ""big Halo"" and ""little Halo"" if the line is continued. If true, little Halo should be cheaper than current stuff and big Halo could be much faster. This also depends whether we see AMD shipping as small as possibly 2nm product in their consumer division. I trust MLID even less than his net worth, but 2nm could give us a 'small' monolithic APU that's 50% faster than a 370 in both multicore and graphics performance...if you can afford it.

It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Intel,2025-08-19 20:46:34,21

While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification.

Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?
