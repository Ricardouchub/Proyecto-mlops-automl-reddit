High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working.

Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part?

We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.

Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

Based on the TOPS, the inference speed seems to be roughly comparably to a 3060TI for the B60 and the Dual being roughly comparable to a 4080, though i think realistically more like a 3080/4060 due to the bandwiths. I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.

I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.

Intel,mt4vsoz,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,13

EVGA's engineers had the bright idea of making a dual-GPU version of this dual-GPU card, and so they essentially made their own SKU where they linked up two of these cards to form a quad-GPU card. Absolutely insane stuff, and the heat produced from it and the power usage to run it was insane, but in games that supported SLI (which was a bit shoddy) it was an absolutely insane card.",hardware,2025-05-12 16:07:53,12

Can't fault the conclusion though that this card should never have been made with an 8gb option or it should have been priced as a much more direct price competitor with the b580 so customers could choose whether they wanted the better 1080p raster performance or the better 1440p and 4k upscaled performance.",hardware,2025-05-07 11:11:46,149

The bigger deal is that intel has announced some pretty heavy changes and cuts coming and there is good speculation that intel's gpu sector might be cut. If it doesn't happen, it's no big deal, but if it does get cut or restricted, any type of updates or driver updates that are needed for future releases will probably be unlikely to come out.

After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet.

But when I say fairly beefy I basically just mean AM4 5000 series or basically any AM5 CPU even the 7500f, I personally don't know the Intel comparison but I imagine any Core Ultra or 12th gen would absolutely crush it and be fine.  But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs.

Intel,n94duvw,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",buildapc,2025-07-22 14:26:29,7
Intel,n4iwdf8,"Using my 3-fan B580 OC for 1440 gaming and it does a good job. I love its non existent noise level. Back in march I bought it for 330€. Updated driver is released like every 1-3 weeks. I appreciate intel's clean and intuitive driver GUI. I love the way the driver handles crashes, it's exemplary. The driver literally invites to try out some OC. Don't regret my B580. If I'd buy a new card right now, I'd be torn apart between B580 or 9060 XT.   But my main goal was/is a decent gaming experience with a  reasonable power consumption. I don't have a problem to fine tune settings to get stable 60 FPS and a flatline frametime. And it was a decision against NVIDIA, against their dominant position, which they exploit and hurt the market.",buildapc,2025-07-22 13:46:37,4
Intel,n4k7xid,It has bad driver overhead and isn't great for now end systems.  It also doesn't have that great price to performance now that both AMD and Nvidia have released newer gpus.  I would take the 5060 over it at 1080p.  Far less driver overhead for Nvidia.  Dlss 4 is far better than xess,buildapc,2025-07-22 17:28:36,1
Intel,nco631m,"To some degree, yes. But don't expect amazing energy efficiency with the card, its somehow the same performance as the RTX4060, but is 190 watts. Even if the 12GBs of VRAM makes it suitable for 1440p gaming",buildapc,2025-09-06 02:54:35,1
Intel,n4iqq5q,"While I’m sure you want to take advice from someone with that username all day, yes it’s a good card.

Intel,n4is3qg,"Looking at benchmarks, it is really quite underwhelming compared to my old 3070 Ti (which I just sold for $295), which was enough to do 1440p at 144FPS at medium settings. It's definitely not a 1440p card that's going to give you high fps on modern titles. imo a proper 1440p card would be more like a card like a 5070 Ti which can actually do 1440p 144+ fps at highest settings, but 1440p and above with highest settings aren't really budget territory. You'll find that a majority of PC gamers are still playing at 1080p because 1440p isn't offering a great experience on cards lower than a 3070. And I would do the same myself if I had such a low end card.",buildapc,2025-07-22 13:23:48,-3
Intel,nco5tz7,"The 3070ti is a good card, but not that high in performance. Also that card WAS a 1440p capable card, now it can't go any higher than 1080p due to a lack of VRAM, not unless you had that rare 16GB version (which only a few were made)  The B580 can still very much do 1440p 60fps ultra quality, since ultra quality in games is more suited for 1440p compared to maximum settings",buildapc,2025-09-06 02:53:01,1
Intel,n6orlng,"Most tasks in 3D/CG/VFX are predominantly single threaded, until you simulate (not always), render or export something when more multithreaded performance is nice to have available. A 7600 has solid single core performance and in day to day performance will be great.  2x8GB is a mistake though, at least get 2x16GB - preferably 6000cl30 (cl32 and cl36 are fine if the price difference is big). You can save on the cooler for now, use the stock one (comes with a 7600) until she has enough saved for an upgrade.  The Intel Arc A750 is certainly a contentious choice. The only reason I'd go arc at that price point is if she'll be doing a lot of high res video editing, otherwise I'd look at alternatives, possibly second hand. A 3060 12GB would be a nice to have for 3D as NVidia is completely dominant in that space, but you'd probably need some second hand luck; I find them for around 200 EUR in the Netherlands. It'll perform a bit better than the A750 in gaming too, and has way better software support.  You can always save on the case and may be able to shave off a bit going for an mATX board, though less than 140 EUR for a wifi one is unlikely.",buildapc,2025-08-03 12:58:30,4
Intel,n6osl9e,"All parts look good but something to consider is some software just runs better on nvidia than others. I know this is true with video editing so maybe look at any applications she’ll need to run and see how the performance is before going with the intel card.

Its the poor driver software stack.  The hardware has serious potential!  A770 is maxed.  I see this B580 ownership  as I leased the card for the summer +$60.      Can you buy from the [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) USA website for our cost?? Shop our stores in the USA.   I should remind you the Steam cold crashes suck.  I have an Asus 850w Platinum for it and I know there's no power fail issue sooo its a goner.  Im old enough to say ive seen this before.  Dont hang out until its done right so long after its release.  Not a hot buy now imo.  There's the AsRock Challenger or the Sapphire Pule within $10 of each other. $359-369.

Also, you can probably just clock up your RAM manually with some trial and error (e.g. I got a 3000/15 kit and clocked it to 3600/16).  As for the GPU: An RX 9070 should be around 30% faster than a 3080 on average. For Cyberpunk specifically, the RX 9070 should even be close to 50% faster. And you'd save some money due to lower consumption on top of that (usually \~2-3ct/h gaming, which won't make a big difference at that cost, but it is something to keep in mind).",pcmasterrace,2025-08-30 12:36:16,3

You can always free up your Windows install and remove bloat. Minimum for Win 11 is like 2-4 GB base RAM usage, so you should have enough left for gaming. Really only becomes an issue when you do stuff like open Chrome with dozens of active tabs and have like 12GB base RAM usage before even opening the game.  140€ is just a horrible price for outdated RAM.

Well, 5800X3D is around 7600X performance in most games. Maybe slightly better whenever the 3D-cache matters. Usually, you get \~10% per gen, but just the one gen step to the 7800X3D is already 20% faster.  There certainly is no big reason to upgrade right now, but it also makes no sense to get new DDR4 RAM. Realistically, you could just sell RAM+MoBo+CPU and get like 300-400€ for it. Which you can then use to get an AM5 system with a 9600X or so. You might even be able to get a 7800X3D system if we include those 140€ that you would be willing to spend on new RAM.

Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20
Intel,m84uer1,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.

(I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services.

Because it absolutely does work as intended with Arc. Arc's VRR is based on VESA's adaptive sync, like Freesync and G-sync compatible also are.  As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

Intel,lenkqpy,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,69

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.

So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

Intel,kxiah6c,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face.

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6

It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise.

If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",AMD,2023-10-30 20:36:21,14

Intel,k774q01,That's with 5700 and 1070.... WHAT exactly are you expecting those cards to do in visually demanding AAA titles in 2023?  People have some crazy expectations. Everyone wants the eye candy but no one wants to pay the performance cost.,AMD,2023-10-31 06:26:48,3

Intel,k74k70d,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",AMD,2023-10-30 19:05:17,3
Intel,k7a00mh,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore.

Intel,k75quo4,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies.

Intel,k75m1nd,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares.

Intel,k7795r7,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,AMD,2023-10-31 07:28:35,4

We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it.

I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets.

Intel,k77gx0m,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative.

But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.).

There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better.

Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.

Intel,k1s3cm8,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,AMD,2023-09-22 22:47:37,-14

So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,AMD,2023-09-22 22:15:11,1

It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

Intel,k1t81d2,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,AMD,2023-09-23 04:01:49,4
Intel,k1szqei,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good.

Intel,k1ttfgf,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened.

Intel,k1tby96,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.

Intel,k1sf5sr,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",AMD,2023-09-23 00:12:51,2

They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",AMD,2023-09-24 12:27:53,0

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff.

Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Intel,jwuapdo,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense.

Intel,jx3nm3i,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",AMD,2023-08-21 06:56:43,1
Intel,jwv7qel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:05:22,2

Intel,jwuwjmm,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",AMD,2023-08-19 13:47:45,1

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1

Intel,nc8igk2,"Agreed... But the B570 is 150w, and the RTX 5050 is 130w. What about SFF PCs without a PCI-E power connector? What about low power desktops running on battery (RV, etc.)? What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits. [Geekbench 6 Benchmarks from Toms Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-arc-pro-b50-is-up-to-20-percent-slower-than-the-arc-b570-gaming-gpu-in-early-geekbench-tests-almost-doubles-the-a50-in-synthetic-tests) show 69890 OpenCL and 78661 Vulkan, which is slightly better than the 3050's 63488 and 62415 respectively.  The prebuilt eGPUs with a 7600 XT are decent. Only 8GB RAM, but the 7600XT easily beats the B50 Pro and 3050 at GB6 with scores of 83093 and 99525. But... it's $550-$600 for these. They aren't upgradable. And that 8GB of RAM is rough.  And sure, the Ryzen AI 395 with the Radeon 8060S is really solid... but Mini PCs with that are at least $1000, and that's getting a whole new machine. Thunderbolt 3+/USB4 ports are now quite common.

No one will defend AMD products before Zen 1.   I will definitely use a newer better AMD chip today but back then he'll no. There GPU line has driver issues and its why all of us just use NVIDIA gpus. There is a good reason.    Intel's new chip design strategy and leading edge fab is solid. The problem is foundry capital expenditure and foundry capacity. They have to build excess and train excess personal. The Ohio Silicon Heart Land. A whole new campus, town, new families, and Silicon ecosystem.    That takes time and a ton of money. And investment (aka the money levers) just dont want to pay for this. They rather get there money's worth of AI and self driving vehicles today. They know Chinese EV investment is bad and Chinese AI is bad. So rather than invest in Chinese companies and not make money, they want to use there leverage to pump up American companies.    This way American companies like Tesla and AI will succeed and win this AI race.   In other words, China ain't in the leading edge foundry game. None at all. No chance. So why pump money into that? They instead are attacking the EV and AI race. So our American companies will need capital to defend that space.   Intel design products are absolutely solid. 1000% they maintain better MT performance without SMT. SMT has security vulnerability.    Intel products are wafer Silicon efficient with p and E cores. Intel design is solid. Just foundry is extremely expensive and there isnt a China competitor. Taiwan is a very safe island.   If Taiwan was like a Hawaii, easily conquered, then for sure TSMC is at risk. But Taiwan today is like an island carrier/fortress. Too difficult to go against.

AMD,nbh6cyf,"Charts are missing the 5800XT which is currently around the same price as this ($205 USD). Would've been nice to include it to see if the 8-core non-X3D part is a better value. The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz. That's a huge clock speed deficit compared to the 5800XT and 5800X3D. When the 5800X3D first came out, it spanked the 5800X even though it was clocked 200MHz lower all-core (4500MHz vs 4300MHz).  But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron. For those on a budget, the 5800XT looks even more attractive because it has gone on sale for $125-150 and comes with a decent cooler.",hardware,2025-08-30 11:49:49,9

Considering intel's current financial difficulties, I'm sure it was considered a waste of resource to design and validate desktop chips that aren't amazing on anything but power efficiency.

AMD,nc00dol,"The 5070 Super is rumoured to have 6% more cores, as well as 18GB GDDR7 and possibly a small clock speed bump. It should be reasonably powerful, probably matching the 9070 in raster. If that is the case, the 5070 Super could be a no-brained.  But I would guess that AMD will refresh the 9070 if Nvidia refreshes the 5070. It won't get a VRAM bump, but I could see them bumping the power limit up to the same wattage/CU as the 9070XT, which would be 266W. The 9070 is currently so power limited that simply pushing more power is a completely viable option for a refresh.  266W would enable AMD to bump the clock speeds by 300-400 Mhz, which would keep the 9070 firmly in contention with the 5070 Super, while costing AMD and their board partners nothing, since 9070s usually have 9070 XT coolers specced for 304W or higher, I think the Sapphire pulse 9070 is the only exception.  AMD would simply have to push a new BIOS and/or unlock the power limiter in Adrenalin. They could potentially even push an update in Adrenalin that swaps the vBIOS.  I'd probably still pick the 5070 Super over the 266W 9070, but it still wouldn't be a complete no-brainer, since the 5070 Super would probably be worse in raster, but better in RT. If AMD Redstone launches before the 5070 Super and gives a nice bump in ray traced (and especially path traced) titles, I think the 9070 could remain competitive.",hardware,2025-09-02 12:02:07,7

What most of the ""HUB IS WRONG"" crowd don't get: Steam Surveys actually show perfectly well how tiny the DIY segment is.  It simply doesn't matter at all how DIY does, prebuilts will outsell DIY by two orders of magnitude. Shocking that HUB don't have insight sources inside Dell, HP and Lenovo.

At that point it’s a useless test.  It’s not like it’s impossible to test at multiple settings, but 1) reviewers have a limited amount of time to test cards, and the time they have is only getting shorter with each review cycle, 2) medium settings aren’t standardised. Leaving out naming oddities like GTA V’s high being the medium setting, what each game decides to reduce when lowering settings down to the medium preset isn’t standard, one game might disable grass textures entirely while another will barely reduce them, and so on. If you want all games tested to be on a level playing field, it makes sense to crank all the settings to max. And 3) the whole point of a test is to push the GPUs to the max. If you drop the settings down to medium, with the high end modern cards you’re going to be limited by the CPU. If you do all your comparisons at 1080p low, then you’ll conclude that a 5080 has about the same performance as a 5090, even if that is definitely not the case.",hardware,2025-09-03 09:05:48,-1

Some on reddit, some on other forums.  Sometimes I'd come across a thread of someone who was like ""I got it stable at 4.4 GHz with 1.41v"" etc etc, key being > 1.4v. Other places people would basically just be like ""oh nice grats"" etc. Whenever I'd find those no reddit there'd be a bunch of comments calling OP crazy, telling them the processor wouldn't last more than a few weeks etc etc. One particular comment I still remember was ""You better already have another one coming to you in the mail, because that'll be dead by this time next week.""   Well my i7-6850K that ran at 4.3GHz @ 1.425v for the past 10 years says otherwise...  Or another great is in that build I had a secondary GPU, because I run more than 4 monitors, and single GPU can only output to 4. Like oh my god the amount of people being like ""you don't need 2 gpus!"" and I'ld have to be like ""yes, to run 5 you do..."" and they'd just be like ""then only use 4"" and like ""ok but I need 5, so using less than 5 isn't an option..."" - Or you'd have them coming in be like ""You're just hurting the performance of your main GPU because it'll be running at x8 instead of x16"" and me having to explain ""No, i7-6850K has enough lanes so the bifurcation on the X99 Classified keeps both at x16..."" one even argued with me to the point I linked to the user manual stating if slot 1 and slot 4 it is x16/x16 on 40 Lane processors, and they still trying to say I was wrong up until I posted a photo of my BIOS screen showing x16/x16.",hardware,2025-09-02 07:12:21,5

AMD,nc47tse,"Here's why Intel will never make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and why their situation is different to AMD/Radeon's.  1. Intel is basically an upstart in GPU, they have zero brand presence or mindshare to build off of. AMD on the other hand has Radeon which has been around for 20+ years. In fact the only thing gamers know about Intel's GPUs is their crappy Intel HD 3000 iGPUs that couldn't run games at playable frame rates. AMD doesn't have this issue.  2. Intel is slow to compete with NVIDIA. Look at Battlemage and how we're STILL waiting on the B770, it might not even release. People are not willing to wait for your product to release, if they want to upgrade, they will upgrade to what is available. AMD also doesn't have this issue, within a month or two, AMD was competing with Blackwell.  3. Intel had only bad press with ARC's initial launch, especially because of the drivers situation. Whilst Intel has tried to improve the drivers significantly and done a great job marketing Battlemage and the product even being solid, first impressions are hard to shake and had Alchemist had a better launch, Battlemage would have sold better. AMD doesn't really have this issue, they have for one or two gens but that was long ago and not anywhere close to the disastrous driver situation Intel's had. AMD drivers for the most part, might have a small issue in a few games on release, but they actually worked and were able to play games. Some games on Alchemist wouldn't even launch or run correctly.  4. Battlemage and Alchmeist doesn't compete across the stack. For what it's worth, only competing with basically the 4060 made Battlemage a sort of pointless generation because if you bought say an RTX 3060 years ago, it's not really an upgrade to buy a B580 or B570. Furthermore, if you have a 3070 or anything else, you literally cannot upgrade to a Battlemage card because it's a downgrade in performance. Competing across the whole stack is essential to getting sales and to convince people that your product is fast. This is probably the closest problem AMD has to Intel, but with RDNA3 they tried to compete across the whole stack, they just got destroyed.",hardware,2025-09-03 01:21:43,5

Who the hell is buying a prebuilt to run an LLM locally? Almost no one.  Anyone serious about running an LLM is probably renting a server, running a cloud instance or is renting a datacenter. Anyone wanting to try an LLM is probably going to try ChatGPT, or Grok, or DeepSeek out online to ask stupid questions. Or they will go to someone like Lamba or Vast or Linode etc and setup a cloud instance. I would say maybe 0-1% of all people interested in LLMs are going out and buying a prebuilt with an NVIDIA GPU to run one. If you can show me some hard data for this I'd be honestly surprised and happily retract what I said. But it's just not cost effective or smart to go out and buy a prebuilt to run an LLM.  >  People think gamers are obsessed with buying Nvidia, try the boomers who are integrating LLMs into their firms who now see AI = Nvidia and won't buy anything else.  Boomers who are integrating AI into their businesses are most certainly going to some other contractor who does it for them and those contractors likely run cloud instances, not local prebuilts in their clients' offices. Any big customer like a multi-national corpo is also likely looking at cloud or datacenter AI too.  Also Steam HW survey is showing NVIDIA 50 series is buying bought up and absorbed into gaming rigs.

Also, AMD constantly fails to make a good dGPU offering in laptop. The RX 7600S was basically in nothing that people could buy because AMD never supplied enough.

Not to mention, Intel was planned Government subsidies that they didn't receive in time that has affected this whole grand plan of Pat's.  It's not as simple as ""hurr durr, Intel has low prices and low margins and now they're broke"". Even then, Arrow Lake isn't exactly going for a fire sale either in terms of global pricing, in most regions it's hovering at MSRP, it's just that no one has a reason to ""upgrade"" to it because it's trash.  > You are forgetting that Nvidia have a R&D budget far larger than anything AMD or Intel can afford to spend on developing GPUs right now.  You AMD fans always say this inane excuse, yet somehow you also say AMD has slain the Intel giant with 1/20th the R&D. R&D money is great and all but only if you use it wisely as AMD has in CPU and they could replicate that same success in GPU, but they ignore GPU division pretty much entirely.  > If AMD cut RDNA4 prices to bare minimum, how would they afford the even larger budgets for future architectures like UDNA2, UDNA3, etc?  Well AMD is in a unique position because they have more than one product segment to fall back on. NVIDIA lives or dies by GPU, if the GPU they produce is utter garbage and GPUs fall out of favor in the wider market, their entire product portfolio is at risk and their future. AMD on the other hand has CPU to fall back on, consoles and handhelds. Considering how well AMD's CPU division is going right now, they can easily take away some (not all), but some resources from CPU and funnel it into GPU to improve it.

[High availability on that specific day?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPE95_RnL_Q)  > We dont have specific numbers to argue which vendor had more nominal product available on day 1. We only know the total, final sales over the whole quarter, and we know that the 9070XT launched with only 3 weeks left in the quarter.  But you said there was high availability of RDNA4 on launch day. So what is it, high availability on launch day thanks to a delay or only 3 weeks left in the quarter and so the Q1 figures are wrong because AMD didn't have enough time to sell through? In either case both RDNA4 and Blackwell sold out on Day 1. So... it means AMD didn't sell a lot really if their Q1 numbers were so low.  > There is no doubt that BW sold more in Q1 than RDNA4 - not only because of launching earlier in the quarter but also because they produced more volume. But 9070XT had high available inventory on launch day. This isnt disputed. Plenty of people (foolishly) factored that in with their forward projections.  See the video I linked above, it was all a fugazzi. I wouldn't call 705 cards on launch day at a large retailer in one city like Dallas which has a population of 1.3 million ""high availability on launch day"". Within 10 minutes they all sold.  Granted this is one location of one retailer in one region it doesn't illustrate the picture everywhere, but considering that in the video it's discussed that most of the volume went to NA rather than other regions like Europe.

I mean we can just see from Steam HW survey and JPR numbers that NVIDIA shipped way more stock in both Q1 and Q2 than RDNA4.

AMD simply made out like the MSRP was $599 by giving AIBs grants/kickbacks/allowances (whatever you want to call it) for selling a cheaper model at that MSRP on launch day for a limited run of units.  Regardless, this is all one big distraction. I still need you to answer the above question. Please answer it.  > Your own source claims Microcenter had 11,600 RDNA4 cards on launch day and 500 Blackwell cards on launch day.  Again, one retailer in one region. In other regions like China there were floods of Blackwell on launch day, entire warehouses stacked. By contrast AMD had little stock in Europe for RDNA4.  > And according to your own video, that's more cards at one retailer than Microcenter had 5090s and 5080s combined at every one of their stores combined.  Yes because NVIDIA focused on Asia and AMD focused on NA. But please answer the questions above. Thanks.",hardware,2025-09-04 13:34:36,4

A ""\~25% fabric traffic reduction"" in gaming tests isn't a free +25% to external bandwidth, and it doesn't erase a \~40% raw GB/s gap. Even if we assume AMD just matched or let's even go as far as to say \~10% better than Nvidia's compression, they'd still be well behind on effective bandwidth.  The simpler explanation for those results is that the tested scenarios aren't that bandwidth-bound.

AMD,naxro34,"Kepler\_L2 said L0 and L1 is merged in CDNA4. Maybe RDNA 5 goes even further and merges all CU level caches (including VRF) into one big shared flexible cache like Apple did with M3 and A17 Pro.   Like you said it's about SRAM scaling being bad and minimizing SRAM investment. N3P = no scaling, N5 poor scaling vs N7.      NVIDIA definitely has the advantage here while AMD's cache system is overly complicated and inflexible. The next logical step is to make caches into one big shared block that can be dynamically allocated for different purposes.   L1 will be much more important with the new WGS and ADC scheduling and dispatch within each SE. No more global scheduling only work item preparation and load balancing. This and other methods could explain why L2 will be less important and less used allowing AMD to use 24MB L2 on AT2 (According to MLID and Kepler\_L2 rumours).   Actually the rumour for AT2 is +25% CUs and -25% PHY width vs 9070XT, so perhaps AMD has some novel and forward looking memory saving technology in UDNA. AT2 on paper could easily be stronger than 4090 in raster and that's wild with 24MB L2 and such a weak memory subsystem.

AMD,nb9ocih,"The new patents changes things quite significantly especially the scheduling changes that align with GPU workgraphs, but that's reserved for games many years into the future (fine wine). Apparently also major cache level changes in RDNA5 so that's another source of potential RT gains.  Conclusion on Spring post was a conservative on par with NVIDIA Blackwell, new patents suggest significantly ahead. Yes indeed and I mentioned that at the bottom of my comment. They can't allow AMD to take the PT crown. Also maybe something insane nextgen like a NeRF ASIC within the geometry pipeline. IIRC NVIDIA had a paper on this a while ago.     That's true but the interesting thing is that if you go even further back IIRC I couldn't find an RT patent that didn't get implemented in RDNA4. So at least for RT patents most of them can reasonably be expected to be implemented in RDNA5. Skeptical about the DMM patents, but everything related to DGF and prefiltering nodes is pretty much a given.  Perhaps this time it's different, we'll see but not fully convinced either.

The fundamental core is still Ampere which at is core is still Turing/Volta so a clean slate might happen and that could have massive ramifications similar to AMD's RDNA5/UDNA.  On AMD side let's just hope the architectural changes are massive + AMD's patent derived (unconfirmed) scheduling overhaul is forward looking like GCN Async compute.

AMD,nbvnuh2,"There's another patent supporting RDNA5 potentially being amazing if you're interested. Already mentioned it in the post 4 weeks ago, but I understated the impact. Local launchers are very likely to be arriving in each RDNA5 WGP. This will allow them to launch and schedule work and manage ressources on a per WGP basis with a 10x dispatch latency reduction vs the command processor within each shader engine (rn I think).   For workgraphs workloads this will result in insanely high speedups. Ray tracing and procedural code will see massive speedups. Unfortunately think this requires developers to change code like the Workgraphs API. But perhaps AMD can do some magic at the compiler level, but I doubt this. We'll see.  NVIDIA better have something major nextgen or AMD will leap frog them. Repeating myself here but Kepler already called RDNA5 the biggest change since GCN.

Also for casual users that thing might prove counter intuative - imagine turning FSR4 in option expecting FPS increase, but in reality you actually lose performance or have just a small bump.

Can RDNA3 see efficiency gains in this way, or is FSR4 computationally expensive enough in some way on the older architecture that it largely negates the drop in render resolution?

AMD,nbz1dwn,">You're losing 20% fps to get better image quality vs FSR3.  As I explained in the post, it's not a flat 20%. As framerate increases, the gap between the two increases. If we were talking about a 20% performance difference at like 50fps native, so after upscaling it would be the difference between 60fps and ~75fps sure. But it wouldn't be. If after FSR4 you were averaging 60fps (16.67ms per frame), then with FSR3 you'd be looking at around 66fps (15ms per frame) on average.  The reason why that matters is I'd be a lot more concerned about the performance difference if I were struggling to break 60fps with FSR4. Reality is, the difference in upscaling quality vastly surpasses the difference in performance when both techniques surpass >100fps. Also, with FSR3 I would never tolerate below quality preset at 1440p, because artifacting becomes extremely noticable. Even at the quality preset FSR3 is a clear downgrade from native at 1440p, it's just in the realm of being an ""acceptable compromise"" for me.  For FSR4, honestly even performance preset can resolve things better in some instances than FSR3 quality, even if it's probably not altogether better in terms of image detail. I showed off the ultra quality preset to prove that FSR4 does reasonably well in terms of performance, if I showed off the balanced preset in this scene, performance would be similar to XeSS for better quality still. It would end up looking best no matter how you slice it.  >You're gaining 10% FPS for probably slightly worse image quality vs native with TSR.   Yeah, no. FSR4 at ultra quality preset is hugely overkill for trying to achieve native TSR-like image quality. That bar of ""slightly worse than native"" is where I'd put FSR4 balanced preset at 1440p, not the ultra quality preset. The latter resolves detail much better than native TSR.",hardware,2025-09-02 06:51:49,17

And lastly, FSR3 upscaling is strictly worse than FSR2.1 upscaling - AMD made pretty significant steps in the wrong direction with regards to image stability.   You know what those frametimes at the end remind me of though? DLSS3 framegen frametimes, where even a 4090 needed to take >3.5ms to run DLSS3 framegen, making the technique that was only useful at higher framerates almost useless when you had high framerates to start off with! And what's worse, FSR FG and XeSS FG are so much better that they visually achieve the same thing with half the  frametime cost!

A lot of slower RTX cards spend that much time doing upscaling (from say 1080p -> 4k) with DLSS3 and especially 4. 2.3ms is even fast enough to be useful at high frame rates- i.e, if you have a 8ms render time at 4k native (over 120fps), a 2ms render time at 1080p, then adding a 2.3ms upscale step back to 4k still gives you 232 fps. In practice, your probably going to have other things bottle-necking you more than the 2.3ms upscale time.   Of course, it's even more useful at low FPS. I.e, if you're rendering CP2077 at 4k with RT on at 20fps, turning on upscaling (just with the simple ""1/4th time to render the frame + upscaling time"" naive equation) would give you 67FPS. We pretty much already see that in action with cards like the 4090 getting 15-20fps at native 4k with PT, but hitting 60fps with DLSS performance mode on. At those points, upscaling is less so ""a nice feature"" and more of a hard requirement (and this isn't due to bad optimization- PT is just extremely compute intensive and we need things like upscaling to make it run reasonably).",hardware,2025-09-02 05:05:42,4

AMD's strategy of using raw compute power on the general shaders for things like AI and RT has its own tradeoffs (area & complexity vs performance) but it quickly boxed them in with things like RDNA3's FSR situation. Nvidia gave themselves a path forward that had much more room to grow, and as a bonus has a longer catalog of hardware that can stay backwards compatible.  AMD just now created that path forward for themselves in RDNA4, so hopefully they stick to it through UDNA so FSR5+ can be usable for these cards as they age. The 9070XT and even 9060XT are going to be plenty of GPU for a lot of people for a long while, so they should get continued support.

It feels like I've been talking about RISC-V for a long time, because I actually have. Got my first board in 2019 (kendrite k210, a MCU that's based on pre-ratification specs from 2016, OK for user code but not so much supervisor mode / running Linux and such), and also got VisionFive2, the first large-scale SBC, in early 2022. That uses U74 cpu from SiFive, based on the ratified 2019 spec, again 3 years.  I have been consistent, and it has happened consistently: 3 years from core announcement to hardware. Note many IP vendors develop while tracking specs closely, and typically announce their designs shortly after the specs are ratified.  RVA22+V hardware arrived 2024, right on schedule. And RVA23 hardware will be out in 2026, without a doubt, as microarchitecture announcements also happened shortly after spec ratification. And this timeline seems to be on track. A few months ago Tenstorrent presented at a RISC-V conference, and mentioned they were about to tape out the Ascalon design. Ventana commented similarly about Veyron V2 production at scale.  RVA23 has consistently been the target for both Google and Microsoft, thus I will not be surprised when mass market products (such as netbooks or android phones) show up in 2026.  >Risc-V still has a long ways to catch up  The ISA caught up in RVA23. It's not just better than x86-64 (a low bar), but is also no worse than ARMv9, actually doing better in the metrics that matter for an ISA, such as code density or having shorter chains of interdependent instructions (long such chains block superscalar execution).

Then there's the performance issues, granted most of these are due to the way below average linux support, but they are still valid, especially since RV boards are less likely than arm boards to get vendor support and kernel updates (visionfive2 i believe is on the 4 year old end of life 5.15 kernel). Worth noting that most of the benchmarks that make RV boards shine only result in real world performance an entire chip tier below old arm designs.          Then there's the lack of consumer hardware using RV (2 laptop models, probably less than 1000 sold, compared to hundreds of arm models and millions sold.     Then there's the relative lack of users compared to arm.     Then there's a lack of margins compared to arm (for example the main benefit of RV is cost, but the boards aren't cheaper).    Then there's the lack of scale compared to arm.     Admittedly there are some real wins for RV right now, in bringing down costs for manufacturers for routers and IOT devices (this should be bringing them better margins even if they are not being passed down to consumers, but eventually that might change).    I can't possible see ""It'll never take off, now that RISC-V exists. In 1-2 years we will even forget these ARM laptops were a thing."" this statement being true in that time frame.

AMD,nch3t1q,"> Specifically I've been reading about feedback from users; the issues resulting from bad linux support for basic hardware (like ports) seems comparable to arm about 10 years ago.  First mass-produced SBC. Its purpose was precisely to bootstrap all of this, and it did its job.  Debian's RISC-V port is built by a mix of VisionFive 2 and older SiFive development boards using an older version of the same core (U74). It is the third architecture with the most packages built (over 98.5%), close to aarch64 and amd64 (x86-64), and above powerpc.  Driver-wise, most is already upstream in the Linux kernel, only the GPU is missing, and that's solely imatech's (of powervr's fame) fault.  Mine currently functions as my home server, with ZFS root on m2 ssd and another pool on external UASP enclosures. It runs Debian Trixie, with its mainline kernel (a generic kernel not specific to the board). Before this, I used it as a second desktop.  >Then there's the performance issues  U74 is an in-order microarchitecture, a design comparable (but actually smaller and more power-efficient despite faster) to Cortex-A53.  It lacks Vector extension and only has partial bit manipulation, which hampers many user cases, but this shouldn't be surprising. I got my VisionFive 2 in feb 2022, that's about 3 months after RVA22 (which includes bitmanip) and Vector got ratified. It couldn't possibly have any of that. Hardware with these arrived 2024, as per the three year rule.  >I can't possible see ""It'll never take off, now that RISC-V exists. In 1-2 years we will even forget these ARM laptops were a thing."" this statement being true in that time frame.  You can't see it now, because you seem familiar with released products (e.g. VisionFive2, early 2022), yet not the events leading to them. Base RISC-V specs ratification in 2019, and SiFive's U74 announcement. Add three years and you got VisionFive2, based on U74.  2026 is finally the turn for the large microarchitectures announced in 2023. Not tiny in-order cores, but large out-of-order, with SPECint2006 ranging Zen to above Zen5 performance.  >In 5 years RV may or may not be competitive for average consumers, but it almost definitely won't be surpassing arm in regards to units sold or profit margins.

Efficiency is not just a factor of the cortex model, a53 is made on many different nodes, with many different instruction combinations and designed with different power envelopes in mind; there is no one cortex-a53. If it really is more efficient then an a53, then It's kind of surprising we haven't seen it in a single ereader model so far.

AMD,nab1e1g,"If we all want vanilla, the same flavor, the same performance, then forcing board makers to adhere to AMD's recommendations is fine.  Many enthusiasts are building pcs to tinker with them, to make adjustments to make them a little better a little different.  This is why we have options in bios to make changes.The ""p"" in pc stands for personal, we want to make it ours.  Manufacturers understand this and create products to sell into the enthusiast market to meet this need.  The manufacturers need to be mindful of the risks they take and not go to the extreme of torching cpus and mobos (a la Intel).  The manufacturers are trying to balance performance vs longevity.  In general they do a good job.  The problems with Asrock boards effected a small percentage of boards.  A significant number of boards were impacted to be sure, but still a small percentage.  The estimates I've seen are perhaps 1 to 2%.  Had it been as widespread as some think, 50%+, Asrock would have had to pull their boards immediately because that high a failure rate is unsustainable financially AND it will destroy the brand's credibility.    It is helpful to keep perspective on the magnitude of the problem and why the manufacturers are enticed to take risks.  The board makers are appealing to builders who are looking for competitive advantages.  Sometimes, the engineers fly a little too close to the sun.  This is similar to the problem Nvidia has with the 12vhpwr connectors.   There is no doubt there is a problem, yet the vast majority of 5090 cards run fine with no melting cables.  Most people with Asrock or other boards suffered no failures.  If you were someone whose board/cpu failed, it was a major problem and unacceptable.  I get that.  It is important to keep perspective.  I encourage the designers, engineers, manufacturers to push the envelope to wrest better and better performance from their designs and products.  When they do this we all benefit.  Amd occasionally, mistakes are made.  The test is how people and companies respond to the mistakes.  Will we own our mistakes, make amends, learn from the mistakes and move forward?  Or do we want to prosecute and persecute those that made the mistake?  If companies like Asrock were more forthcoming in publicly owning the mistake, then it might diffuse things.

Different minimum voltages needed for different memory vendors and specs of the kit, not just the memory voltage but the VSOC voltage for the memory controller on the CPU.

It’s possible to enforce it but a lot of effort needs to go into testing and verifying minimum voltages needed needed on every single board and every single memory kit. And it leads to more product RMAs when just a tiny bit more voltage is needed to make a certain kit stable but the board isn’t giving it. IMO they should be making the effort though. Could cause increased costs but that’s better than ruining reputation frying chips and getting all that bad press.  Not saying the current situation with the mobo vendors is OK, they seem pretty lazy about setting too high voltages, especially for VSOC, when XMP is on, and just calling it fine and shipping it.

A lot of chip(let) to chip(let) communication is already covered by ECC or at least EDC, and error counters are commonly available, they are just not properly (especially not uniformly) exposed.  For example on modern AMD CPUs, increasing FCLK too high can result in experiencing stuttering, making it highly likely that the IFOP is protected by some EDC. EDC error counters being exposed to users could be helpful with treating errors before they turn into crashing, and they could be also useful for faster and more reliable stability tests.  Then there's that whole ECC memory issue of reliable memory not considered being important for regular users.

It does take time to identify the real cause of the problem.  As I said, if a large percentage of boards had been affected, then I believe the response would have been different.  If you were affected by this problem, then it was catastrophic.  I don't dispute that.  There were thousands of other Asrock board owners with 9800x3d chips who were interested but not impacted.

Even without going into the details of hidden tech info, just consider the much simpler localization problem, users robbed of the opportunity to learn English. The degraded language skills as a result were already visible online several years ago, but I've started seeing more and more non-English posts/comments in otherwise English environments, seemingly with the expectation of others using translators (or does ""new"" Reddit automatically do it?).  Of course there are people who don't even try, but a lot of people learned not by actively seeking out knowledge, but just solving challenges on their way towards a goal. When an Apple phone user (think of all the tablet kids) isn't even allowed to know that files exist, or a gaming console user isn't allowed to run anything not related to gaming on what's essentially a locked down x86 PC, then how are they supposed to learn without even knowing what they are missing out on?  Hell, I'll go as far as claiming that curiosity about technology is even punished, and not even culturally like kids calling you a nerd. Can't even do a lot of tasks on a PC anymore because a lot of services are phone-only, and then it turns out that the phone crapp isn't willing to run on a non-stock OS. Why learn and experiment when anything else than just going with the flow gets you in trouble, and culturally we seem to be in a phase of the majority of the people being okay with everything getting dumbed down, users being expected to just consume without thinking too much?  We had a golden age of computing where people could (and had to) learn quite a bit about technology to get to their goals, and many people could do so with having to learn English first. Nowadays people are funneled towards entertainment/consuming with just a few clicks/taps, and even if anything goes wrong, the technical details are often hidden, only presenting a ""Something went wrong"" or ""Oopsie woopsie"" page.

The X3D v-cache does absolutely nothing to speed that workload. Productivity apps generally want as many cores as you can give them. The X3D chips only make sense if you NEED the v-cache for gaming.

The 14600K is only $150 right now via Newegg and comes with BF6 for ""free"".  **Effectively $80 for the CPU itself assuming you were planning on buying the game at launch.**  Considering he's playing on 1440p, the FPS difference won't really be super high unless its some CPU bound esports game or ms flight sim.  This is obvious due to cache.  People might argue AM5 upgradability, but this only makes sense if you're planning on keeping a platform for like 5+ years.  Selling off the mobo and CPU every 2-3 years is more logical IMO.  The 14600K performs a little better than the current AMD 8 core single CCD's ATM for MT related stuff.  I wouldn't exactly look at this like a 6 core CPU.. It's generally competitive with a 12900K due to clock/ring speed differences, minus some MT performance being left off the table.  There's nothing wrong with AMD, but if OP is planning on buying BF6.. it's kind of a no brainer to go 14600K with a half decent board.   He should be able to net min $200\~ in the next few years when he wants to upgrade.  Power draw in most games is actually within 40W of each other when left stock... Only outlier is likely battlefield where the game will leverage a full CPU and draw like 150W max.. but it's really only this game engine.  I'll go against the grain a little.. I don't think this CPU runs hot.. at least relative to the 8+8 alder/raptor configs.. which tend to hit 100C pretty easily.  Edit: just realized hes in Europe.

I also love how everyone parrots ""spend more - who cares how much, because you can upgrade on the same socket and save a few dollars!"" Like bro, save the money up front instead, get a great performer now, and just upgrade when you need it. It comes out to similar cost in the end, since everything will be cheaper (ie cost / frame) in 5 years. If you need to upgrade sooner than that, you probably made compromises in your initial CPU choice, or you are an enthusiast and wouldn't be making this post.    As I prepare for the downvotes, I will add I feel good about 14600k, but not 14700k or higher.

AMD,nd076qt,Thats normal temperatures. Your cpu is designed to boost as high as possible. Better cooling = higher boost clocks. Theres no need or reason to do anything about it.  No amount of cooling changes how much heat your pc outputs to your room. Thats not how that works ... at all.,pcmasterrace,2025-09-08 00:47:14,22
AMD,nd08jkc,"It is a common misconception that your CPU temp being lower means your PC will heat up your room less. Your CPU produces heat, and the coolers job is to pull that heat away from the CPU and transfer it to the air around the PC. If your CPU is running cooler, that actually means more heat energy is being transferred to the air around the PC meaning your room will actually heat up more!   Also, compared to the CPU your GPU is likely producing much more heat. Heat is almost directly related to how many watts the device uses, so your 140W cpu vs your 400W gpu means the gpu is making a lot more heat. Really the only thing you can do is limit how much power the pc is using to run games. FPS limiting your game is an easy way to do this. Otherwise, you need to find a way to get better airflow in the room your PC is in to move the heat away from you.",pcmasterrace,2025-09-08 00:55:24,4

AMD,nd0l6ch,"My 5800x3d stock runs low 90s with stress tests and 70s/80s in cpu intensive games. With pbo with a negative offset of -30, I get low 80s in stress tests and 60/70s in games. I would look into trying that. This is on a 280mm nzxt kraken x62 with noctua chromax fans running between 40-90%, depending on cpu Temps. The 3dcache on x3d processors is stacked intop of the cpu under the IHS, so it causes those chips to run warmer, which is why you'd see higher Temps. I understand it's not a concern unless you're pushing over 90c as that's the tjmax, and you start to see heavy throttling. My bios/uefi is where I did the undervolting/pbo.

Its completely normal and just the cpu.  I would suggest looking at running a -20 or so in curve optimiser in the bios and turning on pbo.   Also, you prob need 1 exhaust fan no on the radiator in that case to get some of the hot air out of the system but then again you would lose the positive pressure so would def recommend the pbo and curve optimiser.",pcmasterrace,2025-09-08 04:28:03,1

Then, all of a sudden, ATI comes up with 9700Pro and blasts all the nVidia cards into oblivion. After that, next few years nVidia struggled with keeping up with ATI as their FX cards came with loud fans (those turbines) and marginally better performance if any at all.

AMD,nckmydw,"I'd go with the AMD AM5 socket option. Cheaper upgrade option in the future due to not needing a new motherboard, and it avoids the risk of Intel's degradation issues. There are BIOS update fixes for it, but the degradation isn't just a software issue, it's also a physical design defect/flaw. So I don't trust that a BIOS update resolves the issue good enough to prevent the CPU from still degrading after a few years.

AMD,nckrvp5,"It depends on whether your production apps can leverage the E-cores effectively. If they can the 14600k will be faster, though whether that makes up for the reliability problems and dead platform would depend on if you really need your school projects to compile 20% faster.   For gaming the performance difference between the two is much smaller as games don't effectively use the E-cores and probably not hugely relevant given what GPUs you could get on a $1400 budget for the entire system.",pcmasterrace,2025-09-05 15:58:27,3

The Steam survey is asking *every single device* who they are, it's simply not possible for Valve to know every single device in the entire world by their hardware IDs and whatnot. This is why there exists a standard way in which the devices themselves announce who they are to the operating system (via drivers), and then Steam asks the OS what devices it has.  This is assuming that the other person is correct in their initial claim of ""*a bug with AMD putting generic descriptions into their driver inf files*"" in the first place, if it's something else entirely then obviously the responsibility can shift. For example some people in the comments here have been saying that AMD reports 9070 XT properly, but Steam incorrectly picks the integrated GPU instead, in which case the fault would again be Valve's.

But to be clear, this isn't even just AMDs fault - there are many other non-AMD drivers where you run into similar issues because Microsoft is slower than their cycle or w/e. So clearly, the way Windows is getting its drivers is flawed. Nvidia has no issue because they effectively set the standard.  But either way, Windows should not just kill working drivers in the background. If Windows recognises an issue with an unrecognised driver, it could just open a pop-up and ask ""You are using an unrecognised driver. Install the Windows recommended driver?

AMD,nc6zp7o,"Maybe so. But I don't think it is a surprise that AMD didn't gain any market share for that particular period. The 9070 series launched near the end of Q1, and went out of stock after a few days of it's launch. This lasted quite some time. In that time the 5090/5080 started to gain more stock, the 5070ti was above MSRP but available . The 5070 launched and nobody was interested. AIB's had to cut the 5070 price for it to sell. In fact, it was the first GPU to drop below MSRP. This was the only reason for it selling, as everything else from AMD side was not available. Then the 5060ti is in the market for couple months before the 9060xt launches near the end of Q2.   So Q1/Q2 was never a settled period for anyone trying to buy a 9000 series card. The only real option was a Nvidia offering. And most consumers will rather stick to what they know than wait for something they never experienced.  Q3 is the only period where every GPU is easily accessible. So, I believe end of year will show a different data.   AMD has to take some blame for postponing the initial launch and marketing ect. But  AIB's also play a part. I see their part  as market manipulation. Some of the prices they set was just ridiculous.

A widely reported outlier and current AAA title is AC Shadows, non-XT is significantly faster than 3080 but I have seen this sort of outliers in older games, my example is ME Andromeda.

AMD,ncub7am,"I'm well aware of all the things you mentioned, my point is the other components are not significantly affected. Even with the hotter Hynix chips I'm running around 65-70c core with a +10 hotspot delta on a 2-slot card (Reaper) with the stock fan curve (meaning it could be cooler if needed with a more aggressive curve). That's under high-stress tests...under standard games I play it often barely crests 55c core (same hotspot delta), maybe 60c on a warm day.    Meaning even with the hotter chips, the main components (which are warmer due to the warmer nearby memory) are running 20-30c under their limit. Running cooler isn't going to make a noticeable improvement on component lifetime for my usages.    Yes, there are benefits to having cooler components. My point is that difference is small enough that it's going to make less difference to my usage than having the faster card.    Maybe if you were an extreme overclocking squeezing every bit of performance out the extra 3c core temp savings would be enough to help you do so, but it's not going to make a difference for most.    EDIT: Lastly, a 3c difference you're seeing on the core is within normal variance. It could be 3c cooler because of the memory, or it could just be 3c cooler regardless of the memory. Unless you have a way to control for minor manufacturing differences within the components there's no way to be sure that difference is due to the slower memory.",AMD,2025-09-07 02:50:16,2

Good for very short bursts of usage of the peak memory bandwidth.

As you said in your last sentence, the hardware can't drop dirty data when it wants to reuse a spot in the cache; the dirty data must be written back to memory first and that takes time.  It would be faster to simply skip that step by having the data already be clean, and that's what this patent tries to do by preemptively cleaning.   Note that preemptive cleaning will sometimes be wasted: when the cached data gets written again before it needs to be evicted from the cache to make room for different data.  Because of that, preemptive cleaning could easily hurt performance if it consumed a resource which otherwise would have been used for something else.

(because when they did, things would break, and.. again, not enough guru to go around and fix it.)  And I'm talking like.. Bios firmwares designed in the late 80's making it all the way up to the 2010+ era this way.  Oh, you are running a modern day multi-core omgwtfbbq 2 ghz monster cpu with a modern motherboard?  Don't look now, but under the hood all that 80's 286-era ISA support is still there. and IDE 1, and serial 1.. and ..Back in 2005, you just never see it in the options because its been visually turned off (as in, its just not on the menu, even if under the hood its propping up all the modern stuff stapled to its head.)    It finally started coming undone a while back, and was getting so bad it was impossible to (reliably/safely) implement new standards or technology anymore because there was just too much garbage under the hood being in the way. So finally a new 'standard bios' was cooked up, using modern tooling and dev standards, and thus came the new age of all the nice shiny new bios features erupting out of the woodwork every few months for the next five to eight years or so..   And now here we are, able to do wildly weird shit like.. use a mouse, and get an actual GUI in the bios, and even load a micro OS and, and so forth.  A lot of folks around here are too young to know this (fuck, I'm getting old..), but between the early 90's to like.. 2010 or so? Every bios around barely changed in appearance or functionality between each other. And it was all staples, tape and glue sticking it all together.

L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.

While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1

Any other driver updates or software installs happened after I had already noticed the problem, and were initiated trying to solve the problem  \- There is no visible damage to my pc or wires  \- my Bios is up to date, and aside from turning on resizable BAR months ago for my GPU, my bios settings are default. I reset to default and turned resizable BAR on again just to be sure, and the issue still occurred.  \- I have not, mostly because it would be a hassle and because the CPU has remained very cool. I have manually overclocked it as a temporary solution to the problem and even under these conditions it is averaging 35-40 degrees Celsius when idle and hovers around 50 degrees when under stress  \- While the issue did not occur in Safe Mode, I am not sure which program is causing the throttling. I have disabled all installed startup programs and still get throttled.  \- No unusual processes pop up right after boot, though the sum of all processes hits 15% CPU utilization, stays there for a while and then the CPU throttling begins (all happens in less than 30 seconds after boot). I could see what happens after disabling even the security related startup programs and see if there is any difference  \- I pass the PDT tests but I have abysmal performance on various benchmark tests, and the PDT takes a long time to complete. Overclocking leads to more expected results.",Intel,2025-08-25 00:28:15,1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue. Keep me posted on what you find with that CPU usage spike and reliability monitor - those are likely our smoking guns!",Intel,2025-08-25 21:12:03,1
AMD,navgo8f,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification. For anyone building new systems, Intel recommends using RST instead of VROC, but existing X299 users can continue using VROC with supported drives from the qualified vendor list. ***Support is now limited to sustaining mode with no new features or drive certifications planned, as confirmed in the support article you referenced.***",Intel,2025-08-27 01:43:49,1

The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period.

Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work.

AMD,mo7yliu,"Yeah, but GPUs and WiFi chips are both part of the intel package, even if they dropped discrete gpus they still need to develop igpus and ai accelerators, so it's probably not actually that big of a cost",Intel,2025-04-21 07:23:18,1

AMD,mny05l2,"Overhead issue is when we use older cpus like 9400 or 3600  If intel is to make high end GPU , it would be obviously bought buy those having good enough cpu as well like 5700x or 12600k  It would be stupid imo to buy a high end GPU (whether it's amd .intel or nvidia ) with older CPUs  The real reason could be potential b770 wasn't giving satisfactory performance uplift to be considered as mid-high end GPU that's why they cancelled b770 and now looking forward c770 i.e celestial",Intel,2025-04-19 15:56:28,3
