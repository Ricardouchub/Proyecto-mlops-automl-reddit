We're talking about the B390. The one Intel is using in its presentations. None of your examples are B390. The article is about the B-series. We shouldn't use the B390's performance numbers to compare to Strix Point, but only use the prices of the non B-series.

You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",hardware,2026-01-14 16:13:54,-1,Negative,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.989419), 'word': 'GN', 'start': 468, 'end': 470}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",hardware,2026-01-13 15:59:39,-4,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76293916), 'word': 'B31', 'start': 18, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7452721), 'word': 'A31', 'start': 76, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7529128), 'word': 'Al', 'start': 91, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9379297), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 194, 'end': 200}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9643023), 'word': 'GTX 1650', 'start': 383, 'end': 391}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88162076), 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 520, 'end': 529}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99752444), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 596, 'end': 601}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7194058), 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 617, 'end': 627}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.55869925), 'word': 'Celes', 'start': 632, 'end': 637}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7116459), 'word': '##tial', 'start': 637, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76397717), 'word': 'A31', 'start': 772, 'end': 775}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9997087), 'word': 'Australia', 'start': 829, 'end': 838}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9302061), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1243}]",Tópico 4

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

Intel,nywgma9,"QC last year had a bad product.  It was competitive vs AMD and Intel but Qc was selling those for 50% less than Intel or AMD chips. OEMs at first decided to price these at Intel prices then it settled at Intel -100/200€   QC laptops still sold what QC and partners expected and OEMs are increasing new models for X2 (design wins went from 60 to 100+)   X2 has a 25% advantage vs Panther Lake and it will still be cheaper because QC is an underdog. If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029.

Intel,ny0aepy,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant.

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300.

Intel,o0v4u9k,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.

They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing.

But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Intel,nymut0x,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Intel,o2dekrv,"I need help! My rig was having issues mounting drives, and crashing, and hang ups, so I figured my 13900k was finally dying (as expected from Intel). So I bought a 14900k and that wouldn't boot even with the latest bios. I had an Auros Z790 elite AX motherboard with 96gb Corsair vengeance 5200mhz DDR5 ram, and RTX 4090. So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now. When I press shut down, my screens turn off and it seems like it's off, but my fans and light and everything else are still running. So I have to hold the power button to shut it down.   I am suspicious of my PSU because I think it could cause some of these issues, but I've had this PSU only since 2023 and it's a Corsair HX1000i.   The only things I kept from my old build were the PSU, GPU, and ram. And considering both systems were having issues, it makes sense that maybe one of them is acting up. But I don't really know if that explains all the problems I've been having.   I've updated the Bios, I've reinstalled windows, I've tweaked power plans and bios settings, reseated hardware, and I feel like I'm just on a wild goose chase.

Every time I launch Fortnite, at some point during the game (Could be seconds or minutes into the game, in the menu, between games - anything), both my monitors go completely black and I can hear the game for bit and then my computer totally crashes. This has only happened in Fortnite besides one instance when it crashed in the Epic Games LAUNCHER.  I have to restart my computer each time this happens and 50% of the time my GPU disappears from task manager, and I have to reinstall my drivers to make it show up again. (@ w @\* )  The last time this all happened, Fortnite had uninstalled ITSELF when I restarted my computer and I had to manually delete each file and redownload the launcher alongside the game itself.

DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.  I remember you mentioning on the AMD forums once that you want to be hit up about VR related issues - but really I didn't know how else I would reach out to you.",AMD,2026-01-22 23:12:00,3,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.90489936), 'word': 'Direct', 'start': 123, 'end': 129}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96175134), 'word': 'to', 'start': 130, 'end': 132}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67439824), 'word': 'Display', 'start': 133, 'end': 140}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75485855), 'word': '##mode', 'start': 147, 'end': 151}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6974963), 'word': 'DisplayP', 'start': 172, 'end': 180}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.55366564), 'word': '##ort', 'start': 180, 'end': 183}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.43272153), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 184, 'end': 186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.76523507), 'word': 'DirectM', 'start': 208, 'end': 215}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64877534), 'word': 'SteamVR', 'start': 250, 'end': 257}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6261666), 'word': 'Pi', 'start': 604, 'end': 606}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5366219), 'word': '##max', 'start': 606, 'end': 609}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45680514), 'word': '##P', 'start': 609, 'end': 610}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78368396), 'word': 'Directmode', 'start': 792, 'end': 802}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5629746), 'word': 'R', 'start': 992, 'end': 993}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8583349), 'word': 'Directmo', 'start': 1069, 'end': 1077}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6303355), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1115, 'end': 1117}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.540306), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1164, 'end': 1165}]",Tópico 3

Audio quality, specifically, is still the best I've heard from any AMD driver to date.  I thought maybe the fresh install itself might have been the reason for the better audio quality, so I installed an adrenaline driver that I'm very familiar with, and was disappointed because the audio was noticeably worse.

The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks.

Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.

Intel,o46e0sj,"First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to listen/read and look into this, I appreciate it greatly. I'm not sure why, but it seems your reply about the issue possibly being related to ISR isn't showing up on here for some reason. Could just be the site being dumb.  So, the audio differences I'm hearing aren't related to functionality, or the ability to playback audio without interrupts (dropouts, clicking, popping, choppiness). That has been flawless, for me, which is great. I'm referring to audio fidelity differences between drivers.  For instance, I uninstalled the driver I've recently been testing (25.12.1) via DDU and listened to some music with just the Microsoft display adapter being used as the driver. The audio sounded pretty normal again, and what I would consider correct/good. I then ran windows update, and it thankfully installed the 32.0.21030.2001 driver. Listened to some music, and as I heard before, it's still the best sounding driver I've used. The only other driver I've used that comes close is 25.1.1. That one has some slight issues with audio fidelity and image quality, but it was close enough to correct at the time.   The only thing I can think of that sounds similar and would describe what I'm hearing with these newer drivers is when you have a bit-depth and sampling rate mismatch between your music and output device. I have my audio devices set to 16/44.1 in windows, but with these newer drivers (25.9.1-25.12.1), the audio sounds as if the bit depth and sampling rate are set to higher values, even though they aren't. It's extremely strange, and sort of difficult to explain, but that's what I'm hearing.   The frustrating and unfortunate reality that might be coming into play here, is that differences could also vary between systems. So, a bad sounding driver on my system (25.9.1), might possibly sound fine or even good on a different system with different components.  It could also be caused by or related to interactions between code or the registry entries of different programs on the system interacting with drivers, but that's above my level of understanding. I'm just a dude who is noticing stuff (audio & video) and would like others who are smarter and more skilled to look into why there are differences in the first place and what could potentially be causing them.    By the way, you guys have been doing a great job with the video/image quality of these recent drivers. They are substantially better and closer to reference than everything previously released. 25.9.1 and 25.11.1 are the best drivers I've tested/used, in regards to video & image quality.",AMD,2026-02-08 01:11:28,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96877897), 'word': 'ISR', 'start': 194, 'end': 197}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9401379), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 677, 'end': 686}]",Tópico 3

Intel,o4hted2,"Ah gotcha. To be fair, I would say the differences between these more recent drivers are much smaller now compared to the drivers released in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Especially trying each driver from 25.9.1 to 25.12.1, specifically the audio, seems to get better with each release. It seems the team, or someone, also heard what I did with the 25.9.1 driver and tried to fix/improve it with each subsequent driver release.   I haven't tried 26.1.1 yet, but I will to test and compare. I'll also install LatencyMon to see if there is a correlation between good/bad audio and latency.  It really seems like the team that handles the display/video side of the drivers has mostly corrected the issues that were present with the old drivers (video output format/range, luminance levels, gamma curve, sharpness, white point, grayscale & color accuracy). There are still differences, but I wouldn't get too worried about it.  The oddball out of the bunch is 25.8.1. The audio is actually pretty good, but different. Sounds as if there is a surround sound effect turned on, or the audio output format is surround sound instead of stereo. It works really well for gaming, but music sounds a little strange. Due to the overall frequency response balance, it's honestly not bad. If it wasn't for the video/image quality side of things, I would probably use that driver.   On the video side, I think there is something wrong with the gamma curve and color. The gamma curve tracks higher (darker) in the lower luminance range. The white point and grayscale are more blue than neutral gray, and the overall color saturation is reduced, as if the color gamut clamp in the adrenaline software is being used. I checked to see if this was the case with my colorimeter, but the color gamut is normal for my monitor, so the actual color volume isn't being reduced.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9604742), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393346), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7001686), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 5

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682612), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658414), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568305), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114903), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8751363), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80407614), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83806515), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147056), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005272), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6974834), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5886638), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113516), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741815), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076934), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363589), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78076094), 'word': 'YouTube', 'start': 186, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.632216), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 202, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8987949), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.5258395), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 211, 'end': 213}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71377695), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 213, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56497097), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 266, 'end': 268}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",AMD,2024-04-01 02:18:57,29,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9687024), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91567665), 'word': 'I', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9579423), 'word': 'M', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6767614), 'word': 'N', 'start': 78, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6967306), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 79, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8865074), 'word': '##DI', 'start': 81, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98826766), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 142, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8187025), 'word': 'VFIO', 'start': 220, 'end': 224}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004071), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 270, 'end': 273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97644997), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 355, 'end': 358}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78370035), 'word': 'V', 'start': 478, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9868846), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81203324), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 637, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40551126), 'word': 'M', 'start': 679, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7868688), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 721, 'end': 727}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6571528), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 746, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99238694), 'word': 'Debian', 'start': 835, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86615723), 'word': 'Proxmox', 'start': 865, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936753), 'word': 'N', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81987065), 'word': '##utanix', 'start': 906, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9508744), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 923, 'end': 929}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9956404), 'word': 'Broadcom', 'start': 941, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98821133), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71325445), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9346571), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1279, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91439736), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86589456), 'word': 'Spice', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6743293), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.77185565), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041886), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891967), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808144), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224165), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943218), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152326), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277302), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415535), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8893401), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.985618), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676908), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811378), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72003263), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515258), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5171998), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5073669), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 1

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely. And the thing I hate even more then just waiting forever for a fix is being stuck in limbo not knowing.",AMD,2024-04-01 14:28:37,22,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96660787), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 405, 'end': 407}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9771786), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 552, 'end': 555}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6806259), 'word': 'N', 'start': 653, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48324648), 'word': '##vid', 'start': 654, 'end': 657}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9874266), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1376, 'end': 1379}]",Tópico 3

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

AMD,o6rhmee,"I fully agree with this, and that is what I thought as well as that is the only logical conclusion of why FSR4 INT8 wasn't released, or acknowledged by AMD to this day.  The issue here is that *I* as a customer will look on the track record of the both corporations, and compare how long they support their GPUs either with Drivers, or Features, which AMD is absolutely lacking, and in the last 6 months alone convinced me to never look at AMD seriously at all.  Last year I played a few Triple-A games on my RX 6600 (it was a temporary replacement after my GTX 1080 died), and FF7 Rebirth & The Last of Us Part 2 were both having driver issues *for months*, and this exact GPU was part of the ""misclick"" when they announced that they're dropping the driver support. A GPU that was supposed to be a newer GTX 1080, but *better* because of active driver support. A GPU that was only 4 years old when they announced a discontinuation, while GTX 1080 stopped receiving updates in October 2025. 9 Years Old Graphic Card.  Absolutely fucking crazy work AMD...  Whoever that was who made the comment that AMD is just selling a future features during their presentations for thier GPUs for right, and people who look for an upgrade should really look at both NVidia and AMD, and buy whatever is *currently* available for both of these cards, and not *what* will be available in the future.

For developers using DLSS, they only have to target the most recent version to have it work on every RTX-branded GPU released since 2018. Good on Nvidia for making it this simple.  And what about for FSR? Well, it's actually the same. Enabling FSR 3.1 will support every Radeon RX 5000 and newer GPU released since 2019, as well as the RX 590 released in 2018. Doing so will allow the AMD Driver to support FSR 4 on newer GPUs with no additional work from the developer.  Optionally, the developer can also support FSR 1, which would add basic upscaling support for the Radeon RX 400/500 series and the GeForce GTX 10/16 series, released from 2016.  So it's not nearly as bad as I thought that it was. However, it would be ideal if AMD would add a driver toggle for users of the 590 through 7000 series to allow them to turn on FSR 4 INT 8 mode at their own risk, giving better quality for lesser performance. Even better, allow the driver to detect games that support DLSS but not FSR 3.1/4, and allow you to turn on DLSS in that game, which would then force FSR 4, Ala optiscaler on Windows and multiple tools on macOS that convert a Windows game's DLSS to MetalFX.",hardware,2026-02-28 20:47:30,6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7428396), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 49, 'end': 52}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.36198005), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 155, 'end': 157}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9651689), 'word': 'RTX', 'start': 235, 'end': 238}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9309576), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 280, 'end': 286}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91814697), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 334, 'end': 337}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8754346), 'word': 'FSR 3', 'start': 378, 'end': 383}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5879068), 'word': '1', 'start': 384, 'end': 385}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9464994), 'word': 'Radeon RX 5000', 'start': 405, 'end': 419}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5566809), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 430, 'end': 432}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9847895), 'word': 'RX', 'start': 470, 'end': 472}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.42295977), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 519, 'end': 521}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.767178), 'word': 'FSR 4', 'start': 541, 'end': 546}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9528797), 'word': 'FSR 1', 'start': 649, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93332785), 'word': 'Radeon RX 400', 'start': 704, 'end': 717}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.89143074), 'word': 'GeForce GTX 10', 'start': 737, 'end': 751}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98076916), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 866, 'end': 869}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8395121), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 962, 'end': 965}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4342402), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1103, 'end': 1105}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.72197235), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 1116, 'end': 1119}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.43226576), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1152, 'end': 1154}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.68238705), 'word': 'F', 'start': 1194, 'end': 1195}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7731107), 'word': '##SR', 'start': 1195, 'end': 1197}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7724067), 'word': 'Al', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1203}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95246685), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1219, 'end': 1226}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62127453), 'word': 'macOS', 'start': 1249, 'end': 1254}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9899345), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1270, 'end': 1277}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.679991), 'word': 'MetalF', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1299}]",Tópico 3

Previously it was maximum 2 years, unless it's sport-sims and some rare licensed AAA that eventually had totally separate game versions.  This gen it was profitable only because transition to nextgen was ""sabotaged"" by semiconductor shortages + Covid, that stretched the development cycles of games that were supposed to be released even before PS5.  Of course if we, as consumers, and big business will mentally take it as a norm, greedy corp will always be happy to sell dated lastgen games as ""nextgen"" and add +10$ to price for unlocked FPS but should we as consumers defend this and accept, while having dated systems, AI, same dead open worlds but with fake 4K label and be happy?  A lot of true-nextgen games that came out only on new hardware had exceptional sales, despite not having lastgen port. Take a look at early PS4, PS3 and PS2 games. Magically, earlier nextgen-only games generated great margin and motivated people to rush stores to play a GTAIII, Gears of War, Halo 3, Unch 2 on respective consoles.  Of course if platformholders themselves won't push their new hardware, the motivation to get nextgen ASAP will be low, and less people will buy it. It all depends purely on publishers and platform holders. It's them who establish such vectors more than consumers themselves.  In the end of the day, for many the lack of true nextgen games will be a good motivation to move to PC then, because people will already be off the nextgen hook, hence will have even more hesitation whether they actually need a console when it's already in its mid-cycle and wont amaze as much. A lot of my PSN friends were up until 2024 because ""why buying PS6 to have the same games"" yet when they received PS5 finally, nextgen excitement was absent. I mean not as big as witnessing when hardware is actually new and delivers groundbreaking games.

PC is beginning to reach dimishing returns but console, hell nah.  Should be competent at PT even. Watch the Project Amethyst vid + indication from AMD R&D. They mentioned path tracing multiple times + moving shading work to neural shaders (ML) like NRC, which they claim is only the beginning. Radiance cores (BVH traversal processing in HW) likely includes many changes, eclipses 50 series in patent filings. Flexible and efficient data structures (BVH) can mean many things but mostly likely related to CBLAS + PTLAS (RTX Mega geo) on steroids: DGF + clustering + DMM (done properly this time). Also beyond 50 series, but needs game adoption to fully benefit. Shading and traversal will be tackled holistically.  ML Hardware is gonna eclipse 50 series. DSMEM + TBC analogs + shared L1 (there's a 2020 research paper about this) = massively parallel DNN processing + GEMM accel. Rumours suggest 2X dense FP8 gain vs RDNA 4 (\~1200TF PS6 numbers). With some smart FP4 encoding (like NVFP4) that's a 4X gain over 50 series using DLSS 4.5 or RDNA 4. Add smarter processing (bigger tiles) + cachemem and execution overhaul that's an effective perf multiplier on top. Best case it could be approaching an order of magnitude increase over RDNA 4 for the compute section of ML work with ideal SW+HW co-design (PSSR3+ + FSR5+).  So it's gonna crunch through neural shaders effortlessly + be able to do things with ML image processing (SR + RR) that just isn't possible today.  And for the long term I haven't even mentioned the extreme software-hardware codesign for work graphs (there are more than a dozen of patents related to this). That'll impact the entire rendering pipeline, but especially divergent work such as ray tracing. Forget about DX11 and DX12, this is the biggest change since programmable shaders in early 2000s.

I want to expand on what you said.  Last gen's CPU for the PS4 and Xbox One was such relative arse, that the Xbox One X, the most powerful console of that generation, has a GPU that is significantly better than the one in the Xbox Series S, and despite that, the Series S has better gaming performance. Last gen's consoles were absolutely CPU limited, so many games targeted the best visuals that they could at 30fps, just to make some use of the GPU.  I agree, it was bad.  > Many advanced games this gen wouldn't be possible on PS4 by any means even in the most potato mode possible.  This is true of virtually any game that launches as not being cross-gen. And the games that are cross-gen, well, you get to see the sacrifices made. This is also why developers hate the Xbox approach so much, because the Series S is closer to last gen than current gen. It was the reason why the Xbox version of BG 3 was delayed beyond the PS5 release.  > Your example about low vs high is only relevant if you make lastgen game at its core and only in terms of graphics.

So DC is where margins are, with cyclical and highly unpredictable demand patterns, and usually limited volumes. Client is where the volumes of the products they make actually reliably sell.

AMD,o6o95rx,"Steve raises a good point, after building my own desktops for 23 years (and ironically all of those being on Intel platforms) I am having a super hard time envisioning Intel managing to stick to a single socket for just four years, certainly forgot about 6-8. Intel doesn't have the clout or the performance lead to get away with two year, even two generation sockets anymore. And I say that even despite Intel's new modular chip approach, which would allow Intel to maintain socket compatibility more easily than it could with monolithic chips. Intel has yet to commit to even a mid-length socket plan.   On the flipside, given the bulk of the volume of Intel's chips are sold through OEMs how much does the DIY segment ultimately matter? OEMs have to buy all the various parts anyway so what does it matter if the platform changes yearly. And it has even less bearing on servers. Seems like another decade of this could see Intel as the small player in the DIY space yet still remain the vast majority of OEM offerings.  My previous desktop was Haswell, the last DDR3 generation. Quite literally between the 4th gen and 9th gen there just wasn't a point to upgrade. I started getting antsy by 10th gen, but the 11th gen disaster that was Rocket Lake nixed buying into another dead socket platform. So after seeing how stable and long-term AM4 support had been, combined with the incredible 5800X3D capstone for the socket I was sold on investing into AM5. Sure DDR5 was pricey at launch but I'd already skipped the DDR4 generation entirely. And since X3D chips mitigate the effects of slower memory one can continue to use the same memory across the life of the system without having to replace it which more than makes up for the early upfront cost. Picking up a drop-in CPU upgrade in 4-6 years meant that for the early adopters one AM5 system can effectively last a full decade without compromise, for only the cost of a second CPU.  The third angle is that all the AM5 early adopters are now sitting in the catbird seat, even in spite of the AI shitfest dragging everything down into a cesspool of misery they can pick up a Zen 6 X3D chip for a drop in upgrade and remain entirely unaffected. Clearly the expectation we've all held about how things will remain normal and that hardware will always be getting cheaper (sans GPUs) probably needs to be reassessed. Sure prices will probably return to normal (or even crash given all the fab capacity being built today that will be online by 2030), but by building a system you won't have to replace means builders won't be exposed to begin with when the next crazy thing comes along. We've already had two crypto bubbles, covid supply disruptions, two separate trade tariff wars, and now we have AI induced mass inflation. All in the span of **one** decade.

AMD,o6rgyxw,"Great video, these revisions/retrospectives are some of my favourite HUB content. In spite of being very relevant, so few outlets do them - and nobody seems to do them as well.  AMD made huge gains within AM4 for sure, with the fantastic X3D CPUs to finish with a dominant gaming platform. What this video doesn't even highlight, is that when I bought a brand new system in mid 2021 (before the release of Alder Lake), AM4 was still straight up the best value for an all new gaming platform, and I bought it without any reasonable expectation of upgrading.  I feel Steve kind of glosses over AM5's expected upgrade path towards the end, where he does rightfully mentions that an in platform upgrade path mostly makes sense if you start on the lower end. Even now (or at least before RAM prices blew up) getting a 7500/7600X the upgrade path was a huge consideration as the 11800X3D (or whatever the name will be) should be a huge in platform gain (though nothing like a 1700X to 5800X3D). If you get in on AM5 now with a 9800X3D, I don't think the remaining platform longevity will ever provide a significant in socket upgrade.  Lastly, Steve mentions his surprise at the high end 7800X3D and 9800X3D being 2 of the top 3 best selling CPUs on amazon. While I do think the hype and FOMO are a part of it, with the increasingly high GPU prices we've gotten used to, and especially alongside obscene RAM and NVME prices we've had as of late, the added cost to the total system for going to an X3D CPU just isn't that big a part of overall system cost anymore. If you spend $800 on a GPU and $350 on 32GB of RAM and $250 for 2 tb of storage, how much is that $200 extra for the best gaming CPU money can buy? Purely speculative, but that's my take.  Either way I'm looking forward to what zen 6 will bring.

Assuming you upgrade every 5 years, is swapping out a motherboard really that big of a deal, both in terms of cost and time spent? I honestly don't see a world in which it is.  Taking price into consideration, the logic kind of undercuts itself. If you’re upgrading every 1-2 years, you’re likely not that budget-constrained to begin with, but an upgradable platform indeed makes sense in that case. If you are budget-conscious, the rational move is to hold onto your as-is system for longer, and at that point, a full platform upgrade often makes sense anyway because you’re getting meaningful improvements beyond just the CPU.

AMD,o6sruwb,"They're making the same mistakes over and over again.    There is no real doubt that the upgrade itself is cheaper, but there are a couple of problems in their takes:  1. They conveniently chose their upgrade times to fit their narrative. An upgrade at a different time would not have been as good of a deal.   2. The difference between the 1700X and 7700k was bigger than between the 14600k and 5800X3D according to their own testing? Why not use the part that was closer in performance?  3. If you bought Zen 1, you bought a 300 series motherboard and slower RAM with it. An AM4 upgrade would also have required a RAM upgrade, negating a lot of what you save.  4. Early 300 series boards, especially B350 had a lot of trouble with RAM and there are a lot of tests that show that modern AM4 CPUs don't run at their full potential and can't use memory that is as good.    You lose out on PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 too and are stuck with horrendously outdated I/O.    Why didn't they test the 5800X3D or 5700X on an actual B350 board?    They're whole argument is based on running a Zen 3 CPU with faster RAM on a different mainboard.   And that's just on their methodology.   The more general ""problems"" with platform longevity:  \- Using AM4 as an example is bad, because it only looks so good because Zen 1 sucked. It was overhyped, buying in on the ""the future will be multithreaded"" narrative and that's it. In gaming, Zen 1 was closer to Ivy Bridge or Haswell than Skylake.   \- They never asnwer the question on how much to factor it in in buying decision  \- They completely ignore that chipsets matter too, AMD only allowed Zen 3 much later on early AM4 boards (most oof which had some performance regression)  \- There is no guarantee in longevity. AMD always phrases it in a way that they're not liable for anything. They made the same promises about Threadripper and broke them thrice. After the first broken promise their new promises were even stronger. Why buy into a promise that the vendor will happily break if it benefits them?  \- There is no guarantee about performance. What if all new CPUs are a Zen 5% scenario all over again? You don't know before.   \- You still pay for it. In theory, a longer platform support is good but do they really think ""intel"" does it because they're greedy and AMD doesn't because they're friend?    In reality, neither AMD nor intel are really affected by that directly, motherboard vendors are. Do people really think that motherboard vendors are happy with having to support a product much longer and provide updates (which costs money) while lowering their own revenue due to that?    No, of course not. And that's why motherboard manufactures cheap out so much, especially on AM5 boards.

What you get in the desktop was paid for by the console manufacturers and it is as powerful and feature-packed as the console manufacturers were willing to pay.   What I mean is, AMD's strategy with RT was meant to be cheap because it's the way Sony and MS got to have the tech while also not having spiraling hardware costs. Rdna2 is basically the tech those consoles got scaled up and rDNA 3 was rdna 2+.   Rdna4 was basically a rehash of what Sony paid for the ps5 pro. And rdna5 is likely going to be a beef up version of whatever the console manufacturers pay for the 2027 season.    AMD doesn't have anywhere near the r&d money nvidia has and it doesn't have the deep pockets Intel has to throw money to a hard problem until they crack it.   I'm going to be the first to complain about their lack of software strategy, but their hardware strategy makes sense when you consider they get a tenth of the market share nvidia gets and for the longest time had revenue much smaller than Intel's and Nvidia's. They make the best use of the tech MS and Sony pay for their consoles.    Maybe this time they will use that sweet sweet AI money to flesh out their hardware, but I'm not holding my breath.

AMD,o437sd5,"Native is not a magic resolution where everything is correct. This is a statement people keep making that sounds correct if you don't think about it, but it's just flatly wrong.      Tons of geometry and textures have detail that can be smaller than a pixel in games today. The vast majority of effects and basically all the lighting (whether ray traced or not) is initially rendered at lower than native resolution.  TAA is already used in basically every game because of how common deferred rendering is. If TAA weren't used, the flickering and aliasing would be so intense it would make games unplayably bad.    Even if none of that were true, the idea of native being ""correct"" makes no sense. We would have had no need then for antialiasing techniques like SSAA or MSAA.    DLSS and all upscaling techniques today are a form of super sampling. It's just that they trade off spatial resolution and do the super sampling temporally. Using data from past frames is obviously worse than just rendering at a higher resolution in a vacuum. But you need cheap anti aliasing that covers everything anyway. And basically every game needs temporal accumulation (to run effects at sub-native resolution) in order to run fast enough with good enough visual quality anyway. And if you really can create an algorithm that effectively reuses data from past frames, then it can both look better and run faster than native.    Now could there be edge cases where something looks worse? Sure. All you need to do is look at FSR2/3 to see how worse algorithms make a ton more tradeoffs. But with good techniques, there will also be many situations where it can look better.    And if you truly care about quality above all else, then you can turn up graphical settings when introducing some upscaling. You'd have to compare something like ""Native"" with Low settings to DLSS with Medium or High settings (turning up the most impactful graphical settings until the framerate was the same).    Personally, at 4K output,  DLSS is always worth turning on.

AMD,o43gs9y,"In 2020, during the RTX 3000 series launch, Nvidia tried to control HU's videos because HU ""did not focus enough"" on DLSS. I believe it was either by refusing to send FE cards, or directly by telling them what to write? Not sure anymore, but after a public outcry and support from LTT, GN, and other outlets, Nvidia reversed their course.  Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Only around the Radeon RX 9000 series release did HU balance their coverage. I believe this was because both companies, AMD and Nvidia, had done so much anti-consumer shit by that point, that the public hated them (almost) equally.  Before this launch, the Reddit majority opinion was ""AMD has shittier drivers, but GPUs are much better value, and we can handle worse FSR for the price difference, also they are much better for Linux and fuck Nvidia for many valid reasons"". After the launch, Nvidia invested into Linux drivers (but had Windows driver issues of their own), AMD did the same shit with pricing, and DLSS pulled away far enough from FSR that the difference became too difficult to ignore. Both companies now have done so much anti-consumer shit in one way or another that they are evenly disliked, imo.",hardware,2026-02-07 15:47:31,10,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99851924), 'word': 'R', 'start': 20, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9385893), 'word': '##TX 3000', 'start': 21, 'end': 28}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8916375), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 44, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.68197536), 'word': 'H', 'start': 68, 'end': 69}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7780968), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 117, 'end': 121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9426508), 'word': 'LTT', 'start': 281, 'end': 284}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98225677), 'word': 'GN', 'start': 286, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96705884), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 309, 'end': 315}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.73101), 'word': 'HU', 'start': 353, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.85297865), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 461, 'end': 467}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.48972327), 'word': '##SR', 'start': 598, 'end': 600}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78182423), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 797, 'end': 800}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.85710466), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 804, 'end': 808}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.831324), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 842, 'end': 846}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8129512), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 894, 'end': 897}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98164797), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 945, 'end': 948}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9081401), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 967, 'end': 971}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.54764897), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1001, 'end': 1003}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9519898), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1011, 'end': 1014}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8305371), 'word': 'pro', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1105}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4920082), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1106, 'end': 1108}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.73303086), 'word': '##D', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8826575), 'word': 'Radeon RX 9000', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1147}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952859), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1237, 'end': 1240}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98249274), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1245, 'end': 1251}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.79828703), 'word': 'Reddit', 'start': 1374, 'end': 1380}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88836074), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1403, 'end': 1406}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8291483), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 1485, 'end': 1488}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5177643), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1545, 'end': 1550}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8377414), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1560, 'end': 1566}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.44177604), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1654, 'end': 1661}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.57036996), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1731, 'end': 1733}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5451503), 'word': '##SR', 'start': 1765, 'end': 1767}]",Tópico 4

AMD,o44mb2y,"> Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  I mean that's a fair attitude no? People might disagree with it, but that's not evidence of bias, it's just an opinion on the value of RT. RT has only really come into fruition in the last few years, before then it was a reflective puddle that halved the frame rate or something. Not focussing lots of benchmarking RT for the perhaps 5 games where it is worth it does make sense.  >Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Since DLSS 2 (1 was awful), they've always said DLSS was better than FSR. At times FSR wasn't that far behind DLSS, and when AMD cards were a fair bit cheaper it might be been worth it for some.

You click and app is open and ready to go + feeling of mouse how smooth suddenly become! Even likes of Steam opening visible quicker!    But having 9800x3D gives you uplift because of extra 64mb cache and this cache too exchanging data with memory so when your extra cache can exchange data faster you get more performance all for free!!

Part of that might be corporate culture, part of it might just be that Nvidia's 90% of the gaming market, part of it is just gaming adapting to the hardware the market provides (if you're a AAA game dev now or developing any sort of technically ambitious feature, you are building your engine/game from the ground up with features like RT/PT/DLSS/Framegen/NRC whatever else from the ground up- future cards are going to have insane matrix math capabilities to support AI, so we take our current gaming computation problems and turn them into matrix math problems- that's just the general hardware market shaping gaming tech).

AMD,o4gb8f3,"The whole ""NVIDIA doesn't care about gaming"" idea has always been absolute bullshit. Obviously no massive corporation ""cares"" in the way we humans might care about something, that is a given. But the idea that NV is somehow *uniquely disdainful* of gamers is childish and facile, and has no basis in observable fact.   If anything, it's the opposite: as someone who has been a PC gaming enthusiast for decades, I think NV has actually done more for me in that position than any other company (except, perhaps, Valve). Obviously they do so for business reasons; but the way they decide to act has been frequently beneficial to PC gaming.  As one massive (for me) example, I remember the first post-CRT decade in the monitor market where 60 Hz was just seen as **the** standard, and that was basically it. Which was very bleak from an action gaming perspective. And what really started to change that whole trajectory was the introduction of G-Sync -- not so much just the technology itself but more so getting the whole stagnant monitor industry to see the value of creating gaming-focused products.",hardware,2026-02-09 16:09:35,42,Neutral,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95250416), 'word': 'N', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.30452913), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 12, 'end': 14}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82772505), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 14, 'end': 17}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.65599316), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9526798), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 377, 'end': 379}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69412696), 'word': 'NV', 'start': 419, 'end': 421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9907094), 'word': 'Valve', 'start': 510, 'end': 515}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9501052), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 626, 'end': 628}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97783375), 'word': 'G', 'start': 940, 'end': 941}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9762014), 'word': 'S', 'start': 942, 'end': 943}]",Tópico 1

High performing matrix cores were probably a requirement for a high quality temporal upscaler and RT denoiser as well.

So, intead of trees with leaves and branches, you got this clumpy malformation of trees with a bunch of green colors that were supposed to be leaves that looked like something from 10 years prior. The upscaler also wasn't great as Nvidia was trying to make the tensor cores do too many things at once.  DLSS2 was where Nvidia turned the corner. That actually started with shader-based DLSS 1.9 that debuted in Control. This moved to a generalized training algorithm based on temporal multi-frame accumulation (TAA-based). Image softness and ghosting were still issues though, so AMD's contrast adaptive sharpening often provided better results when combined with a basic upscaler.  DLSS3/4/4.5 continued improving upscaler algorithms and models to where we are today. It took years to get to this point because missing pixel information was an issue when upscaling images.

To be fair to Nvidia, the segmentation wasn't necessarily ""needless"" once you know the history and origin of G-Sync.

Neither of these features existed in mainline DisplayPort at the time VESA had no intention of doing so.  It took nearly **2 years** after G-Sync was announced for VESA to announce their implementation into the DP1.2a spec and still more time after that because the LFC logic had to be built into the GPU (1st Gen G-Sync actually had LFC built-in to the custom ARM SBC they were using as the Display Controller+TCON).

For example a lot of them had a really, really narrow update frequency where VRR actually worked. With G-Sync it did not matter what your refresh was, it would also be VRR and smooth. It accomplished this by various techniques like doubling frames at the really low refresh rates.   With a lot of the early FreeSync monitors, we had monitors that would only enable VRR at specific update frequencies, like maybe 48-75 Hz and as soon as you had higher or lower FPS than that, VRR would get disabled.

Which was last generations  ryzen 9 . 12 cores 24 threads.  But not a 3d chip . It boosted to very high speeds 4.8 - 5.6ghz . And used 175w of max power .  Now I am using a 9800X3D which Is a ryzen 7 . So on paper you'd think I traded for a lower performance CPU.   But , they key to this is . I cores is an amd cpu chiplet. Anything more and they have to solder another chiplet to it . And add the remaining cores.  Then bridge the chips .to make it one .  So in gaming . A game uses what 4 to 7 cores usually.  And a GPU for heavy lifting with lots and lots of little changes .  The 8 cores is the 12 cores recieves the power and distributes it evenly amongst a more powerful core in the 3D chips . This being the abundance of cache thr 3D has. High speed data transfer like ram for your  CPU chip..   It works gaming better gaming in 8 cores with 3D cache.  This has been studied and known for a while . At least to generations.  The 7800X3D was commonly known to be a tiny bit faster in gaming than my same generation . Series 7900X . The  7800X3D only boosted to 4.8ghz.mine boosted to 5.6ghz . And had 4 more cores . But in actuality I had two 6 cores CPUs soldered together . Then bridged. The X variant is wonderful actually for both gaming and regular PC work .   But if your talking gaming PC. The X3D chips are made to game . Tailored to it . The most recent generation even can be overclocked like an Intel chip . And also moved the cache to the underside of the chip I believe to make the high speed data transfer distance shorter and cooler . Not 100% .   I suggest the 7800X3D 9800X3D or 9850X3D if just for gaming . While thr 9950X3D is their top of line twin 8 core CPU making it full 16 cores . Essentially two 9800X3D's of power for both gaming and work that requires multi core performance.    Hope I educated you a tiny bit more. And figure out your purchase needs .

That sips power like a newborn trying moonshine. Hardly using may power at all 120watts . 5.5 ghz top speed boost matching my 7900x 5.5 ghz across 12 cores at 165watts.   And it still benches higher then the 9 series of last gen too . They are just built well . Built smart . And sometimes yes less complicated produces better results .my 7 series 9800X3D does not bottleneck on a 5090 . So your 9070XT  . Im thinking the 5900X3D for you will work like a charm .

AMD,o7ledil,"It's sort of an inherent trouble coupled with modern game design and a little bit of scheduling weirdness. Basically, a lot of current gen games want 8 cores and 8-16 threads, which tends to leave the 6+6 getting a little funky as if Core 0 wants something from Core 7 it has to get it across the infinity fabric. With the X3D, it actually ends up being the reverse case, where the first 6 cores have all of the cache (by a lot!) and so the other 2-6 need to go ask politely for data.  The 7600X you currently have is most likely suffering from this to some extent as well, in that a lot of games could really use the 2 cores it's missing; still faster than the console setup, but the highest framerate target on the consoles is 120... Which more or less tracks with you running out of CPU around 130, actually.   Glancing at Newegg, seeing that you're currently on a fairly limited GPU, I'd probably lean toward the 9800X3D and pizza for dinner.

Those CPUs are essentially made of 2 sets of cpu cores (called ccd's) that communicate with each other through interfaces (AMD brand it as infinity fabric).  Intercore communication within a ccd is about 10-20 ns. Inter-ccd communication is about 100-200 ns. You get the idea. With high thread workloads where latency doesn't matter, you get lots of threads and cores. In gaming where latency does matter, communication across the cores gets bottlenecked by the interface and you get frame drops. That's why AMD drivers and Windows will disable half of the cores to avoid frame drops when you play a game.  That's why if you focus on gaming, you always get single ccd chips like the 7800x3d or 9800x3d.   If you want to game and work which is what your build is planning to do, then get a 9950x3d.

AMD,o7lkyak,The 7600x Should have been a massive upgrade over the I-5 8700K overclocked to 5GZ I was running before but for productivity I think the old I5 was faster and for gaming the 7600 is faster but also way less stable.   Switching to AM5 I threw most of my money at RAM (Good thing too because I beat the price hikes) and got a really good deal with for the mobo and 7600 but It's not the improvement I was expecting considering how much time there is between the I5 8700k and the 7600.  Also wasn't really expecting to get back into PC gaming or I probably would have sprung for an X3D model and probably would have been fine.

I'll probably wind up with the 9850 but I'm curious if anybody knows why The 9850 isn't consistently a little better and why in some games the 9800 scorches it instead of it almost always being 50/50 with the 9850 occasionally being better instead of equal.   I haven't said anything to confirm but it almost seems like the 9850 distributed work more effectively but maybe there are some games that are harder on the first six or seven cores and the 9800 runs better when the workload isn't even.  If that's the case the 9800 would be the better gaming CPU and The 9850 would be my choice hands down since My CAD program It's pretty good about slamming all the cores evenly.   My 7600 is weird especially on productivity stuff. I don't really know how to monitor it close enough to tell but it almost feels like sometimes something goes wrong and it doesn't actually engage all of its cores. I can send something to slice and it'll take 3 minutes and I'll Go back to double check something and send the same exact thing to slice again without editing and it'll take like six or seven minutes the second time. It's just super inconsistent and while yes it is slower than I'd like for gaming it's like sometimes when I'm at 1080p for the CPU just skips. Nothing normal hitching I get out of a GPU that's running out of VRAM but like the CPU thermal throttles for a split second.

AMD,o7c9xa9,">\- shouldnt the new computer be many times faster, to be able to perfom better then the old one?  That hasn't been true for quite a while because even though the technology has improved we really don't need all that performance.  It's kinda like the megapixels in digital cameras.  In the early days every additional megapixel added to the sensor made a huge difference in quality.  But once we started going beyond 6 megapixels (don't quote me on the exact number) the image quality did not have as much of an impact.  The difference between a 50 and 100 megapixel camera is only beneficial to applications that can take advantage of it.  Just like a computer with 24 cores on the processor are mostly useless until you run an application that can take advantage of all 24 cores at the same time.  >\- wondering, does a descrete graphics make such a huge impact in a pc perfomance?  Similar answer as above as you need an application like a game to truly see the impact.  Otherwise merely browsing the web, checking email, and watching Youtube ain't gonna make a difference even if it's a discrete vs integrated GPU.  There are many reasons why your newer system could have felt slower than your older system, but have you ever compared the time it takes to convert between the two systems on the same OS?  For all you know the conversion time on the newer system might be faster than the old but you have to run them both on the same OS and do your time comparisons.  It could be the way the software is configured on the old system that allows it to take advantage of hardware acceleration while the new system isn't set up properly.  Also your old system got to use those drives while they were young and fresh while the new system has to use the same drives while they're being grandpas.  You are trying to compare a server processor to a desktop processor and servers do excel at multiple I/Os.

A tech bubble popping doesn't always mean the emergent tech goes away, it means the majority of companies that had no reason to be invested in go bankrupt and close their doors.  Right now we have over 40 billion dollar companies doing their own flavor of AI agents and chatbots, yet we only hear about maybe 6 of them.  Majority of these companies make no profit.   When that bubble bursts majority of those companies will close their doors.  This doesn't mean AI itself goes away, this just means a huge chunk of money invested in the tech sector gets pulled out (E.g.; Bubble Bursts) and stock prices will go tanking largely affecting the tech sector.  And you will likely see only a few companies come out unscathed.   It'll be about who actually has a viable product that actually does what they advertise.  And thus far the studies aren't looking great.  Also consider that AI has been actively worked on since 1959 in various forms and it finally got to this point.

It was a little more costly, but also had a decently better reconstruction to make up for it and more. And FSR3/2 in Cyberpunk always sucked for quality.  BUT again, you at least are ripping files from 2023 into the drivers or outright using 2023 drivers which will mean fixes done afterwards will be gone, and one big one for me is Forza Horizon 3 actually got fixed last year with a terrible visual glitching issue that it had since 2022 drivers was fixed.

Good for Steam Deck tho is that Linux drivers do work with FSR4 INT8 already, RDNA3 can even emulate the FP8 version on Linux. But if a tiny Steam Deck GPU can run FSR4... the entire RDNA2 stack can, it's just AMD for some reason sitting on the code their devs made and saying ""nah."", likely to try to push RX 9000 sales instead of having RDNA2/3 owners wait until future GPUs on newer nodes that will be faster, better fps per watt and have better features than RDNA4 and so also last longer until they get upgraded again.",AMD,2026-02-27 10:26:56,6,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70080066), 'word': 'R', 'start': 10, 'end': 11}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9283284), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 30, 'end': 33}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9719187), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 51, 'end': 58}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67764115), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 208, 'end': 210}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9666334), 'word': 'D', 'start': 313, 'end': 314}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50660026), 'word': 'Cy', 'start': 387, 'end': 389}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5774425), 'word': '##punk', 'start': 392, 'end': 396}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82543516), 'word': 'Cy', 'start': 588, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7191614), 'word': '##pu', 'start': 593, 'end': 595}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4029917), 'word': '##nk', 'start': 595, 'end': 597}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85749805), 'word': 'Forza Horizon 3', 'start': 804, 'end': 819}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9845062), 'word': 'Steam Deck', 'start': 1059, 'end': 1069}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66655886), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1082, 'end': 1087}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9260782), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1128, 'end': 1129}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5637816), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 1130, 'end': 1132}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47077796), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1170, 'end': 1175}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9902966), 'word': 'Steam Deck', 'start': 1191, 'end': 1201}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6005439), 'word': '##U', 'start': 1204, 'end': 1205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.37378517), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1233, 'end': 1234}]",Tópico 4

AMD,o7mvaso,"When the RTX 2000 series came out people were so upset that nvidia basically cut feature support going forward for all previous generations but they had to do it to get where they are today. RDNA 4 is the first generation of AMD GPUs that actually have the correct hardware to not have a sub-par modern machine learning based software experience. So, if AMD cuts it off at RDNA 4 but keeps whatever they're working on backwards compatible from the 9000 series and forwards I think that would actually better for them and for all current 9000 series and future owners of AMD GPUs. They have to cut it off somewhere and RDNA 3 just doesn't have the necessary hardware for a good experience with everything they are working on. I know it sucks but I think it might be a good choice for AMD to support RDNA 4 as the oldest generation of hardware that has total support of their machine learning software going forwards. I think it would just detract from the quality of current and future endeavours if they tried to include support for RDNA 3. I know that sucks to hear but it just might be what they need to do in order to really make it work going forwards.  Also, looking at nvidia there's no FG for the 20 and 30 series and no MFG for the 40 series and who knows what there won't be for the 50 series in like 2028 or 2029 when it finally comes out. Hardware is massively changing and while it is we are just going to have generations lacking the proper hardware to support certain features well. I am sure there will be a time when the current hardware change will settle in and then there will be gen upon gen that support all the same features. We just got too used to the hardware landscape not changing other than things getting faster for too long that we forgot what it is like when you have true hardware innovation over a few generations.

AMD's GTX equivalent tier is RDNA1, while half assed vs RTX GeForce, RDNA2 did add the essential feature support needed. RDNA4 merely upgraded to FP8 and copes better with RT. Now yeah Redstone not working on older GPUs could make sense, but the upscaling does work and Nvidia provides it to even a RTX 2060 from 2018.  And honestly frame gen is nowhere close to the importance of upscaling models which also offer better temporal AA solutions at native res vs TAA.

Mobile iGPUs aren't going to be fast enough for heavy ray tracing games even if they included the RT hardware, and obviously clocks are limited on mobile platforms for power use reasons.

AMD,o6oqp31,"I want to see what AMD have done with the interconnect. Of course, Strix Halo was a preview, but CCDs still need parallel operations with that package. I really want to see the CCDs and overall architecture act in a more cohesive way. CCDs make sense for server/datacenter, since those operations are exceedingly parallel, almost to a fault.  Gaming, not so much. There are thread spawns with dependencies that can't be on a different CCD currently.  AMD may have to move to grouped CCDs where two to four form a Super Compute Cluster (SCC). These can be tightly linked dies that can communicate and act as one previous CCD. To link them, they simply need to be rotated to where the edge communication connect is (two sides for server or one side for consumer). It can be decently high bandwidth, matching at least local L3 bandwidth. The great thing here is that this also works for server/datacenter operations, but the real winner is us: consumers. Of course, SCCs can accept V-Cache underneath with clever routing.  The cluster can then accept thread spawns with dependencies across any core with the only cost being latency on farthest cores (some firmware and thread schedulers can handle that). A hardware thread scheduler would be nice, but only necessary for mixed core or hybrid silicon. So, if we have 2x standard 12-core CCDs in a single SCC, it'd operate like a large, unified 24-core CPU.

Lets say 90% of an app's work will multithread perfectly. That is, if you run it on an 8 core machine, that work'll be 8x as fast as on a 1 core machine.

I won't be surprised if the 24 core chip ends up costing 1200 to 1400 Canadian. By comparison the ryzen 9950x3d costs 950. I think with zen6 AMD is manufacturing both an 8 core and a 12 core CCD. There is no way the 6 core and 8 core parts are cut down 12 cores. Fortunately those massive core chips are practically useless and unnecessary since using that many cores is very difficult. We only need the entry level 6 core chips because those bring massive single threaded performance. The 12 core x3d chip is going to be very nice as well.

They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,nxvyiba,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.

Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable?

Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability.
