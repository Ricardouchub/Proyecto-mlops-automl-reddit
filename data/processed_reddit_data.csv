Intel,n1sr0i1,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",hardware,2025-07-04 02:03:25,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90186936, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 214, 'end': 217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86568034, 'word': 'N', 'start': 863, 'end': 864}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.62983924, 'word': 'Pascal', 'start': 888, 'end': 894}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5193365, 'word': 'Titan', 'start': 1013, 'end': 1018}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7143878, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1344, 'end': 1350}]",Tópico 4

You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support).

Intel,mt4vsoz,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,10,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87045366, 'word': 'A', 'start': 9, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8757272, 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 492, 'end': 501}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4702369, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 580, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9827648, 'word': 'LL', 'start': 666, 'end': 668}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.75775045, 'word': 'Flash Attention', 'start': 892, 'end': 907}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99654156, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 911, 'end': 916}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9984048, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7069878, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1250, 'end': 1251}]",Tópico 4

Intel,n94duvw,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch.

Reason being that with your setup, once you start moving up in GPU, you’re not gonna see as big of a performance uplift because of your 5700x, which will start to slightly but noticeably bottleneck a 9070/5070 or above  Which if you did go with a 9070/5070, say you get one for $600, you’d need a new PSU, which is around $70-$100. And at that point, it’s not worth paying $300 extra for a 25-30% performance uplift at 1440p because thats a 50-60% price increase.  You could upgrade your CPU sure, but then at that point, with a new CPU/RAM/MOBO/GPU and Power Supply, that’s basically just building a whole new PC, and you’re not gonna be able to do that for under $800, nor should you because again, the price increase isn’t worth the performance increase.  If I were in your shoes, I’d get the 9060xt 16gb and ride out the rest of my PC for 4-5 more years playing at 1440p. After that, if Im unsatisfied with the performance and frames im getting in games, I’d sell it/keep it as a spare and start from scratch a brand new build ground up.

You're also looking at more CPU overhead, so if you have a weaker CPU it might not be the best idea.   I also don't know how much I'd trust Intel with long term driver support for the a750. Their GPU division is on shaky legs and given that arc alchemist was never that popular I wouldn't wager a lot on them spending a lot of resources on long term support    On the flip side you get much better ray tracing performance with the a750 (although not really relevant for either card in this performance tier imo), a vastly superior upscaler (xess runs on AMD cards but looks and performs considerably worse than natively on Intel) and a bit more rasterized performance.

You can always free up your Windows install and remove bloat. Minimum for Win 11 is like 2-4 GB base RAM usage, so you should have enough left for gaming. Really only becomes an issue when you do stuff like open Chrome with dozens of active tabs and have like 12GB base RAM usage before even opening the game.  140€ is just a horrible price for outdated RAM. I got my 32GB kit (which is running at 3600/16 right now) for \~110€ 6 years ago.  >The 5800X3D is a beast and doesn't fall far behind the newer flagship AMD CPU's, so I'm very comfortable staying on AM4.  Well, 5800X3D is around 7600X performance in most games. Maybe slightly better whenever the 3D-cache matters. Usually, you get \~10% per gen, but just the one gen step to the 7800X3D is already 20% faster.  There certainly is no big reason to upgrade right now, but it also makes no sense to get new DDR4 RAM. Realistically, you could just sell RAM+MoBo+CPU and get like 300-400€ for it. Which you can then use to get an AM5 system with a 9600X or so. You might even be able to get a 7800X3D system if we include those 140€ that you would be willing to spend on new RAM.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,23,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96047413, 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97551155, 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.47393385, 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9978709, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9221623, 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9936434, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.70016813, 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.99374455, 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97952205, 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.996042, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9800243, 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9670311, 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9871013, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9752412, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9922133, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6682615, 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99653184, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86584127, 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.64568275, 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90114915, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87513644, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8040758, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7500115, 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8380654, 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8164692, 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.88147104, 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9793236, 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9005273, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.69748294, 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.58866495, 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.511351, 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99225956, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.80401796, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7076516, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88741785, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5076931, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7363588, 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9888704, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99029034, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,66,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.98579425, 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6807291, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.53338933, 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8288868, 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8976541, 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87239146, 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87449735, 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.52110374, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.63087755, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9507805, 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5053189, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8337852, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69437224, 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5678201, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6214103, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6280626, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 4

Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..

Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.

How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  My aging 5700 XT crashes in games far less often than my friends who are on various Nvidia cards from 2080 Ti to 4090.  Same for when I was on Polarix with RX 470s.  Game crashes are rarely the fault of the graphics driver (or hardware), regardless of brand.  This isn't a good point to be making, because it's just wrong.  > suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality  This again?  No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7806482, 'word': 'N', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.49206084, 'word': '##vid', 'start': 290, 'end': 293}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.59018177, 'word': 'T', 'start': 312, 'end': 313}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8755103, 'word': 'Polarix', 'start': 348, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96025205, 'word': 'R', 'start': 361, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7545489, 'word': 'PSP', 'start': 567, 'end': 570}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4970201, 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 631, 'end': 633}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.4853362, 'word': '##on VII', 'start': 635, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.808714, 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 652, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.85674083, 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 900, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7854365, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.66929066, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8934808, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1491, 'end': 1494}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96433926, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1627, 'end': 1630}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.80651146, 'word': 'George', 'start': 1813, 'end': 1819}]",Tópico 2

It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.949649, 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91378605, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7303601, 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975333, 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84053415, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6853485, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 4

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9452912, 'word': 'Lenovo', 'start': 223, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8261307, 'word': 'Hogwartz', 'start': 805, 'end': 813}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9086967, 'word': 'Rachet', 'start': 815, 'end': 821}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6654186, 'word': 'Clank', 'start': 826, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.72740483, 'word': 'Re', 'start': 833, 'end': 835}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8370989, 'word': '2', 'start': 841, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9770279, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1467}]",Tópico 4

Intel,n0yywsv,"Different strategies. X3D has its place in time. X3D chips have to have another separate line to build and now test. No mobile X3D chips so far.   Silicon cost is greatly lowered if the design is the same and desktop/mobile chips can be binned to create separate product lines.    AMD I will argue absolutely needed to produce stellar products because of their past history before Zen 1. No one will defend AMD products before Zen 1.   I will definitely use a newer better AMD chip today but back then he'll no. There GPU line has driver issues and its why all of us just use NVIDIA gpus. There is a good reason.    Intel's new chip design strategy and leading edge fab is solid. The problem is foundry capital expenditure and foundry capacity. They have to build excess and train excess personal. The Ohio Silicon Heart Land. A whole new campus, town, new families, and Silicon ecosystem.    That takes time and a ton of money. And investment (aka the money levers) just dont want to pay for this. They rather get there money's worth of AI and self driving vehicles today. They know Chinese EV investment is bad and Chinese AI is bad. So rather than invest in Chinese companies and not make money, they want to use there leverage to pump up American companies.    This way American companies like Tesla and AI will succeed and win this AI race.   In other words, China ain't in the leading edge foundry game. None at all. No chance. So why pump money into that? They instead are attacking the EV and AI race. So our American companies will need capital to defend that space.   Intel design products are absolutely solid. 1000% they maintain better MT performance without SMT. SMT has security vulnerability.    Intel products are wafer Silicon efficient with p and E cores. Intel design is solid. Just foundry is extremely expensive and there isnt a China competitor. Taiwan is a very safe island.   If Taiwan was like a Hawaii, easily conquered, then for sure TSMC is at risk. But Taiwan today is like an island carrier/fortress. Too difficult to go against.

Intel,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7863968, 'word': 'RMA', 'start': 4, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99725705, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 20, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9996716, 'word': 'Germany', 'start': 140, 'end': 147}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7773049, 'word': 'RMA', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9982186, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 518, 'end': 523}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.86127424, 'word': 'R', 'start': 739, 'end': 740}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.997638, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1079, 'end': 1084}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99489284, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1920, 'end': 1925}]",Tópico 4

Intel,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.

That's a huge clock speed deficit compared to the 5800XT and 5800X3D. When the 5800X3D first came out, it spanked the 5800X even though it was clocked 200MHz lower all-core (4500MHz vs 4300MHz).  But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D part is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a much larger difference than 5800X3D vs. 5800X. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron.

That only makes sense if we pretend Nvidia doesn't already have aggressive compression, which they’ve had for years. Historically, Nvidia's compression has been better than AMD's as well.  A ""\~25% fabric traffic reduction"" in gaming tests isn't a free +25% to external bandwidth, and it doesn't erase a \~40% raw GB/s gap. Even if we assume AMD just matched or let's even go as far as to say \~10% better than Nvidia's compression, they'd still be well behind on effective bandwidth.  The simpler explanation for those results is that the tested scenarios aren't that bandwidth-bound.

AMD,naxro34,"Kepler\_L2 said L0 and L1 is merged in CDNA4. Maybe RDNA 5 goes even further and merges all CU level caches (including VRF) into one big shared flexible cache like Apple did with M3 and A17 Pro.   Like you said it's about SRAM scaling being bad and minimizing SRAM investment. N3P = no scaling, N5 poor scaling vs N7.      NVIDIA definitely has the advantage here while AMD's cache system is overly complicated and inflexible. The next logical step is to make caches into one big shared block that can be dynamically allocated for different purposes.   L1 will be much more important with the new WGS and ADC scheduling and dispatch within each SE. No more global scheduling only work item preparation and load balancing. This and other methods could explain why L2 will be less important and less used allowing AMD to use 24MB L2 on AT2 (According to MLID and Kepler\_L2 rumours).   Actually the rumour for AT2 is +25% CUs and -25% PHY width vs 9070XT, so perhaps AMD has some novel and forward looking memory saving technology in UDNA. AT2 on paper could easily be stronger than 4090 in raster and that's wild with 24MB L2 and such a weak memory subsystem.

AMD,nb4xvl0,"Agree with u/Strazdas1 RDNA4 was about adressing a ton of issues in RDNA3 + AMD GCN baggage and obvious issues that needed to be fixed.  Meanwhile RDNA5 will literally change everything. Complete clean slate moment. You're comparing a Terascale -> GCN moment with a major architectural tweak, albeit still no more than a tweak.  NVIDIA has had OoO memory since Turing. WGPR is really cool but AMD wasn't the first to introduce it. Apple has had it since 2023. OBB is nice and actually an AMD first for once but I suspect this is really Cerny's doing more than anything. WMMA is just catching up to NVIDIA 40 series ML HW 2.5 years later.  RDNA4 had a small relatively IPC increase. I did the math months ago. Think it was around 6-8% but not sure. Only exception is 7600 -> 9060XT but that card used RDNA 2 WGP data stores and not the beefed up RDNA 3 stores.  AMD held it back because they wanted to see what NVIDIA priced the cards at, then they didn't invest enough in the driver team + had absurdly low stock at launch so they had to delay the launch.  AMD has not been serious about competiting against NVIDIA since IDK when. where's the prebuilt SIs and OEM contracts? 8% total market share what a joke, if you look at prebuilt vs DIY then it's not good for AMD.

will have to sell bigger dies that compete with smaller AMD and Nvidia counterparts in 2027 (likely sharing GPU silicon dies with Nova Lake-A and AX)   If they do release a Celestial DGPU then it will likely only be 1 or 2 SKU's that compete on price and are ready in 2027  It will likely be very quickly replaced with Xe4 Druid DGPU's in 2028 which should look more like a proper    AMD/Nvidia  GPU

AMD,nab1e1g,"If we all want vanilla, the same flavor, the same performance, then forcing board makers to adhere to AMD's recommendations is fine.  Many enthusiasts are building pcs to tinker with them, to make adjustments to make them a little better a little different.  This is why we have options in bios to make changes.The ""p"" in pc stands for personal, we want to make it ours.  Manufacturers understand this and create products to sell into the enthusiast market to meet this need.  The manufacturers need to be mindful of the risks they take and not go to the extreme of torching cpus and mobos (a la Intel).  The manufacturers are trying to balance performance vs longevity.  In general they do a good job.  The problems with Asrock boards effected a small percentage of boards.  A significant number of boards were impacted to be sure, but still a small percentage.  The estimates I've seen are perhaps 1 to 2%.  Had it been as widespread as some think, 50%+, Asrock would have had to pull their boards immediately because that high a failure rate is unsustainable financially AND it will destroy the brand's credibility.    It is helpful to keep perspective on the magnitude of the problem and why the manufacturers are enticed to take risks.  The board makers are appealing to builders who are looking for competitive advantages.  Sometimes, the engineers fly a little too close to the sun.  This is similar to the problem Nvidia has with the 12vhpwr connectors.   There is no doubt there is a problem, yet the vast majority of 5090 cards run fine with no melting cables.  Most people with Asrock or other boards suffered no failures.  If you were someone whose board/cpu failed, it was a major problem and unacceptable.  I get that.  It is important to keep perspective.  I encourage the designers, engineers, manufacturers to push the envelope to wrest better and better performance from their designs and products.  When they do this we all benefit.  Amd occasionally, mistakes are made.  The test is how people and companies respond to the mistakes.  Will we own our mistakes, make amends, learn from the mistakes and move forward?  Or do we want to prosecute and persecute those that made the mistake?  If companies like Asrock were more forthcoming in publicly owning the mistake, then it might diffuse things.

Different minimum voltages needed for different memory vendors and specs of the kit, not just the memory voltage but the VSOC voltage for the memory controller on the CPU. A lot of the AMD cpu failures were from mobo makers juicing the VSOC too high to guarantee the memory is stable.  It’s possible to enforce it but a lot of effort needs to go into testing and verifying minimum voltages needed needed on every single board and every single memory kit. And it leads to more product RMAs when just a tiny bit more voltage is needed to make a certain kit stable but the board isn’t giving it. IMO they should be making the effort though. Could cause increased costs but that’s better than ruining reputation frying chips and getting all that bad press.  Not saying the current situation with the mobo vendors is OK, they seem pretty lazy about setting too high voltages, especially for VSOC, when XMP is on, and just calling it fine and shipping it.

A lot of chip(let) to chip(let) communication is already covered by ECC or at least EDC, and error counters are commonly available, they are just not properly (especially not uniformly) exposed.  For example on modern AMD CPUs, increasing FCLK too high can result in experiencing stuttering, making it highly likely that the IFOP is protected by some EDC. EDC error counters being exposed to users could be helpful with treating errors before they turn into crashing, and they could be also useful for faster and more reliable stability tests.  Then there's that whole ECC memory issue of reliable memory not considered being important for regular users.

Can't even do a lot of tasks on a PC anymore because a lot of services are phone-only, and then it turns out that the phone crapp isn't willing to run on a non-stock OS.

We had a golden age of computing where people could (and had to) learn quite a bit about technology to get to their goals, and many people could do so with having to learn English first. Nowadays people are funneled towards entertainment/consuming with just a few clicks/taps, and even if anything goes wrong, the technical details are often hidden, only presenting a ""Something went wrong"" or ""Oopsie woopsie"" page.

He should be able to net min $200\~ in the next few years when he wants to upgrade.  Power draw in most games is actually within 40W of each other when left stock... Only outlier is likely battlefield where the game will leverage a full CPU and draw like 150W max.. but it's really only this game engine.  I'll go against the grain a little.. I don't think this CPU runs hot.. at least relative to the 8+8 alder/raptor configs.. which tend to hit 100C pretty easily.  Edit: just realized hes in Europe.

I have used AMD for the last 5 years, but there is a certain price where getting 5 years on a 14600k is worth it. $100 after selling BF6 is pretty damn close to that price!   I also love how everyone parrots ""spend more - who cares how much, because you can upgrade on the same socket and save a few dollars!"" Like bro, save the money up front instead, get a great performer now, and just upgrade when you need it. It comes out to similar cost in the end, since everything will be cheaper (ie cost / frame) in 5 years. If you need to upgrade sooner than that, you probably made compromises in your initial CPU choice, or you are an enthusiast and wouldn't be making this post.    As I prepare for the downvotes, I will add I feel good about 14600k, but not 14700k or higher.

Just try to get 12gb of VRAM if possible, as what is going to hit you first and foremost is the 8gb VRAM limit issues which is a right-now current event.  However, if that price is too much for you to swing (or the price of any 12gb cards), then 8gb will have to do.  If you are targeting 1080p resolution, or 1440p on games older than a year or two (or three), you should be OK at somewhere in the neighborhood of medium to high settings, which you can lower if things get too choppy.  If it is REALLY slow, just knock texture detail down to medium first, as this helps 8gb cards a lot, and keep those ray tracing settings down to low or off.  Get a 9060 or better if you want to even try RT effects on AMD cards to any decent amount.  8gb VRAM cards will be fine for most e-sports games or Minecraft/Roblox/Kids games, though, if that's it's intended use-case.

GOOD LUCK!   Amazon/Ebay do sell used stuff and it can come with warranty, there's even replacement-cost policies you can buy when you buy hardware for usually around 10% the purchase cost per part that are sold by separate insurance companies (like Allstate and others) if the given sold-as warranty is not enough.  Most failures occur in the first 90 days aside of hard drives, which tend to increase in failure rates after the first 2\~3 years depending on manufacturers.  Fans can be like this too, so get decent ones to keep the rattles at bay and keep the noise down.   Edit: Used Radeon 6800 16gb cards are getting CHEAP!

AMD,nbqi3hr,"Nothing especially wrong with Asus. They are said to have terrible warranty/support int he USA, but here in the EU (at least in hungary) they are actually probably the best in terms of warranty.  I personally have been suffering from their B550-e mobo, but that's on intel too (absolute garbage ethernet chip/driver. 2.5gbps I-225V. Had to buy a separate network card. Weirdly low publicity on the problem, apparently very niche.)  Considering you plan for longer term, I suggest trying to stretch the budget for a gpu with better cooling, especially one with PTM on the Core. Asus and MSI (and seemingly Galax, rare though) are the only nvidia partners who use PTM.  So the Asus Prime would be a great step up, both in overall cooling/noise and longevity. Won't ever have to be repaste it, which you would almost certainly have to do with a Zotac card in 5 years. Not a huge deal, but it's a peace of mind.   Don't get me wrong, the Zotac SFF is perfectly fine. But long term... if you care about noise, it's worth a bit more investment. Just a bit more though.  Or an MSI Gaming Trio, but that's probably unreasonably expensive.   So... of course it heavily depends on the price, but I would buy a card with a bit better cooler.

It's weird to say it, but based on [this video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFodA-N_SsI&t) the Gigabyte Eagle is probably a better choice than the Zotac SFF. Bit better cooling, bit better PCB.

To be clear, any of these cards will be ""fine"" if you undervolt and power limit them. But even then they won't be very quiet.  **DAMN** just checked the case's compatibility. With front fans, the max. possible GPU lenght is 306mm.   The Zotac SFF, Gigabyte Windforce SFF/Eagle and Asus Prime technically fit with 304mm lenght. That's uncomfortably close imo...  The best model that comfortably fits is the MSI Inspire, but I assume it's much more expensive. Surprisingly quiet card, despite being tiny. It has MSI's good fans.

AMD,nbrzy1s,">price/performance ratio  [Not really.](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/28.html) Retail pricing adjust fairly quickly to correct this kind of stuff. Note that the data in the linked review is using pricing data from November 2024 when it was published, so there have been some noticeable shifts.   Things are generally pretty consistent over time though. Newer, higher end chips pretty much inevitably offer substantially worse performance/$ than older/budget chips. The 9800X3D ($470) has an absolutely terrible price/performance ratio, because it's the 'top dog' and AMD can easily demand a significant premium for it - you're literally paying more than twice the $ per frame compared to something like a 9600X ($200), or even an Ultra 7 265K ($260). The 14600K can be found at $150 right now and pretty much blows everything else out of the water in terms of value.   AMD's dominance caused Intel's consumer sales to crater (in terms of CPUs sold to builders, because they're still milking tons of contracts with OEMs), so retail pricing on those parts has dropped significantly to accomodate. That $260 Ultra 7 265K launched at $395, which even then was *still* able to offer marginally better $ per frame vs the 9800X3D. At $260 it's in the same value realm as the 9600X.

AMD,nbqhcp7,"Well thank you, but it's a bit outdated, especially since Intel got a free performance boost. We talk about ram up to 8000+ MHz and free OC tuning to gain extra percentages.  But let's assume that's no real thing because we maybe talk about 5-10% extra performance.  First there is only one game, Baldurs Gate at 1080p which is better because it utilises the CPU more, but it's not really representative overall. The second strange thing: the 14900K which is actually a very powerful CPU in gaming (not as powerful as AMDs top notch CPUs, but still very strong), and pretty close to the 7800x3D falls strangely behind, if I'm not mistaken it's sometimes even better than the 7800x3D while being much more expensive obviously.  If I search for more benchmarks in more games I get very different results, also when I check videos and comparisons.  Anyway let's assume we only have this piece of information... Then we still see the ultra series in the upper midfield or top field. The ultra 9 should have way better values nowadays but the 7 is the great value CPU and it should perform comparable to the 5700x3D which is actually a very decent performance at 1080p. What's the performance uplift here, if it is CPU demanding 10-25% based on the game? Well here comes the important point, that's a big factor. I could take multiple sources, but I found actually one of gamersnexus and if you scroll through the games, you get a better view on the ranked CPUs and in many games they perform even better.  https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/intel-core-ultra-7-265k-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-285k-245k-7800x3d-7900x-more So let's break that down, you get a CPU, that's maybe 20/25 percent worse in gaming, 75 bucks cheaper but vice versa 15-30% better in productivity while being newer and supporting faster ram and overall it's easy to cool and not massively less efficient than the 7800x3D.   And all of the gaming performance is less important if you play on 1440p or 4K anyway.   For me the intel sounds like a decent option and it's by far not a bad cpu.  Oh and who buys a 7800x3D or even 9800x3d and no GPU capable of playing 1440p or higher - maybe if you want to play super competitively.",buildapc,2025-08-31 21:50:29,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9963039, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 58, 'end': 63}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9473096, 'word': 'OC', 'start': 137, 'end': 139}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.69221205, 'word': 'Ba', 'start': 297, 'end': 299}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.35448784, 'word': '##urs Gate', 'start': 301, 'end': 309}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nbc7whg,"The 7800X3D actually has more of an advantage here because all of its 8 cores get to use the 3D V-Cache. That means the chip is more optimized for gaming, and it shows in benchmarks. The 7900X3D, even though it has more cores, only puts the 3D V-Cache on half of them. The rest of the cores are basically running without the cache, so they don’t help much in games. In fact, in a lot of modern AAA games at 1440p, the 7800X3D either matches or slightly beats the 7900X3D, which is kind of wild if you’re thinking “more cores = better.”  Another thing is money. The 7800X3D is usually cheaper than the 7900X3D, which is awesome if all you care about is gaming. You’re not losing performance, but you’re saving some cash that you can throw at a better GPU, faster RAM, or even a nicer case and cooler. Honestly, in games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Baldur’s Gate 3, the CPU isn’t the bottleneck, your GPU does most of the heavy lifting, but having a CPU that keeps up is still important.  As for waiting for the next-gen X3D chips, that’s a gamble. AMD hasn’t confirmed when those will drop, and it could be months before anything hits the market. If you wait, you’re basically stuck with your potato PC in the meantime. The 7800X3D is already super capable and will run pretty much any new AAA game at 1440p without breaking a sweat for years. It’s hard to justify holding out for something that might not even give you a huge boost for gaming.  All in all, if you’re building a pure gaming rig, the 7800X3D is probably the smarter pick. It’s fast, efficient, cheaper, and optimized for the games you actually want to play. Even though the 7900X3D has more cores, they don’t really matter in most gaming scenarios, both in 1080p, and 1440p. If you wanted to play in 4K, you could, just be prepared for lower 1% and .1% lows in modern titles. Personally, I would recommend going 1080p, as your system would be far too overkill for this resolution. If you have the money, aim for an oled monitor in 4K for maximum available usage of your system.

It was also common for an entry-level processor to be the Intel Core i3 (which is still weak today). With the arrival of the AM3+ (Bulldozer architecture), AMD began to gain more acceptance among gamers because they were very cheap compared to Intel and compensated for the lack of ""polish"" with brute force, making performance very similar. But despite this, they had heating issues, which bothered a lot of people. Still with this architecture, AMD launched the A-Series, which was a very cool APU (basically a Ryzen G prototype) that increased the presence of AMD chips in notebooks. Then with AM4 AMD overtook Intel in desktops, and years later, Apple launched the M1, also leaving Intel behind.

Other things are reportings which are rarely miss -even if things change it's usually from unforeseeable circumstances.

When consumer switches to 2nm, we'll see another large boost, not again that will likely be 2030+.  Servers and AI GPU will get 2nm first.  Followed by 1.8nm (which is a revision of 2nm).

I made it very clear that this was a serious inquiry from someone with credible background and not just a rando.  When I asked the AMD rep to move from reddit DM to emails, they refused. They asked me to continue our correspondence... via reddit DM. Lol. I ended up joining their developers Discord and also making my request there... but tbh the AMD developers Discord is basically a graveyard anyway.   The AMD rep publicly commented ""we're actively working on it"", then nothing happened for 3 months, in spite of me continuing to share my findings directly with them. Lastly, it appears that the guy blocked me (without any sort of communication), so I can't even send further inquiries.

The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.

Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7863968, 'word': 'RMA', 'start': 4, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99725705, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 20, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9996716, 'word': 'Germany', 'start': 140, 'end': 147}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7773049, 'word': 'RMA', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9982186, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 518, 'end': 523}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.86127424, 'word': 'R', 'start': 739, 'end': 740}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.997638, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1079, 'end': 1084}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99489284, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1920, 'end': 1925}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,mte086a,">Faster DDR5 DRAM chips are coming, even at high capacities, but existing DIMM standard is a bottleneck due to signal degradation.   Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work.
