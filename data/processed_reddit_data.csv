Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:17:12,-4,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5722218), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 0, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.87760466), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 8, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9204128), 'word': 'BPD', 'start': 233, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9109275), 'word': 'A', 'start': 924, 'end': 925}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7746179), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 930, 'end': 935}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4222402), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 970, 'end': 972}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7283281), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1055, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975158), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7844832), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9260799), 'word': 'IP', 'start': 1177, 'end': 1179}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.60086036), 'word': 'Arrow lake', 'start': 1188, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9970722), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1248, 'end': 1253}]",Tópico 4

E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

Intel,netnyfa,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny.

Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,28,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99808574), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6214537), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.52357626), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99834645), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83350486), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99116546), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8770928), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99863094), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9641192), 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9881471), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96866584), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5841442), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980452), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99846077), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99331963), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81863767), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89312124), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982552), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47448224), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9968098), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972773), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961228), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 4

It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years.

Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,8,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614332), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.604474), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.420649), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713005), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 3

They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm.

They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise.

Intel,nfb1vqa,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear. What I meant is that the IPC of the E-core is so much higher than Tiger Lake that it's performance at 2.6GHz is surprisingly close to desktop Tiger Lake at 5GHz.  I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

Intel,n1sr0i1,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",hardware,2025-07-03 17:17:52,0,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.73418415), 'word': 'C', 'start': 55, 'end': 56}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47523376), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 57, 'end': 59}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98281145), 'word': 'Gamer', 'start': 144, 'end': 149}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99500185), 'word': 'GT', 'start': 332, 'end': 334}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75578785), 'word': 'G', 'start': 375, 'end': 376}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8314824), 'word': 'GT 103', 'start': 407, 'end': 413}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62286806), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 458, 'end': 460}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98570216), 'word': 'G', 'start': 521, 'end': 522}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93719995), 'word': 'R', 'start': 605, 'end': 606}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.659845), 'word': '##X', 'start': 607, 'end': 608}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9311488), 'word': 'Gamer', 'start': 749, 'end': 754}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.42559758), 'word': 'N', 'start': 757, 'end': 758}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.44823474), 'word': '##us', 'start': 760, 'end': 762}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5290419), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 1000, 'end': 1002}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82402873), 'word': 'OC', 'start': 1062, 'end': 1064}]",Tópico 4

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

If you do, you need to both tune your ram subtimings as well as 9700x for the best performance.  And even then you may not catch the 7800x3d given the same tuning.

If you look at the US and UK in particular, who historically leaned more into capitalism and ""free"" market economics, both of their arts receive less relatively than they used to e.g. Hollywood writer strikes, UK councils gutting most of arts funding. In contrast, arts/culture is very healthy in Europe, which can be seen as more socialist.  Commercialism touches every aspect of society as those with power seek to consolidate it. There's no need to compete when you go past that point, you just gut costs/funding.   Take MS famously saying recently 30% of their code is generated by AI. That's purely for cost, and it's the result of living in a world where they no longer have any real competition, and no incentive to do better.   Now apply that to GPU's. It's not just gaming GPU's, but the actual mid-tier workstation cards that graphic designers, CAD designers, etc all rely on. A lot of arts and engineering also actually rely on GPU's now, as a side note.   NVIDIA can claim they live in a cost driven environment all they want. They live in a profit driven world appeasing shareholders short term.  Does this mean they *have* to be anti-consumer?

I would say the biggest issue right now is that a lot of development has been put into making graphics *dynamic* again (baked light maps are very performant solutions to global illumination, but also enforced highly static worlds, whereas ray tracing can be fully dynamic), while the state of game development still hasn't really caught up with that.

I also have a Ryzen 5 5600x and I can assure you, the CPU overhead thing is overblown. There's only one game I played where it was a thing and that is CS2, which is instantly fixable by using Vulkan instead of DirectX 11. As long as your CPU supports Rebar and PCIe 4.0, you're good to go. Intel also recently announced Xess 3.0 which also has full support for older cards including MFG. Although Intel hasn't made any comparative pictures between versions, I expect Xess 3.0 to make things a little tighter with DLSS and FSR 4.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 4

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.780761), 'word': 'YouTube', 'start': 186, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.632216), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 202, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89879507), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52583975), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 211, 'end': 213}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71377695), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 213, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56497085), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 266, 'end': 268}]",Tópico 5

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",AMD,2024-04-01 02:18:57,28,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96870226), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9156764), 'word': 'I', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9579422), 'word': 'M', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6767603), 'word': 'N', 'start': 78, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.69673014), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 79, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8865069), 'word': '##DI', 'start': 81, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98826766), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 142, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81870246), 'word': 'VFIO', 'start': 220, 'end': 224}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004071), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 270, 'end': 273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97644997), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 355, 'end': 358}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78370017), 'word': 'V', 'start': 478, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9868846), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8120332), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 637, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40551057), 'word': 'M', 'start': 679, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7868693), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 721, 'end': 727}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.657153), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 746, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99238694), 'word': 'Debian', 'start': 835, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86615694), 'word': 'Proxmox', 'start': 865, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936753), 'word': 'N', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81987095), 'word': '##utanix', 'start': 906, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9508743), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 923, 'end': 929}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9956404), 'word': 'Broadcom', 'start': 941, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9882114), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7132545), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93465674), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1279, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91439724), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658943), 'word': 'Spice', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 1

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.949649), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378605), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84053415), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6853485), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 5

And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.

Intel,nnz3axo,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one.

In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games.

That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

AMD,nmbgrrq,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,nmeds5z,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one. And the passage of time now positions early RDNA as a temporary measure, a stopgap until AMD figures out how to get back in the fight.  It remains quietly amusing how utterly wrong the YouTubers and online forums have misread the future about five-six years ago. Architecture/features/support, as it turns out, matter more than raster parity at a 5-10% discount.",hardware,2025-10-31 16:54:04,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9718374), 'word': 'R', 'start': 76, 'end': 77}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.42423245), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 78, 'end': 80}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91033673), 'word': 'R', 'start': 105, 'end': 106}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5144856), 'word': 'R', 'start': 117, 'end': 118}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76329285), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 119, 'end': 121}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6393619), 'word': 'R', 'start': 305, 'end': 306}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94805515), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 402, 'end': 406}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.73335314), 'word': 'RX', 'start': 464, 'end': 466}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93588954), 'word': 'R', 'start': 536, 'end': 537}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97308636), 'word': 'HairWorks', 'start': 696, 'end': 705}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95992434), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 806, 'end': 808}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98625195), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 880, 'end': 883}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56247264), 'word': 'R', 'start': 907, 'end': 908}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.3213744), 'word': 'R', 'start': 917, 'end': 918}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50909925), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1076, 'end': 1077}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5630991), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1100, 'end': 1101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9142218), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1187, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.3297731), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 1188, 'end': 1190}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83098423), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 1190, 'end': 1193}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91309756), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1209, 'end': 1210}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96880114), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1246, 'end': 1247}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5374484), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1485, 'end': 1486}]",Tópico 3

AMD,nmbeqwq,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it.

AMD and Intel GPUs run on open source drivers on Linux. Even all Nvidia RTX (GTX 16xx too) are getting more love on Linux nowadays.  Features and general improvements are still coming for Vega which I ran until recently. The oldest supported AMD GPUs on Linux are from the HD79xx series (real, not rebranded chips) from around 2012-2013 if I remember.   By supported I meant useful for daily use and normal consumers.  Meaning that all GPUs stated in the video are still completely fine, same goes for the USB-C output of the RX79xx.  In my eyes that's all planned obsolescence which here is irrelevant because of open source drivers. The corporations but also hundreds of free developers take part in. Should a corpo bail out then you still have the massive community doing its best to keep your ""old"" hardware out the landfill.

AMD,nmkm4ow,"Fine wine definitely was a thing back with the GCN architecture. Part of GPU drivers is bug fixes, but the whole game ready part is Nvidia/AMD optimizing games for the developer. Back with GCN the AMD architecture was a bit more complex and developers used it poorly. Developers did stupid things like tessellating concrete barriers and the surface of the water to hell and back. So over time you would have real gains and the AMD cards would have a better lifespan than their Nvidia counterparts. The RX 580 was phenomenal.  I would call the fine wine back in the day more shitty developers than shitty drivers.  Fine wine ended with RDNA, it was much simpler to optimize and all over the consoles. That means RX 5000 series going forward don't get those same bumps over time and we've seen it.

AMD,nmbrxh6,">AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs.  That's not what they do. They freeze development by branching the code bases off. This effectively means they no longer do development on the legacy branch.   Even in theory fixing bugs in old unmaintained code is difficult because it stops looking like the cold you're working on on a  regular basis. But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing. This happens quite frequently. These GPUs are only a few years old , some 5 years max.   >If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it.   They won't. They don't do any of this in the legacy branch for Vega.  >If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  They've never done this for the legacy Vega branch. It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.   Yes this applies to all sorts of GCN hardware because they're extremely capable still. You can do shader emulated ray tracing on Vega and RDNA1 with playable performance.on Linux. There are YouTube videos of people showing Indiana Jones off running on this hardware.

AMD,nmdmdmo,"> On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level, and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.  I think that's a little bit unfair towards AMD. On the kernel side, they put in the work with amdgpu, writing parts of it from scratch *and* getting it being accepted into the mainline kernel - which is a steep barrier to entry (the battles on the LKML were a fascinating read :) ), but which makes long-term support infinitely more viable due to the nature of Linux kernel development.

AMD,nmfdrzc,"> The adapter cable was originally meant to provide added convenience for Valve Index users, making it so they could rely on a single USB-C connection to the headset rather than requiring separate physical connections for video, USB, and power.  > However, for multiple technical reasons we no longer believe that the product would deliver that added convenience. Foremost on that list is reliability. Our current testing indicates the VR connection may fail to establish in a reliable manner. Additionally, Virtual Link technology has not been widely adopted by manufacturers, laptops in particular (where a single connection could be the most beneficial), translating to very few PCs having viable ports for the connection.  PSVR2 also does not use VirtualLink. It needs a port capable of DP Alt Mode and 12v USB PD. VirtualLink ports happen to be compatible. It's an important distinction. It doesn't repurpose the USB 2.0 data pins for 3.0 speeds, which is part of the VirtualLink spec and was the issue.   https://steamcommunity.com/app/992490/discussions/17/3879344463500344882/",hardware,2025-10-31 19:58:04,12,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99371576), 'word': 'Valve Index', 'start': 74, 'end': 85}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99561864), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 134, 'end': 137}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.969232), 'word': 'C', 'start': 138, 'end': 139}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9727367), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 229, 'end': 232}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.671678), 'word': 'V', 'start': 436, 'end': 437}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8672502), 'word': 'Virtual Link', 'start': 508, 'end': 520}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.63227373), 'word': 'PSVR', 'start': 727, 'end': 731}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6844166), 'word': 'VirtualLink', 'start': 751, 'end': 762}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9263536), 'word': 'D', 'start': 791, 'end': 792}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7745913), 'word': 'Mode', 'start': 798, 'end': 802}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8224616), 'word': 'USB PD', 'start': 811, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47668645), 'word': 'VirtualL', 'start': 819, 'end': 827}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62345296), 'word': '##ink', 'start': 827, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9779498), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 918, 'end': 921}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64587), 'word': 'VirtualL', 'start': 973, 'end': 981}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51471984), 'word': '##ink', 'start': 981, 'end': 984}]",Tópico 1

The main downside was that the BIOS was pretty clunky. Looked very dated, it was hard to find features that the board did have (enabling RAM EXPO was a bit fiddly, but to be fair once I enabled it it worked great with no tweaking required) and it listed features that the board didn't have (There was a toggle for Intel Turbo Boost and hyperthreading... on an AMD board...). The RGB software also was pretty bad, very few RGB modes, slow and unresponsive, and the installer was in Mandarin.

My end review is that the product itself was OK with a few QoL problems but nothing major, but it's totally worth spending another $20 to get something like a Gigabyte B650M Gaming, or an ASUS B650M AYW, just because BIOS and software will be better, you're far more likely to keep getting BIOS updates from a major brand, and if you ever need to warranty claim something I'd rather try my luck with a big brand over Maxsun.",hardware,2025-11-06 22:37:02,2,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65672684), 'word': 'Max', 'start': 15, 'end': 18}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5745012), 'word': '##sun', 'start': 18, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8185121), 'word': 'B65', 'start': 22, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8023405), 'word': 'Challenger Ice Wi', 'start': 28, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.89474946), 'word': 'Fi', 'start': 46, 'end': 48}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.971995), 'word': 'Aussie', 'start': 258, 'end': 264}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8845353), 'word': 'Intel Turbo Boost', 'start': 589, 'end': 606}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.92579794), 'word': 'R', 'start': 654, 'end': 655}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9442985), 'word': 'R', 'start': 697, 'end': 698}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99932516), 'word': 'Mandarin', 'start': 756, 'end': 764}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9988549), 'word': 'Western', 'start': 820, 'end': 827}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99924505), 'word': 'English', 'start': 874, 'end': 881}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7946327), 'word': 'G', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1045}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9917437), 'word': 'Maxsun', 'start': 1302, 'end': 1308}]",Tópico 4

Similarly, there were some bright spots during Intel's run for AMD, where the Phenom II in particular was a very solid upper midrange platform and the Athlon II's dervied from it were solid mid range to budget choices when taking cost into consider. That said, the construction cores (Bulldozer, Piledriver, Excavator) we're even less competitive than Netburst. There was essentially no redeeming factor to them (outside of super niche APU based builds where you could have a somewhat useful rig for less than the cost of a decent GPU). Either people have forgotten or simply weren't around for this era and apply the Ryzen shine to those pitiful FX chips. Also, Zen1 wasn't really all that great for gaming either, it was good value at the 1600~1700 model range but it was still a generation or two behind intel (again the current success of the line gets retroactively applied here).

AMD,no2199r,"Looks great, but I do have a few questions.  CPU: I will use it mostly for gaming, but I tend to code every once and awhile with unity/vs2022, and while I don't know a whole lot, I know more cores usually means better performance when handling many tasks which I will need. If its negligible for that then I'll probably switch to the 9600x just because it is a lot cheaper.  GPU: Is the 9070XT truly necessary? I'm looking at the ""Gigabyte GAMING OC Radeon RX 9060 XT 16 GB Video Card"" and considering its about $200 cheaper, I might want that instead. I don't need the highest of qualities (1080p is fine for me, coming from a laptop with an i3 with 2 cores and integrated uhd graphics), as long as it can run games and my other needs smoothly, i can lose out on the 1440p or 4k. All I need it to do is run Ultra 1080p on games, I'll even settle for high considering anything other than ""the lowest possible settings"" is where I'm at currently. I'd ignore it and go with my gut but after a very quick search I saw the 9070 is quite a bit faster than the 9060, but once again, if the 9060 can handle what I need it too at 1080p ultra/high, I will take it for $200 less.

AMD,nnxhk8d,"Everytime this happens, people cry foul about terrible journalism this or that, but... you guys (and me too, I'm involved on both sides) want the info about the leaks and rumors on upcoming hardware, or for example news warning about raising prices.   If we as authors ignored all this info and just wrote articles about press releases and product launches (yes, some angry readers have lectured me to do just that on not just one ocasion), you wouldn't like it either. And rightfully, because that would be useless.  A wise man once wrote that the information that ""it rained yesterday"" or ""it rains now"" is worthless, but ""it will rain tomorrow"" is something that has value. And that holds even if the information is not guaranteed (see weather forecast). Knowing about future stuff or being warned about future problems has it's value, often very high. The value is also higher if the information is available more in advance (""I know everybody sees the cloud but hear, it's going to rain in 2 minutes!"")   And that is why you (and me too as well) go to the internet and look for these kinds of news. People who get mad and selfrighteously offended (I suspect some enjoy the feeling of superiority?) when stuff like this happens miss the point, IMHO.  It's pointless to be offended about ""not checking extra sources/facts"" in context of hardware leaks. The leak itself more often than not tends to be the only source of the information. Sometimes somebody with contacts can ask people they know, but far from always. You guys act like you don't want to see anything that is ""not confirmed"" to be printed/published - but that is a pretty much not true. If you got what you wished in this regard, we would stay mostly blind about future hardware. You would probably not be satisfied. Actually, if you really preferred it to be like that, you can just not be following the leak churn on websites and social networks... but you probably want to, given how you are here.  Good HW news journalism (when we are talking about covering upcoming hardware and leaks like this) is not really about checking everything. What you mostly want is for the editors to have decent experience and insight, good intuition and good knowledge so that they are good at deciding what to rule out as nonsense, obvious fake or unlikely, and what to let through and publish as ""potentially good and interesting information that is not guaranteed, but useful to be aware of."" Resisting sensationalism and being able to tell bad sources from good is part of that.  (IMHO, VideoCardz tends to be among the better sites in that regard. If you only want to follow only a single news site, better idea for it to be VideoCardz than say, WCCFtech, heh. From the ones that are being called out, I follow others too, but even TPU and Tom's Hardware tend to be less reliable in this sort of sieving and judging the rumors).  \---------------------  And separately, thanks for the write-up, OP!",pcmasterrace,2025-11-09 13:51:54,2,Negative,Anger,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.92776006), 'word': 'I', 'start': 1248, 'end': 1249}]",Tópico 4

Or Hell Divers 2 that had issues at launch, or Dying light 2 that had RGB laser show bug outside the Radeon boost issues the game had for 1 and half year or so more or less.  As well as some unity based games having random driver timeouts on least RDNA3 due those games not handling the high clock speeds that well on stock.  They may be dropping support, but they never properly supported these gpu's to begin with and now RDNA3 we just waiting for games to be playable, by the time it gets fixed it wont matter anymore, i could not play wow for example during the entire Dragonflight expansion and wasted 200+ euros on a game and subscription that i could not play for almost entire expansion, so i am happy i can finally play it again.  Hopefully i can as well during midnight expansion which has its first beta on 11 november now.  The attitude AMD often has oh its just hardware issue 99% of the time its a driver issue and their vanguard program users unable to reproduce issues, simply due lack of information required to fix these issues, because sometimes its not easy to reproduce however for those having issues, avoiding the issue is as simple as simply not playing the game with the issue, as much that sucks.  And there is the Radeon tax you pay you only get to play what the vanguard program users like to play, you want to play that latest game that AMD has not enough users playing well tough luck and sometimes its also because NVIDIA simply makes the game unavaible until launch so AMD can only fix it as soon as its released, so NVIDIA wins by default because AMD cannot support the game to begin with at launch.     So yeah that AMD is just straight out saying they putting RDNA1/2 in Maintenaince mode not supporting the latest games really pisses me off, but its not like they doing that right now anyway even RDNA4 suffers from issues with games at launch.  But i will compliment AMD for finally working with game devs these days they been doing that for over a year or 2 now and probably longer, but they have to figure out how to do things better, because this is not acceptable.  I could litterally spend time making memes out of these driver issues and actual proof that these issues are actually real driver issues, but i do not like a burnout or work for free, which is why i rejected joining the vanguard program few times in the past, alto i have cooperated with some users figuring things out even testing things, but AMD should honestly do this them self.  But i am still avaible to do so eitherway if i am able to do that, but as some one hat has no job AMD could really do something about it and start hiring people for these type of things, so they can actually fix things rather then ignore these issues.",AMD,2025-10-31 23:35:56,1,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9729138), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 220, 'end': 223}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95217264), 'word': 'Hell Divers 2', 'start': 252, 'end': 265}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98256785), 'word': 'R', 'start': 319, 'end': 320}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7125902), 'word': 'Radeon', 'start': 350, 'end': 356}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.51967144), 'word': 'R', 'start': 673, 'end': 674}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7152402), 'word': 'Dragonflight', 'start': 822, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9576419), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1098, 'end': 1101}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8146205), 'word': 'Radeon', 'start': 1490, 'end': 1496}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.92949545), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1615, 'end': 1618}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83821136), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1695, 'end': 1701}]",Tópico 3

AMD,nmi2iwq,"Laptop iGPUs get used for a ton of gaming (usually on potato settings or old/indie games, but engine devs still want to be able to rip out old code paths and be able to rely on modern features since eg. modern vulkan is now much simpler than vulkan 1.0 was, while also having new faster ways to do things).  Desktops and browsers are also moving to Vulkan+DX12 (Gnome's vulkan compositor, chrome and firefox are both shipping vulkan+dx12 backends and requiring them for full webgpu support, etc).  The issue is also when hardware support is ended early like this, then it pushes back the time when developers can start requiring new features to run software, and alternative code paths for hardware that lacks whatever required feature support aren't free to develop or maintain (and in some cases mean you essentially have 2 separate renderers, eg. bindless vs traditional/non-bindless).

When using Relive, if I launch a game and record any gameplay using Relive, Adrenalin of course creates a folder for that game in the designated folder. For Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), it seemed to create a folder that has permissions issues, to put it lightly. I cannot delete the folder and I cannot play any media that's been recorded to it. If I copy or cut the media out into another folder, it plays fine.  Just recently the drive I have been using for Relive media has had issues, so I created a new folder for it on a seperate, newer NVME drive. I put the earlier issues down to just the drive failing and that Adrenalin wasn't at fault at all. I uninstalled Adrenalin, used DDU and did a completely fresh install. Only now, can you guess what has happened? Yep, the exact same thing. Media recorded in the Adrenalin-created Battlefront II folder does not play until cut or copied out of it, and despite my setting user permissions on the main base folder itself, I can't delete the damn thing. Last night it said I didn't have permission. Today, just trying now before writing this message, Windows is telling me the folder doesn't exist.

If it comes back with any errors, that means any video driver issues you had, could have been caused by CPU/memory problems.  (Correction: I had one strange issue with Minecraft (Java) and Complementary Reimagined 5.5.1 shader, where \~5% of the time when I used a bed to sleep, I would get a driver timeout, but I assumed it was a bad combination of mods and the shader I was using.

AMD,ngmx0bu,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 3

Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3.

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Intel,2025-06-27 19:06:33,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82722825), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 146, 'end': 148}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.58519953), 'word': 'Mac', 'start': 253, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96073776), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 338, 'end': 340}]",Tópico 4

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,navgo8f,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications.
