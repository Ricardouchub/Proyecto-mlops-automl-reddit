Intel,ntcj3az,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**.

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3.

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:17:12,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5722218), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 0, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.87760466), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 8, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9204128), 'word': 'BPD', 'start': 233, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9109275), 'word': 'A', 'start': 924, 'end': 925}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7746179), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 930, 'end': 935}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4222402), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 970, 'end': 972}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7283281), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1055, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975158), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7844832), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9260799), 'word': 'IP', 'start': 1177, 'end': 1179}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.60086036), 'word': 'Arrow lake', 'start': 1188, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9970722), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1248, 'end': 1253}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nnhqy1t,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",hardware,2025-10-10 19:19:56,-3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5901536), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 478, 'end': 480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95915806), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 657, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5589056), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 840, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84580344), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 861, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8949823), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 872, 'end': 874}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83673733), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 897, 'end': 899}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9113381), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 960, 'end': 967}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90570134), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1045, 'end': 1051}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8788991), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1331, 'end': 1337}]",Tópico 4

Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel?

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Frame gen is fine, but no RT denoiser like AMD and Nvidia is something that could use resolving, but the biggest is XESS XMX slipping into a relatively distant fourth place behind DLSS transformer, FSR ML, and DLSS CNN. A new transformer based architecture could really deliver a boost they need.    As for panther lake it is promising. An efficient yet reasonably powerful architecture with ML hardware for XESS is quite compelling in the gaming space with laptops and handhelds, but also low power laptops. Great encoding and decoding with WiFi 7 is quite nice too. Seemingly it will deliver better performance than stuff like the z2 extreme in the handheld market which is something we desperately need since it was such an incremental jump. Hopefully more big manufacturers consider Intel.   Nova lake is a lot of question marks right now, but it might be reasonably competent which is what we need from Intel.

Intel,nt07q12,"You keep repeating the idea that “the 4070S was already sold, so nothing changes,” which tells me you’re stuck in the sunk cost fallacy. Nvidia getting money from the original sale is irrelevant to the next decision. What matters in economics is marginal demand. When someone sells their 4070S and chooses Intel for their next GPU, they remove one potential new Nvidia sale (the buyer of the used card may otherwise have purchased new) and simultaneously create one new Intel sale. Those marginal shifts are exactly how incumbents lose revenue and challengers gain market share. Sunk revenue doesn’t grant Nvidia permanent immunity from switching behavior.  A strong second hand market absolutely hurts Nvidia’s future sales. It lowers the effective cost of GPU ownership, pushes price sensitive buyers into used units instead of new ones, and reduces Nvidia’s pricing power. This is standard industrial organization theory used goods cannibalize new goods. Selling the 4070S does not “give Nvidia money,” it gives someone else a path to avoid paying Nvidia at all. Then replacing that card with Intel means Intel gets fresh revenue while Nvidia gets zero. Combine both actions and the net effect is Nvidia loses one new sale, Intel gains one new sale. That is the literal mechanism by which competition grows.  And pretending that “one person doesn’t matter” ignores how collective marginal actions scale. If even a small percentage of consumers switch from buying new Nvidia cards (~€600 on average) to Intel instead, the foregone revenue becomes massive. For example, 100,000 people doing this is €60 million Nvidia doesn’t get and €60 million Intel gains. That’s not “inconsequential”, that’s enough to change pricing strategy, product roadmaps, and R&D priorities. Markets don’t change because one individual defects they change when many individuals do, and that only happens if people stop rationalizing inaction with the sunk cost excuses you’re using.  Your whole argument hinges on a single transaction worldview, as if each GPU purchase is isolated. But the GPU market is dynamic. Nvidia’s future behavior depends on demand elasticity, competitors’ traction, and consumer switching. Selling your Nvidia card and buying Intel is a strategic choice that weakens incumbent dominance, strengthens pricing competition, and signals that alternatives are viable. Yes, you shouldn’t blindly buy Intel if the product is bad but when Intel is competitive, shifting demand is exactly how you incentivize innovation and better pricing across the board.

I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 3

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,70,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98579425), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6807291), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.53338933), 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8288868), 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8976541), 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87239146), 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87449735), 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52110374), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.63087755), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9507805), 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5053189), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8337852), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69437224), 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5678201), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6214103), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6280626), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 3

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 5

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.949649), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378605), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84053415), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6853485), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 3

There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling.

Intel,nnz3axo,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU.

Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Intel,2025-11-06 07:19:59,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51401126), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 292, 'end': 294}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9971359), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 314, 'end': 319}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98042005), 'word': 'PowerVia', 'start': 489, 'end': 497}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99182194), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 647, 'end': 649}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98752546), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 899, 'end': 902}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9622613), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 995, 'end': 1005}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98830426), 'word': 'Fire Range', 'start': 1016, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80416733), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 1204, 'end': 1206}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49430886), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1316, 'end': 1317}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9173438), 'word': 'U', 'start': 1512, 'end': 1513}]",Tópico 1

Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread.

Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

The 5700XT draws the same power as 2080ti while being way slower and has no feature, 7900XTX consume more power than 4090 while being destroyed in everything, even newest 9070XT consumes about 100W higher than 5070Ti even though it's still slightly worse, this might not be relevant in PC at all, but for Laptop this is super crucial, and AMD completely failed at this.

AMD,nvf1ri4,">My 5090 goes from ~40W to 90W by just plugging in a second display while doing nothing  Yea that's not normal, 2 displays have been fine on nvidia cards for... well as long as I've had an nvidia card so 2017, to stay in idle memory speed state and it's only couple of watts more. Maybe if you go high enough it changes like two 4k240 displays or one/both being 1440p500, but 4k240 + 4k144 brief moment i had that combo didn't do it on a 4070ti and was fully idle state. Or you have some power settings cranked up maybe those effect things. Obviously interacting with like browser stuff with 2 high refresh/res monitors does have more brief spikes than a single panel would, but that's not idle.    3 is a bit of mixed bag, but even that it much better than it used to be like ~4-5 years ago, when 3 monitors of any kind was max memory speed state and can still get idle at 3 panels if the refresh rates of all panels isn't high and even then it might go to half memory speed state instead of full speed on some specific combo. I do remember some talk about how the specific model also might affect things due to... something, rather than just pure refresh/res combo. thought that was mainly for 3(+) panels where it mattered, but maybe that could be what's happening even with just 2 panels.",hardware,2025-12-22 19:15:41,1,Neutral,Neutral,[],Tópico 3

I don't really care about the upscaling part of it, the 6800 chewed up any game i threw at it at 1440p without RT.

The roadmap has more effect, and TSMC, Samsung, or Intel being in the picture is rarely used to drive prices lower.   Sure competition among fabs and packagers may set the ballpark of costs. But designers rarely use the threat of going with a different process to get a lower/better price from TSMC, Samsung, etc.   If AMD is going w Samsung it is likely because Samsung's roadmap may align w AMD requirements for a specific design.   The reason why this news may be unlikely is that AMD does not have an stablished silicon team with Samsung (that I am aware of). And that usually is how you can tell any type of significant volume from a large design team is going to be on a given foundry.   However Samsung does have a very nice roadmap for the type of large dies AMD has in their pipeline for their monolithic SoCs (mainly their APUs and GPUs). So there could be some alignment there.

AMD,nuk1fn8,"> It definitely feels like an ego thing that they didn't just copy Ryzen's super successful and ultimately quite straightforward chiplet scaling strategy.  Well, I think Intel at least *tried* to copy AMD's chiplet-paradigm helplessly for the last couple of years …  It seems that Intel was taken totally by surprise on anything Chiplets and got caught with their pants down (again), when AMD brought it this quick to market, when having worked on them for a decade plus.  Though IF Intel would already worked on anything *disintegrated silicon* for said 10 years by then (like Intel claimed when announcing their heterogenous '*Mix and Match*'-approach around 2018), *Intel would* ***not*** *have needed +6 years for finally reaching a fairly comparable design-approach* only half a decade later in 2023 with Meteor&nbsp;Lake (also Arrow Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Ponte Vecchio).  Since sure enough, all these disintegrated designs \*somehow\* brought Intel truly massive troubles engineering-wise and they had tremendous difficulties to overcome those for years — The years-long horror-stories over validation and dead-on silicon past tape-outs on *Sapphire Rapids* and *Ponte Vecchio* for example are testament to that … *Meteor Lake* was also everything but a performer.  ---- The issue at hand for Intel was quite many-layered …  * Intel hardly knew how to do it (despite claiming otherwise for years). *Shocker!*  * Intel had no real equivalent to AMD's SuperGlue aka *Infinity&nbsp;Fabric*™   That's for sure the most striking one, obviously — The reason they had to wait for PCi-E 5.0 to become a thing, for ""Intel's"" *CXL* to finalize upon it (which in itself is basically just AMD's former *CCIX* in disguise as Copy-pasta anyway done out of spite).  * Intel haven't remotely had adopted a design-strategy by then, which would've offered so to speak ""intelligent"" chiplets/tiles, which could be freely thrown together randomly at will on a (PCi-E) bus (which AMD actually evidently can with their CCX and I/O-dies since ages).  So Intel's claims before the press in 2018, of already working on disintegrated silicon since years already (and that AMD *weren't* actually as spearheading as they became), was pure virtue-signaling, a blatant lie.  As a result, Intel's IP-blocks still remained virtually *dumb* (in the sense of *head*|*less*) for years on out afterwards and most of it had to be *re-engineered from scratch* in all this other trouble like lay-offs, down-sizing or Intel's road-maps being constantly thrown out again (only to start over once more).  The reason why AMD had a years-long edge on chiplets from the onset, was since Intel just couldn't place or handle the stuff as ***independent*** *IP-blocks* — Everything was grown intercoupled and -linked together.  AMD on the other hand already had a decade-long headstart, due to their already well-tuned modular concept of IP-blocks (building-block principle with IP-blocks to freely chose from) attuned for the console-era from back then for the console-contracts (those, Intel always made fun of since).  So Intel allegedly been working on chiplet-esque designs for years already, was utter bullsh!t, and that's actually the sole reason WHY Intel struggled so hard for years with anything Tiles — They started at 0.",hardware,2025-12-17 18:49:09,1,Neutral,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.99109393), 'word': 'R', 'start': 67, 'end': 68}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.32849273), 'word': '##zen', 'start': 69, 'end': 72}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986168), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 170, 'end': 175}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99442935), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 201, 'end': 204}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99776673), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 281, 'end': 286}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.43427482), 'word': 'Chip', 'start': 329, 'end': 333}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961066), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 389, 'end': 392}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94875264), 'word': 'IF Intel', 'start': 480, 'end': 488}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99805945), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 578, 'end': 583}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9973374), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 669, 'end': 674}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8920873), 'word': 'Meteor &', 'start': 810, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6621621), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 822, 'end': 826}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.83863896), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 833, 'end': 843}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9301769), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 845, 'end': 847}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9556484), 'word': '##pphire Rapids', 'start': 847, 'end': 860}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9387085), 'word': 'Ponte Vecchio', 'start': 862, 'end': 875}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9979424), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 950, 'end': 955}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.7426385), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 1148, 'end': 1150}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.80740285), 'word': '##pphire Rapids', 'start': 1150, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.76743203), 'word': 'Pont', 'start': 1170, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.78894603), 'word': '##e Vecchi', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1182}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6195514), 'word': '##o', 'start': 1182, 'end': 1183}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8411257), 'word': 'Met', 'start': 1222, 'end': 1225}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49192914), 'word': '##eor', 'start': 1225, 'end': 1228}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.65434957), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 1229, 'end': 1233}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980032), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1305}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1334, 'end': 1339}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9976815), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1419, 'end': 1424}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98872715), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1451, 'end': 1454}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6440427), 'word': '##G', 'start': 1462, 'end': 1463}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.677617), 'word': 'Infinity', 'start': 1472, 'end': 1480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98793495), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1614, 'end': 1619}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9870587), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1760, 'end': 1765}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45422563), 'word': 'O', 'start': 2014, 'end': 2015}]",Tópico 4

Three years in advance, you are kicking the tires on the PDK and making sure the node will achieve your goals for your design.  That is not so expensive you cannot do it for multiple foundries.  The next step, is finalizing the layout for masks, which culminates in the tape-out.  You could do that for multiple processes, but it does not make much sense, as you should have known which process you prefer before that step.  Masks are very expensive so you don't want to make them for two different processes.  So tape out is the last chance you have to make a foundry decision, but you should make it months before that.  As an example, AMD announced back in April that Venice chiplets taped out on TSMC 2nm.  Venice is going to be included in Helios racks that are being delivered in Q3 next year.  So maybe a little less than 1.5 years from tapeout to product.  Add in the time for doing the physical layout, and you get pretty close to 2 years.

If you just want to replace the CPU, you unscrew 4 screws to remove your cooler/AIO pump head, pop open the socket, put your new CPU in, repaste and remount the cooler, plug some fans back in if necessary, and you're good. Maybe remove the GPU if you're really pressed for space.  When changing an entire motherboard, you have to unmount the cooler, remove the GPU, unplug every cable plugged into the motherboard, possibly remove some AIO fans/the radiator (or just fans in general) from the case if they're getting in the way of the motherboard screws, remove the motherboard, and remove any SSDs you want to reuse.   Then you have to put everything (CPU, SSDs, RAM) on the new motherboard, put the new motherboard in, repaste and remount the cooler, remount any fans you had to take off and plug them back into the motherboard, plug all your PSU cables again, then put your GPU back into place.  You basically have to redo a big chunk of the entire build process. Not to invalidate what you said, maybe you are proficient enough that all that would only take you 10 additional minutes.

AMD,nu6lxak,"Dies are not, and have really never been the main cost driver in GPUs.   Dies were absolutely a bit cheaper back in like 2017, but it's not by the huge amount that people believe. These days the die is the most expensive individual piece of a GPU, but not anywhere near the majority of the cost.  The GB203 in a 5070Ti or 5080 costs roughly $100 assuming 95% yields and 18k per wafer (95% viable for 5080 or 5070Ti). A 1080Ti die (GP102) would've cost about $50 adjusted for inflation.   So yes, the dies are more expensive, but they have gone from like 7% of the total price the end user pays for a mid tier to high end GPU, to about 10-13%.   The main cost driver for GPUs is not the dies, but the fact that Nvidia can make so much more money elsewhere, and need to jack up prices in order to justify the continued existence of their consumer GPU business. A wafer used to produce GB203s is a wafer out of Nvidias wafer allocation that can't be used to produce much higher margin GB200s. Every wafer of Nvidia's allocation not used to produce GB200s basically costs Nvidia to lose tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars they would have made in additional profits. By raising consumer prices they can somewhat soften that blow, hence why they have continued to go up.  N2 is probably where the wafer costs will actually start being a significant cost driver if Nvidia/AMD want to maintain margins, but we should still only be talking consumer price increases of perhaps 10-15% to maintain those margins. Obviously Nvidia and AMD will shrink the dies and jack up their prices much higher anyway, then shift the blame onto TSMC and their wafer prices. But there is really no reason they need those huge price increases for the move to N2 to make sense financially.  Shrinking the die on lower tier cards may be more justified though, as die costs do actually make up a large component of the manufacturing cost there.",hardware,2025-12-15 16:58:37,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.859307), 'word': 'GB', 'start': 301, 'end': 303}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9618333), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 710, 'end': 716}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5799957), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 845, 'end': 847}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7608499), 'word': 'GB', 'start': 883, 'end': 885}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8908985), 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 908, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40643677), 'word': '##ias', 'start': 912, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98671746), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1005, 'end': 1011}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7178555), 'word': 'GB', 'start': 1045, 'end': 1047}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9576502), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1068, 'end': 1074}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98425937), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1369, 'end': 1375}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.839424), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1376, 'end': 1379}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9644206), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1522, 'end': 1528}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98414946), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1533, 'end': 1536}]",Tópico 1

Here he just plays into completely opposite direction, with ONLY thing even remotely comparable being him saying ""but they didn't mention image quality and latency on slides"".  > He even completely ignores AMD ""performance"" slides with FG in them, slides included in Redstone promo materials he is reviewing. Something he is bringing about NVidia a year after they did it and in completely unrelated videos.   2a) What I should've done is watched the video from three days ago and pointed out that it's 1) a video specifically about frame gen, and not the release of a batch of AI shite technology - you'd expect the focus (and resulting evaluation / criticism / praise) to be around the topic. In my eyes, I'd expect any negativity around a certain subject to be more prominent on a video specifically about that topic.  2b) what I DID do was immediately jump on the first (what I saw as) quantitive flaw and go ""ha dickhead, he literally refers to AMD's shit as fake frames within a few minutes of the video, thus proving no bias about AMD"" - which tbh still seems the right conclusion in my head, but it's not adressing the point he was making - **nvidia is fake frames 100% of time, AMD is when we feel like it**.

I've had this exact (sorta) debate before and it ends up with the effort you've put into quantifying your point being a waste"".

AMD,nurvfj3,"First, thank you for this and the time you took to put it together. A few things; I want a v5 SSD that can do 14,7 on the transfer - that's a 9100 Pro. The case would require at least one additional fan - but do we really need fans up top?: I think 3 in front and 1 in back with the Phantom Spirit is fine. I do agree after really thinking about this - AIO pumps always go bad after 5+ years. Air fans; just replace them as they start to make noise. Air really is the best choice, so that saves a ton of money.  I don't need 64GB. 32GB is fine.  As for the 5080, that would require a 1000w PSU. There's no question the 5080 is faster and DLSS is better than FSR. But is the 15% difference worth $400? Not quite sure TBH. Plus the 5080 you linked has pretty bad reviews.

AMD,nv6di2r,"Looks like a solid build, the systems should play the games they like no problem and allow them to play even more demanding games. The only thing I might recommend is that if you can find motherboards for the same price or even cheaper that are ATX rather than micro ATX then the systems will be easier to build and upgrade over time. Micro ATX (or mATX) are pretty small and can make working on them cramped. You can usually get better upgrade options (more RAM slots, more SSD slots, more connectors, I/O ports) with an ATX board so the systems will be more upgradable / flexible down the road.  To be clear your builds will work totally fine, mATX motherboards should be compatible with your ATX case, as well as all the other parts.  If the parts don’t all show up by Christmas something you could do is print of the PCPartpicker build list and put them in cards, wrap up the parts you do have on hand, and just tell them that the rest of the parts on that list are coming.

When it comes to AMD hardware, Sapphire and Power Color are considered the best when it comes to warranty and overall value.

AMD,nutrvid,"> Even if am4 chips would cost same as am5  I mean that's a big if.  It really depends on what kind of yields they can get on the machine that does the 5500x3d.  If they're getting low yields for 5700x3d on the the machine, there's not much point to binning as such.  Given the 5500 74mm² and the 800 standard wafer, that's like ~890 dies per wafer if none are bad.  If each wafer is only yielding 10% or less dies that can be binned 5700x3d, it's going to be more than the AM5 equal in cost.  So at least 90 or more of those have to meet the 5700 testing.  And my guess is that they settled on 5500x3d because they were hitting high 90% yield for that chip and not much more for anything else.  The Zen3 is arrange in 2x4 for the cores, so they must be hitting high for 6 of 8 coming through and really, really low for all eight.  The difference between 5700x3d and 5800x3d binning is the later hits higher stable clocks.  The 5700x3d is just functionally a 5800x3d that's got a few issues so running it at lower clocks keeps it stable.  But the 5500x3d is two cores died during production.  So it might be hard for them to hit 8 for 8 enough times to bin 10% of the wafer into a 5700x3d SKU on the machine they have the 5500x3d on.  And the 5500 isn't being produced on the main money maker fabs, that's always the latest gen that it's tooled for.  So 6 for 8 is maybe as best this machine they're running on can do and 8 for 8 is pushing it too hard.  I don't know, depends on the location and what they've got going.  But to retool one of the big boys that have great batting averages to run an AM4 platform is silly talk.  It'd take a ton of time to do so and disrupt so much we'd have another disruptive chip stocking issue.  I don't know AMD's specific numbers, but I can only imagine that they'd need some high 8 for 8 yield for it to be equal in price to the current AM5.  There's likely a specific reason they selected the 5500x3d as 6 for 8 and at the price point they've put it at.  My guess is that they're getting high yields on the machine they're using for two busted cores, high enough that the 5500 can be at the price it's at and it make sense to keep an AM4 around still.  Again, if the DDR5 makes an issue for the 9000s and AMD actually cares about the consumer platform, then it's just easier to use some dollars to have some of the higher demand consumers for DDR5 to ease up a bit and let some flow into consumers.  A whole lot easier than trying to push a machine to justify binning the 5700 SKU.  And vastly easier than trying to retool one of the machines it used to be on, back to doing that platform.",pcmasterrace,2025-12-19 07:26:11,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.73095644), 'word': 'Zen3', 'start': 700, 'end': 704}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nuvcsfq,"Yeah, it really depends on the length of the ""DDR5 drama"" which that's what I'm going to call this now.  I've taken it, you can't stop me.  But the thing is, given what I've heard with folks like Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix, these aren't temporary changes, these are structural shifts in production.  *Money into data centers has crossed some sort of threshold that things like consumer PCs aren't profitable any more.  There just simply isn't enough sales in consumer PCs to justify the production before.*  Honestly, this gets into the economics part that I have very little knowledge on.  So, take anything I have to say in the above with a massive grain of salt.  But the main makers of DDR5 RAM are doing things that are big shifts away from the way it used to be done.  Reasons for why they're doing that I can only guess, but those may be bad guesses.  So the DDR5 drama may have a much longer duration.  I don't know, but the kinds of shifts they're doing aren't common.  But at the same time, it may mean a massive shift for the AM5 platform and software developers.  Chip makers issue a thing called ""Last Time To Buy"" LTBs.  The main producers of DDR4 have LTBs already.  The last ""raw"" DDR4 chips will be sold by major makers up to Dec. 31st.  After that, there's no more being made by the major makers.  But the big three aren't the only ones who make these.  There's Nanya, Winbond, and the Chinese CXMT.  They have yet to announce LTBs for their chips.  Again, I'm guessing here.  Just pulling shit out my ass here.  *But we all know how like Chinese CPUs are like a gen or two behind the leading gen?  I have a feeling that's going to be the entire consumer PC market.  Like what they're using in data centers is like two gens ahead of everyone else.  I think the DDR5 drama is just the correction to that state, but I have a sinking feeling, the situation that China has with their homegrown CPUs, will be what everyone who is a consumer will be in soon enough.*",pcmasterrace,2025-12-19 14:52:32,1,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87502384), 'word': 'DDR5', 'start': 46, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99719846), 'word': 'Micron', 'start': 196, 'end': 202}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9988451), 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 204, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9908001), 'word': 'SK Hynix', 'start': 217, 'end': 225}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9922517), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 693, 'end': 695}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9147813), 'word': 'DDR5', 'start': 869, 'end': 873}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93921727), 'word': 'Time To Buy', 'start': 1118, 'end': 1129}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83748484), 'word': 'DDR4', 'start': 1160, 'end': 1164}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8460452), 'word': 'DDR4', 'start': 1200, 'end': 1204}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84287894), 'word': 'Nanya', 'start': 1383, 'end': 1388}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9462984), 'word': 'Win', 'start': 1390, 'end': 1393}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9992118), 'word': 'Chinese', 'start': 1407, 'end': 1414}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9582494), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1415, 'end': 1416}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7054627), 'word': '##MT', 'start': 1417, 'end': 1419}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7854827), 'word': 'L', 'start': 1448, 'end': 1449}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9961661), 'word': 'Chinese', 'start': 1560, 'end': 1567}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.99949145), 'word': 'China', 'start': 1880, 'end': 1885}]",Tópico 1

Don't forget to remove any plastic on the cooler/CPU, the 4/8pin plug  on the mobo,  ensure you've got whatever the number of standoff are for your motherboard (6-8?), and that ram (ensure they are offset, e.g. slots 1/3 or 2/4), nvme and GPU are fully seated. DDR5 typically goes in one end first at a slight angle, and it can take a bit of pressure. Remember if you need to pull your GPU that there is a release on the far end of the slot. That's about all I can think of before my coffee - except it's good practice to ensure your bios is up to date (search the sevice section for your exact model), and of course set your RAM to XMP, or youre leaving a ton of performance on the table.

AMD,nvi9sxy,"> I'd rather not play a game than let it touch my kernel level.  Unfortunately, as someone who's played league for 15 years, that really isnt an option. I took a 5 year break, checked it out again last year and now i play regularly again. Not as much as i used to, i play a few games a day now as opposed to like 5-6 fron S1 to S9, so roughly half the playtime, but i have easily over 10k hrs in this game, likely closer to 15k. And i play ranked only, so since im not a casual i cant just ditch the game like that. Over the 5 yrs i played many other competitive games, i played cs go, fortnite, wow, rocket league, but none of em could scratch the itch. After coming back to league, i realized what i was missing. I was missing league. Theres just no other game out there that feels this good to play. Especially since im very good at it (I was Master in S8 which is like GM now due to inflation and cuz GM didnt exist back then). Turns out, being REALLY good at a game makes it 10x more fun when u're playing it competitively, who would have thought! Ofc, im not gonna be a pro player or anything like that, but it doesnt mean i cant feel satisfaction from my 3 ranked games a day and feel the pleasure of improving and watching my rank grow. None of the other games i played felt anywhere near as good. In cs go i got master guardian but thats kinda mid. In rocket league i saw the dudes flying and i was like, nah no way i can learn that without another 10k hours investment, same for dota. Fortnite no build was cool, i employed the hide in a cellar afk strategy and was able to reach Unreal, the highest rank, averaging 0.11 kills per game. I quit cuz it was boring and after watching pros like Prospering i realized this guy can do 40 kill games, aint no way i will ever be as good as him at this game. Wow was cool and i nearly got the 0.1% title in m+, fell barely short, was doin 14s and 15s as a tank. However, these 3 months were miserable, everything was a chore, its like u gotta wash the dishes and clean the toilet in a video game, dailies weeklies rep farm, alt chars grinding, raids and vault slots to rng the bis trinkets etc. And in the end it didnt even feel that good, honestly wow is such a slow paced game its kinda boring.

AMD,nvj61bm,"I think league is not different than the other games like Marvel Rivals. U feel amazing when u win (dopamine rush), and u feel terrible when u lose. Altho, in league it feels extra miserable. Like in cs or rivals, u can be 1v3 and u might just clutch it, even with a deagle u can get some good headshots and win the round. But in league, if ur teammates were feeding, well now that 1v3 is the enemies also having 2 items on top of u, meaning they are like a tank and u're like a kitten to them, making it impossible to win. So u lose and ur whole game experience is getting trashed around because someone else fed the enemies. Even when i came back to league and i initially didnt care about my rank cuz i was just relearning the game after 5 yrs of not playing, it felt sooo miserable to lose. I didnt care about my LP at all cuz i knew i was rusty as fuck, and it still felt so bad to lose cuz the entire experience that u spend there feels like u're locked in like a hostage or smth. And yeah i main jungle and get told to kill myself and flamed every game (with creative ways like talon E off a building cuz the chat punishments are unreal in 2025), but ive grown such thick skin over the years that it doesnt bother me at all anymore, but yeah definitely the most toxic of all the mainstream games, except maybe for dbd, tho in the last few yrs bhvr introduced anti camping and anti tunneling mechanics so its not that bad. But yeah asides from that league is really not as bad as people make it seem to be, my only big complaint is that people dont surrender early enough. Im in diamond so unlike low elo they do surrender a lot, but still not quite as much as they should, but i also mainly play late game scaling champs so it doesnt bother me as much cuz my teammates wanna keep me hostage by not surrendering (cuz they still think we can win, somehow) then good for me cuz if any1s gonna carry its gonna be me on my monster scaling champ, tho realistically once ure far behind its prob like 10% chance to win, not worth dragging a 20 min game out for another 10 mins to slowly suffocate to death. Enemies in diamond are good at ending games but not amazing like master+ are, so they generally manage to end but it takes a bit more time which makes it more frustrating cuz like they have a 12k gold lead, mess around a lil bit, give u 4k gold back but they still have 8k lead and and 3 drakes so they end anyway with baron/soul at like 30 mins. Basically the enemies throw just enough to give 2 of ur 4 teammates enough hope to press No in the surrender vote, but not enough to actually come back (usually). But yeah i wouldnt say league is a bad game, it teaches u patience and perseverence ESPECIALLY if u main jungle cuz every1 always blames u all the time. U learn quickly whose opinion and words to ignore and how to read people's emotional wellbeing. The jungler is the leader of the team and he's the one who makes the calls on the map, like calling ur support to roam to voidgrubs, telling ur mid laner to push and recall 30 secs before the spawn timer so he can arrive full hp to the fight and so on. If u play mechanically easy champs (so not leesin or nidalee) u can carry pretty much exclusively by using ur brain even if u dont have great hands (aka mechanics), u cant really do that in most other games, like i was great with nades and setups in cs go but my aim sucks so much i always lose a 1v1 fight even in gold, honestly amazing i got to master guardian like that.

I mean i could go jungle but id prob be flamed from the get go by the top laner (pos x, i forgot the number) since hed be 1v2, and from what i read jungling in dota 2 isnt even good at high level. I remember the patch, smth like 7.34? Or 7.14? Basically right after they nerfed that medusa character, they nerfed her ability so she cant jungle well. Its like every time a hero is good in the jungle at high level valve nerfs him so u have to play 2v2 in the top lane (or was it bot lane).

Like yeah top can go 0/5 but if i had ganked bot better they would be 5/0 and it would all equal out, but maybe my pathing was bad or my gank timing was a bit off so we didnt get kills bot and then they had a fed top and we had fuck all.

This was done primarily to test the Zen 4 compute dies (CCDs) and architecture using the existing, mature AM4 infrastructure before the AM5 platform was fully ready. * **The ""Hybrid"" Design:** To make this work, engineers likely paired the **Zen 4 CCDs** (5nm) with a compatible **Zen 3-era I/O die** (12nm) that supported DDR4 memory and the AM4 socket. * **Decision to Cancel:** Despite having functional 16-core Zen 4 samples on AM4, AMD chose not to bring them to market. They instead focused on the  **Ryzen 7 5800X3D**  as the final high-performance gaming upgrade for the AM4 platform because the 3D V-Cache provided a more significant gaming benefit on the older socket than a core-count increase."" * [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1NXHQ8YTA&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM1NXHQ8YTA&t=2s)",AMD,2025-12-19 16:59:27,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9889247), 'word': 'AMD Engineers', 'start': 230, 'end': 243}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.994581), 'word': 'AMD Engineers', 'start': 406, 'end': 419}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9758053), 'word': 'Gamers Nexus', 'start': 439, 'end': 451}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653625), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 455, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9779308), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 574, 'end': 577}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9604238), 'word': 'R', 'start': 622, 'end': 623}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70117575), 'word': '##zen 9', 'start': 624, 'end': 629}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.71433765), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 640, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9845873), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 721, 'end': 724}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77498597), 'word': 'AM4', 'start': 791, 'end': 794}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.94818413), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 821, 'end': 823}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97179747), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 927, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9877628), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 1008, 'end': 1010}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7484933), 'word': 'Zen 4', 'start': 1100, 'end': 1105}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66561276), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1117, 'end': 1119}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9969338), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1122, 'end': 1125}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95351064), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1192, 'end': 1193}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8109766), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 1194, 'end': 1199}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9005441), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1264, 'end': 1266}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9676086), 'word': '3D', 'start': 1289, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9913635), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1294, 'end': 1295}]",Tópico 4

Basically RAM doesn't scale as well as logic (the density improvement for making RAM on smaller node is not great) thus why you don't see companies making DRAM on 7nm.  So when if someone want to make RAM on 7nm, they need to design it first and do all of the testing and validation process and then potentially have a product that is a lot more expensive.

Only those with a 'F' suffix have the GPU disabled.  I.e. a Ryzen 5 7400 goes for 130€ (tax included, so about 120 USD without tax), which is more than enough for video playback. For 140€ you can get a Ryzen 5 8500G, which has a little less CPU power (like 5% less) but has a way more powerful integrated GPU. You can play most games on low settings on it, if it is an older game you can probably max it out no problem. It is about on par with a GTX 1050. So if your home theater should also function as an emulation machine for everything PS2 and older, even some PS3 era games, go for this CPU.  A dedicated GPU wouldn't be cheaper than about 100USD, so there is just no room to sell those if the cheapest CPU+GPU combo goes for 120USD.

AMD,nv6ucak,"I’m glad to see that I’m writing to curious people.   u/SeventyTimes_7    u/Ambitious-Ad8725    u/Sora_hishoku   I’ll simplify the discussion to make it more interesting and less technical/daunting.  CELL was conceptually the father of NVIDIA’s success.   For the first time, the focus was on specialized parallel computing, and the engineers at Sony, IBM, and Toshiba were visionary and extremely bold in pursuing that path.   They only made one mistake: such a CPU couldn’t function properly without adequate software support. That’s where NVIDIA came in and realized it needed to create CUDA for its GPUs, offering what CELL did, but with an easier language and an intuitive framework for programming.   Without CELL, history would have gone differently.   For me, preserving that CPU is like preserving a piece of computing history.  RDNA3, on the other hand, is one of the boldest, most audacious, and futuristic choices in the entire industry. It's the future today, where everything will be chiplet   It shifts towards horizontal development, not just vertical, even in the consumer sector. It allows interconnections between multiple chips with record bandwidths of over 5 terabytes per second, eliminating many bottlenecks that are inevitable with manufacturing nodes and monolithic chips.   This isn’t just a simple play; AMD has managed to overcome the latency barriers that are extremely severe on GPUs, unlike CPUs.  They also redesigned the Compute Units with FP32 SIMD, bringing intelligence inside the chip for the first time, not just size and raw power.   In magazines, you’ll read that the 7900XTX has 6,144 shader units, but that’s a partial figure it depends on the scheduler, the compiler, and how well the code is written.   6,144 represents the minimum, where each instruction is incompatible with another. In real practice, however, code often contains many compatible and similar instructions, so the count can theoretically reach up to 12,288, within reasonable limits.  The key detail is that, for the first time, the chip communicates with software at the lowest level, working in perfect harmony. If the compiler improves in the future, RDNA3 itself improves, because instructions per cycle are reordered and scheduled more efficiently, leveraging far more than the declared 6,144.   Other companies simply increase physical ALUs without addressing modularity and software-driven management.  RDNA3 has an extraordinary pipeline combining general purpose and specialized tasks, modularity in its Compute Units, and many other clever innovations.   Its display engine is phenomenal and still reigns supreme today.   It was a bold and risky choice, but an incredible engineering success.   They could have taken the easy route with a high-wattage monolithic chip, but instead, they pushed the limits physically and mathematically, creating an amazing chip for the consumer market.  It remains a prime example of the validity of the chiplet design, as the first consumer GPU in the world to use a chiplet.   It is capable of leading in performance and efficiency (350W) in theoretical computation following linear math principles.  I want to preserve these two pieces of engineering, as early examples of the future :)",AMD,2025-12-21 12:38:54,18,Positive,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94374406), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 236, 'end': 242}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99883515), 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 346, 'end': 350}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9988232), 'word': 'IBM', 'start': 352, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9707921), 'word': 'Toshiba', 'start': 361, 'end': 368}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.92712194), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 542, 'end': 548}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.46637517), 'word': 'C', 'start': 590, 'end': 591}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45566085), 'word': 'R', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.41247353), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 840, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99645066), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9591619), 'word': 'Co', 'start': 1455, 'end': 1457}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8338633), 'word': 'Units', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9574543), 'word': 'F', 'start': 1474, 'end': 1475}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nuve5ja,DDR6 isn't coming for years.  Earliest dates you can find are sometime in 2027.  And that is primarily for server use since the cost for it is supposed to be REAL high.  Its probably coming to desktop much later in 2028 or so and Intel will probably launch it first in PC just like they did pretty much DDR2 onwards (IIRC they actually supported RDRAM before DDR).  AMD also tends to delay adopting the latest memory standards by a year or more.  Been that way since before DDR3 came out so they're pretty consistent here.  If they follow that pattern again you won't see AMD requiring DDR6 support until sometime in 2029.  That is why rumors having been coming out that Zen7 will also be on AM5.  Either DDR6 won't be ready in time or AMD won't be ready with a new socket in time for Zen7.  Given the caches they're putting on their chips these days its not like it matters much anyways what RAM they use past a certain point.  You can get more benefit from cranking the IF bus and improving latency then going high bandwidth on AM5 anyways.  And that is for the non-X3D chips.  The X3D chips care even less about main system bandwidth.    Where it would matter is for a high(er) performance iGPU but everyone seems to be going for soldered RAM of some sort with those anyways so its of questionable benefit any which way you look at it for AM5's expected lifespan.,AMD,2025-12-19 14:59:54,12,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6865744), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975441), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 230, 'end': 235}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.61034733), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 303, 'end': 305}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.885139), 'word': 'IIRC', 'start': 317, 'end': 321}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.89355314), 'word': 'R', 'start': 346, 'end': 347}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95814407), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 366, 'end': 369}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.73372245), 'word': 'DDR3', 'start': 474, 'end': 478}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9334179), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 572, 'end': 574}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8975421), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 586, 'end': 588}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.668583), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 671, 'end': 675}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9200418), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 705, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9417684), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 736, 'end': 739}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.74806637), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 785, 'end': 788}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.57763493), 'word': '##3', 'start': 1069, 'end': 1070}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6534968), 'word': '##3', 'start': 1085, 'end': 1086}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6022981), 'word': 'i', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1194}]",Tópico 1

How AMD managed to raise the price, if it was with slowing down the production, leading to decreased supply or with just selling it for more is kind of irrelevant in this context, as we're just interested in price. The point is that they can do the same here, making 9850x3d artificially more compelling product by simply raising the price of 9800x3d just before 9850x3d launches.    The price of 7800x3d reached an all time high just about when the 9800x3d was released. I don't think that's a coincidence. Looking at price history in December 2024 when the 9800x3d was barely available the price of 7800x3d went back to it's original launch price (at least here in Sweden) with the price creeping up since August of 2024.

There's quite a few issues around the ring timeout issue.   New Kernels and Mesa drivers haven't seemed to fix it yet, although they do often help people in some cases like here: [https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13713](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13713)  The issues still exist for a lot of people and there does not seem to be a universal fix.   Usually just turning down the settings and or restricting the power target can help, but again, it's not a perfect solution. Something seems to just let the card run away with power or memory usage until it crashes. The same games on Windows work fine. Sometimes AMD's VLK drivers work better over Mesa's, but I think it's more likely a kernel thing given that's what's interfacing with the hardware and reporting its capabilities back to the rest of the system.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.

AMD,nvbb6wv,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.

AMD,nt12wk5,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.

AMD,ntz1is6,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Intel,2025-12-14 13:04:59,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985821), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 589, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9987382), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 638, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9978817), 'word': 'Final Fantasy XI', 'start': 807, 'end': 823}]",Tópico 3

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Intel,2025-07-24 18:00:40,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985837), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 59, 'end': 64}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.77491397), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 102, 'end': 106}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983492), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 112, 'end': 117}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88058984), 'word': 'Zen 6', 'start': 199, 'end': 204}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.764349), 'word': 'N', 'start': 255, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98639184), 'word': 'Zen 6', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995409), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 338, 'end': 341}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.92360795), 'word': 'TSM', 'start': 359, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98477644), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 377, 'end': 381}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.992616), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 527, 'end': 531}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99872535), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 723, 'end': 728}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9965333), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 733, 'end': 736}]",Tópico 4

Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides.
