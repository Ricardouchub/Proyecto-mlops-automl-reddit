We're talking about the B390. The one Intel is using in its presentations. None of your examples are B390. The article is about the B-series. We shouldn't use the B390's performance numbers to compare to Strix Point, but only use the prices of the non B-series.

You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",hardware,2026-01-14 16:13:54,-1,Negative,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.989419), 'word': 'GN', 'start': 468, 'end': 470}]",Tópico 4

Intel,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",hardware,2026-01-13 15:59:39,-4,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76293916), 'word': 'B31', 'start': 18, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7452721), 'word': 'A31', 'start': 76, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7529128), 'word': 'Al', 'start': 91, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9379297), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 194, 'end': 200}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9643023), 'word': 'GTX 1650', 'start': 383, 'end': 391}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88162076), 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 520, 'end': 529}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99752444), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 596, 'end': 601}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7194058), 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 617, 'end': 627}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.55869925), 'word': 'Celes', 'start': 632, 'end': 637}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7116459), 'word': '##tial', 'start': 637, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76397717), 'word': 'A31', 'start': 772, 'end': 775}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9997087), 'word': 'Australia', 'start': 829, 'end': 838}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9302061), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1243}]",Tópico 4

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

Intel,nywgma9,"QC last year had a bad product.  It was competitive vs AMD and Intel but Qc was selling those for 50% less than Intel or AMD chips. OEMs at first decided to price these at Intel prices then it settled at Intel -100/200€   QC laptops still sold what QC and partners expected and OEMs are increasing new models for X2 (design wins went from 60 to 100+)   X2 has a 25% advantage vs Panther Lake and it will still be cheaper because QC is an underdog. If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029.

Intel,ny0aepy,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant.

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

For the games you said like Fortnite, CS, and newer shooters, you want high FPS and smooth gameplay, not just pretty graphics, so you don’t need some insane $3000 monster build.  If you were going closer to the lower end around 1000, I’d probably recommend something like a Ryzen 5 7600 for the CPU, an RTX 4060 or RX 7600 for the graphics card, 16GB or ideally 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD like a Samsung 980 or WD SN770, a B650 motherboard, a 650 watt power supply from Corsair or EVGA, and just a normal airflow case like a Phanteks or NZXT H5 Flow. That kind of build would absolutely destroy esports games at 1080p and still run most modern games really well. It’s basically the “I just switched from console and want something way better but not crazy expensive” build.  If you land in the middle around like 1200 to 1500 which honestly is the smartest range right now, I’d move to something like a Ryzen 7 7700, then pair that with an RTX 4070 or RX 7800 XT. Keep 32GB DDR5 RAM, still 1TB or 2TB NVMe SSD, same B650, a 750 watt good quality power supply, and a decent air cooler or 240mm AIO.

Intel,o5gzw24,"Yo gotta find everything by yourself, there is too much things to say. When i built my first pc 6month ago, i knew nothing about pc building, i went on a quest to gather every infos on youtube channels and reddit previous reddit post, and after 2month i m fully up to date.  Now is a bad time to build a pc by yourself, as the ram price has skyrocketted, so are the ssd and now gpu.  32Go of ddr5 ram (the last version of ram if you prefer) is now 450USD. So you probably want to buy a prebuild pc or see if anyone is selling an am4 one.  (am5=ddr5=most recent cpu can fit in) (am4=ddr4=previous generation)  With 1k/1k5 you can do a mid range/budget build (depends if you include peripherals in the budget). You ll just have to preoritize fps/dollar value, so go check what fits you the most by going to search for benchmarks on a specific gpu/cpu, also search for the best cpu/gpu combos, you ll eventually get them after some search.  If i can give you some advice for your futur builds, here are some : - When you are done, put your build on pc part picker and see the voltage you need, always take a psu that can handle more than your max voltage (ex: max V=650, take 700/750 or even higher) - Never cheap on screens, i was about to do so for my first build, but in was x10 times worth buying a 240fps oled 2k than the same one in ips, even for 2 or 3 time the price, the value you get from a good screen (especially oled) is so much worth compare to juste getting few more fps (depending on your budget for sure) - Always check compatibilty and lenght of your compenents, don t buy compenents that end up not fiting with your other compenents  If i can advice some channels, i often watch LinuxTechTips, wich do a lot of nerdy reparation stuff, pretty cool to know more about pc building. ZZT is also a great channel for beginners, he vulgarize a lot of things, i started with him, but there is plenty more channel.  Good luck !

The 3080 has DLSS though, so unless you like tinkering and don't mind using Optiscaler, then the 3080 is overall better. The only downside is its 10GB of VRAM. I had a 7800XT just a couple months ago, and FSR 4 worked great through Optiscaler. Basically any game with DLSS or FSR support (any version), you can get FSR 4 to work. It's like four steps and you're good to go. It's the INT 8 version (unofficial), but the image quality is close to the same as the official FP8 FSR 4.  If you want to keep your RAM (which I don't think is too little for just gaming right now, and you can always get another 2x8 kit), then your best bet for a CPU upgrade would be something like a 14600K or 14700K. I would stay away from the 14900K just because of the degradation issues they've had, which seems to be extra bad for the 14900K  Although, your 10900K is only about 20-30% slower than a 14600K at 1080p from what I can gather, which isn't really that limiting at 1440p. If you don't mind switching platform altogether, I'd get a 7800X3D and 32GB of DDR5. Personally, I don't think the 8% uplift for a 9800X3D is worth the ~$40-50 premium.  If I were you I'd probably get a 9070 XT or 5070 Ti and a 2x8 kit of DDR4 and call it a day. Maybe a new mobo and a 14600K as well if you feel like the CPU is hampering you. You should be able to find an LGA1700 motherboard and a 14600KF for ~$350, which is a little under the price for just a 7800X3D by itself. KF btw means it's a 14600K without integrated graphics.

If anything CPU might get you more bang for your buck with the 1060 not being that bad but it also requires a new mobo and potentially a new PSU depending on what you choose.   When you start looking at it like that honestly it might be worth your while to check out some modern prebuilts with modern parts that’ll game on the “low end” of gaming specs. I put the quotation marks because the low end of modern parts is still very good for 1080p gaming and a bit uplift from where you’re at. Again though - not sure what your budget is like just some food for thought. Right now prebuilts are better prices than part buying for a PC.  If you’re dead set on only a couple parts I think you should start at CPU/mobo. Be careful where you land though if you get the most recent gens of CPUs you’ll need DDR5 ram which is an expensive af market.

Intel,o35ui6v,"Hello :) Intel Arc isn’t the same as Iris Xe. Arc is newer, and it’s usually noticeably better for graphics.  Out of these three, I’d pick the **HP ProBook (Core Ultra + Arc)**, it’s the most “future proof” option, and ProBooks are generally better built. About the HP hinge issue, it’s mostly a problem on some cheaper consumer models, it can still happen, but ProBooks are usually a safer bet.

Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds?

Intel,o0v4u9k,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.

Intel,nyko7q2,"Yeah, and AMD says Strix Halo has four channels in their customer facing spec as well, because they have 128b and 256b buses respectively. They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Intel,nymut0x,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So I bought a 14900k and that wouldn't boot even with the latest bios. I had an Auros Z790 elite AX motherboard with 96gb Corsair vengeance 5200mhz DDR5 ram, and RTX 4090. So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now. When I press shut down, my screens turn off and it seems like it's off, but my fans and light and everything else are still running. So I have to hold the power button to shut it down.   I am suspicious of my PSU because I think it could cause some of these issues, but I've had this PSU only since 2023 and it's a Corsair HX1000i.   The only things I kept from my old build were the PSU, GPU, and ram. And considering both systems were having issues, it makes sense that maybe one of them is acting up. But I don't really know if that explains all the problems I've been having.

Intel,o4oyoi2,"​Hi everyone, ​I'm having a frustrating issue with AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition. ​I have a Ryzen 7 7700X and a Sapphire MBA 7900 XTX. I've set my PBO limits and a thermal limit of 85°C in the BIOS (MSI motherboard). Everything works fine until I undervolt my GPU via Adrenalin. ​The moment I apply GPU settings, the software automatically toggles the CPU section to ""Custom/Overclock"" and locks the voltage around 1.3V - 1.35V. This completely ignores my BIOS PBO limits and thermal throttle settings. As a result, while my GPU stays cool, my CPU starts hitting 90°C+ in mostly every game, even though it should be capped. ​The worst part is: if I hit ""Reset to Default"" in Adrenalin to stop the CPU madness, it also resets my EXPO profile, dropping my RAM speed from 6000MHz to 4800MHz. ​Summary of the mess: ​GPU Undervolt active = CPU overheating (Software overrides BIOS PBO). ​Resetting Adrenalin = RAM speed drops to 4800MHz. ​MSI Center is not active/uninstalled. ​How can I force Adrenalin to STOP touching my CPU/RAM settings while keeping my GPU undervolt active? Is there a way to lock the CPU tuning part of the software? ​Any help is appreciated before I lose my mind.",AMD,2026-02-10 21:55:32,1,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5244444), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 51, 'end': 53}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.39629605), 'word': '##D', 'start': 53, 'end': 54}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5647663), 'word': 'Software', 'start': 55, 'end': 63}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6423704), 'word': 'R', 'start': 94, 'end': 95}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6635534), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 96, 'end': 101}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.996958), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 114, 'end': 116}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.68985397), 'word': '##pphire MBA', 'start': 116, 'end': 126}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7473809), 'word': 'MS', 'start': 201, 'end': 203}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5005611), 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 270, 'end': 272}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50524384), 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 677, 'end': 679}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6720662), 'word': '##lin', 'start': 683, 'end': 686}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6526671), 'word': 'E', 'start': 730, 'end': 731}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5033653), 'word': '##PO', 'start': 732, 'end': 734}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47762135), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 814, 'end': 816}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83320636), 'word': 'MSI Center', 'start': 936, 'end': 946}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7002365), 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 991, 'end': 993}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.63631725), 'word': '##lin', 'start': 997, 'end': 1000}]",Tópico 3

Intel,o14ytde,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.

Intel,o16r403,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.

Intel,o46e0sj,"First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to listen/read and look into this, I appreciate it greatly. I'm not sure why, but it seems your reply about the issue possibly being related to ISR isn't showing up on here for some reason. Could just be the site being dumb.  So, the audio differences I'm hearing aren't related to functionality, or the ability to playback audio without interrupts (dropouts, clicking, popping, choppiness). That has been flawless, for me, which is great. I'm referring to audio fidelity differences between drivers.  For instance, I uninstalled the driver I've recently been testing (25.12.1) via DDU and listened to some music with just the Microsoft display adapter being used as the driver. The audio sounded pretty normal again, and what I would consider correct/good. I then ran windows update, and it thankfully installed the 32.0.21030.2001 driver. Listened to some music, and as I heard before, it's still the best sounding driver I've used. The only other driver I've used that comes close is 25.1.1. That one has some slight issues with audio fidelity and image quality, but it was close enough to correct at the time.   The only thing I can think of that sounds similar and would describe what I'm hearing with these newer drivers is when you have a bit-depth and sampling rate mismatch between your music and output device. I have my audio devices set to 16/44.1 in windows, but with these newer drivers (25.9.1-25.12.1), the audio sounds as if the bit depth and sampling rate are set to higher values, even though they aren't. It's extremely strange, and sort of difficult to explain, but that's what I'm hearing.   The frustrating and unfortunate reality that might be coming into play here, is that differences could also vary between systems. So, a bad sounding driver on my system (25.9.1), might possibly sound fine or even good on a different system with different components.  It could also be caused by or related to interactions between code or the registry entries of different programs on the system interacting with drivers, but that's above my level of understanding. I'm just a dude who is noticing stuff (audio & video) and would like others who are smarter and more skilled to look into why there are differences in the first place and what could potentially be causing them.    By the way, you guys have been doing a great job with the video/image quality of these recent drivers. They are substantially better and closer to reference than everything previously released. 25.9.1 and 25.11.1 are the best drivers I've tested/used, in regards to video & image quality.",AMD,2026-02-08 01:11:28,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96877897), 'word': 'ISR', 'start': 194, 'end': 197}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9401379), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 677, 'end': 686}]",Tópico 3

Intel,o4hted2,"Ah gotcha. To be fair, I would say the differences between these more recent drivers are much smaller now compared to the drivers released in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Especially trying each driver from 25.9.1 to 25.12.1, specifically the audio, seems to get better with each release. It seems the team, or someone, also heard what I did with the 25.9.1 driver and tried to fix/improve it with each subsequent driver release.   I haven't tried 26.1.1 yet, but I will to test and compare. I'll also install LatencyMon to see if there is a correlation between good/bad audio and latency.  It really seems like the team that handles the display/video side of the drivers has mostly corrected the issues that were present with the old drivers (video output format/range, luminance levels, gamma curve, sharpness, white point, grayscale & color accuracy). There are still differences, but I wouldn't get too worried about it.  The oddball out of the bunch is 25.8.1. The audio is actually pretty good, but different. Sounds as if there is a surround sound effect turned on, or the audio output format is surround sound instead of stereo. It works really well for gaming, but music sounds a little strange. Due to the overall frequency response balance, it's honestly not bad. If it wasn't for the video/image quality side of things, I would probably use that driver.   On the video side, I think there is something wrong with the gamma curve and color. The gamma curve tracks higher (darker) in the lower luminance range. The white point and grayscale are more blue than neutral gray, and the overall color saturation is reduced, as if the color gamut clamp in the adrenaline software is being used. I checked to see if this was the case with my colorimeter, but the color gamut is normal for my monitor, so the actual color volume isn't being reduced.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware?

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9604742), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393346), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7001686), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 4

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682612), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658414), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568305), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114903), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8751363), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80407614), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83806515), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147056), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005272), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6974834), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5886638), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113516), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741815), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076934), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363589), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA.

While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards). Hopefully subscription-free model can make Nvidia a run for its money, at least in entry VDI solutions that Nvidia has no interest in.",AMD,2024-04-01 23:20:26,9,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99291867), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 0, 'end': 3}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6843471), 'word': 'V', 'start': 20, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87287146), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 94, 'end': 96}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83501613), 'word': 'I', 'start': 97, 'end': 98}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87435293), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 128, 'end': 134}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99794096), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 139, 'end': 144}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983935), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 155, 'end': 160}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8084253), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 332, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8263099), 'word': 'S7', 'start': 363, 'end': 365}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9402525), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 411, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82452023), 'word': 'Nvidia Grid', 'start': 565, 'end': 576}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.3719376), 'word': 'G', 'start': 800, 'end': 801}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71034974), 'word': '##F', 'start': 802, 'end': 803}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5598253), 'word': 'Now', 'start': 808, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982741), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 815, 'end': 820}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9681562), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 852, 'end': 857}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.46824238), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91127616), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1011, 'end': 1014}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9926388), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1073, 'end': 1078}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.49209762), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1268, 'end': 1269}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8492522), 'word': 'GPU F', 'start': 1284, 'end': 1289}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9292618), 'word': 'Al', 'start': 1308, 'end': 1310}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.45835584), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 1323, 'end': 1325}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5665539), 'word': 'I', 'start': 1326, 'end': 1327}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.881304), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1419, 'end': 1425}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515014), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1484, 'end': 1490}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.

Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

If you brought 2022 Intel socket, to enjoy latest, you need either LGA 1851 (Ultra 2) or wait for Ultra 4 (LGA 1954).

I don't care if you don't actually overclock or upgrade the CPU. Intel non-OC chipsets are still more expensive than AMD OC chipsets and buyers clearly like having the option of OC/dropping in a new CPU even if they never actually do it.

AMD,o46ncfh,"To be fair, AMD's strategy is because they're used in consoles. Every technical decision they've made has been dictated by the cost constraints of developing console hardware. What you get in the desktop was paid for by the console manufacturers and it is as powerful and feature-packed as the console manufacturers were willing to pay.   What I mean is, AMD's strategy with RT was meant to be cheap because it's the way Sony and MS got to have the tech while also not having spiraling hardware costs. Rdna2 is basically the tech those consoles got scaled up and rDNA 3 was rdna 2+.   Rdna4 was basically a rehash of what Sony paid for the ps5 pro. And rdna5 is likely going to be a beef up version of whatever the console manufacturers pay for the 2027 season.    AMD doesn't have anywhere near the r&d money nvidia has and it doesn't have the deep pockets Intel has to throw money to a hard problem until they crack it.   I'm going to be the first to complain about their lack of software strategy, but their hardware strategy makes sense when you consider they get a tenth of the market share nvidia gets and for the longest time had revenue much smaller than Intel's and Nvidia's. They make the best use of the tech MS and Sony pay for their consoles.    Maybe this time they will use that sweet sweet AI money to flesh out their hardware, but I'm not holding my breath.

AMD,o437sd5,"Native is not a magic resolution where everything is correct. This is a statement people keep making that sounds correct if you don't think about it, but it's just flatly wrong.      Tons of geometry and textures have detail that can be smaller than a pixel in games today. The vast majority of effects and basically all the lighting (whether ray traced or not) is initially rendered at lower than native resolution.  TAA is already used in basically every game because of how common deferred rendering is. If TAA weren't used, the flickering and aliasing would be so intense it would make games unplayably bad.    Even if none of that were true, the idea of native being ""correct"" makes no sense. We would have had no need then for antialiasing techniques like SSAA or MSAA.    DLSS and all upscaling techniques today are a form of super sampling. It's just that they trade off spatial resolution and do the super sampling temporally. Using data from past frames is obviously worse than just rendering at a higher resolution in a vacuum. But you need cheap anti aliasing that covers everything anyway. And basically every game needs temporal accumulation (to run effects at sub-native resolution) in order to run fast enough with good enough visual quality anyway. And if you really can create an algorithm that effectively reuses data from past frames, then it can both look better and run faster than native.    Now could there be edge cases where something looks worse? Sure. All you need to do is look at FSR2/3 to see how worse algorithms make a ton more tradeoffs. But with good techniques, there will also be many situations where it can look better.    And if you truly care about quality above all else, then you can turn up graphical settings when introducing some upscaling. You'd have to compare something like ""Native"" with Low settings to DLSS with Medium or High settings (turning up the most impactful graphical settings until the framerate was the same).    Personally, at 4K output,  DLSS is always worth turning on.

AMD,o43gs9y,"In 2020, during the RTX 3000 series launch, Nvidia tried to control HU's videos because HU ""did not focus enough"" on DLSS. I believe it was either by refusing to send FE cards, or directly by telling them what to write? Not sure anymore, but after a public outcry and support from LTT, GN, and other outlets, Nvidia reversed their course.  Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Only around the Radeon RX 9000 series release did HU balance their coverage. I believe this was because both companies, AMD and Nvidia, had done so much anti-consumer shit by that point, that the public hated them (almost) equally.  Before this launch, the Reddit majority opinion was ""AMD has shittier drivers, but GPUs are much better value, and we can handle worse FSR for the price difference, also they are much better for Linux and fuck Nvidia for many valid reasons"". After the launch, Nvidia invested into Linux drivers (but had Windows driver issues of their own), AMD did the same shit with pricing, and DLSS pulled away far enough from FSR that the difference became too difficult to ignore.

After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  I mean that's a fair attitude no? People might disagree with it, but that's not evidence of bias, it's just an opinion on the value of RT.

Not focussing lots of benchmarking RT for the perhaps 5 games where it is worth it does make sense.  >Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Since DLSS 2 (1 was awful), they've always said DLSS was better than FSR. At times FSR wasn't that far behind DLSS, and when AMD cards were a fair bit cheaper it might be been worth it for some.

I find that extremely unlikely.  Also 50 series is a joke. It's glorified 30 series RT with low hanging fruits and low effort design in the form of OMM+SER+LSS, L2 and quadrupled ray/tri rate. No serious attempt to tackle the bottlenecks. Beating it will be easy.    For someone who actually bothered look at what Imagination latest designs achieved and imagine what scaling that up to dGPU power would do. Lot of AMD's latest design philosophy in their patent filings align with this (not surprising given their RT HW lead is from that company) so it's more likely than not that RDNA 5 will completely annihilate 50 series in RT traversal perf.

AMD,o4zug8e,Well am not gonna write you elaborate 😅 so I will try to explain what I ment by gains in simple words! 😏   Look when I said about latency test in PYPrime 2b this test measures how fast Memory exchange data with CPU so theoretically faster ram 6400+ should give you faster data transfer but unfortunately UDIMM's with higher clocks are losing timings and while you do that you're latency growing so as example I use standard EXPO 6000c30/38/38/96 and in AIDA Latency test it get 75.3ns and after all my tuning on my old R7 7700 I get 57.6ns almost 20ns fastery Ram exchanged data with CPU and because of this I get uplift in games especially in 1% Low but Biggest gains I felt and feel is in System Responsiveness like apps like browser file explorer and other apps like these started opening immediately! You click and app is open and ready to go + feeling of mouse how smooth suddenly become! Even likes of Steam opening visible quicker!    But having 9800x3D gives you uplift because of extra 64mb cache and this cache too exchanging data with memory so when your extra cache can exchange data faster you get more performance all for free!!

Part of that might be corporate culture, part of it might just be that Nvidia's 90% of the gaming market, part of it is just gaming adapting to the hardware the market provides (if you're a AAA game dev now or developing any sort of technically ambitious feature, you are building your engine/game from the ground up with features like RT/PT/DLSS/Framegen/NRC whatever else from the ground up- future cards are going to have insane matrix math capabilities to support AI, so we take our current gaming computation problems and turn them into matrix math problems- that's just the general hardware market shaping gaming tech).

AMD,o4gb8f3,"The whole ""NVIDIA doesn't care about gaming"" idea has always been absolute bullshit. Obviously no massive corporation ""cares"" in the way we humans might care about something, that is a given. But the idea that NV is somehow *uniquely disdainful* of gamers is childish and facile, and has no basis in observable fact.   If anything, it's the opposite: as someone who has been a PC gaming enthusiast for decades, I think NV has actually done more for me in that position than any other company (except, perhaps, Valve). Obviously they do so for business reasons; but the way they decide to act has been frequently beneficial to PC gaming.  As one massive (for me) example, I remember the first post-CRT decade in the monitor market where 60 Hz was just seen as **the** standard, and that was basically it. Which was very bleak from an action gaming perspective. And what really started to change that whole trajectory was the introduction of G-Sync -- not so much just the technology itself but more so getting the whole stagnant monitor industry to see the value of creating gaming-focused products.",hardware,2026-02-09 16:09:35,41,Neutral,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95250416), 'word': 'N', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.30452913), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 12, 'end': 14}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82772505), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 14, 'end': 17}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.65599316), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9526798), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 377, 'end': 379}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69412696), 'word': 'NV', 'start': 419, 'end': 421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9907094), 'word': 'Valve', 'start': 510, 'end': 515}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9501052), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 626, 'end': 628}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97783375), 'word': 'G', 'start': 940, 'end': 941}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9762014), 'word': 'S', 'start': 942, 'end': 943}]",Tópico 4

High performing matrix cores were probably a requirement for a high quality temporal upscaler and RT denoiser as well.

So, intead of trees with leaves and branches, you got this clumpy malformation of trees with a bunch of green colors that were supposed to be leaves that looked like something from 10 years prior. The upscaler also wasn't great as Nvidia was trying to make the tensor cores do too many things at once.  DLSS2 was where Nvidia turned the corner. That actually started with shader-based DLSS 1.9 that debuted in Control. This moved to a generalized training algorithm based on temporal multi-frame accumulation (TAA-based). Image softness and ghosting were still issues though, so AMD's contrast adaptive sharpening often provided better results when combined with a basic upscaler.  DLSS3/4/4.5 continued improving upscaler algorithms and models to where we are today. It took years to get to this point because missing pixel information was an issue when upscaling images.

To be fair to Nvidia, the segmentation wasn't necessarily ""needless"" once you know the history and origin of G-Sync.

Neither of these features existed in mainline DisplayPort at the time VESA had no intention of doing so.  It took nearly **2 years** after G-Sync was announced for VESA to announce their implementation into the DP1.2a spec and still more time after that because the LFC logic had to be built into the GPU (1st Gen G-Sync actually had LFC built-in to the custom ARM SBC they were using as the Display Controller+TCON).

Let's not forget that a lot of the ""generic VRR"" monitors also several other issues that were unrelated to overdrive. For example a lot of them had a really, really narrow update frequency where VRR actually worked. With G-Sync it did not matter what your refresh was, it would also be VRR and smooth. It accomplished this by various techniques like doubling frames at the really low refresh rates.   With a lot of the early FreeSync monitors, we had monitors that would only enable VRR at specific update frequencies, like maybe 48-75 Hz and as soon as you had higher or lower FPS than that, VRR would get disabled.

AMD,o5q1sl8,The writing's been firmly plastered on the wall in terms of unified architecture supremacy since the apple silicon M1 came out and they started busting down the door with more memory channels in consumer computers. There is just too much to gain from unifying everything. All the memory bandwidth you can cram in can benefit both the CPU and the GPU (and anything else that's in there). Maybe we'll get another round or two of viable traditional PC architecture but I think it's possible even for the next iteration of strix halo (medusa halo) to render all but top end gaming obsolete.  Even a 5090 which is difficult to even find a way to closely fully utilize from most gaming software in existence (due to being optimized for more modest hardware) is a baby next to the training and inference optimized nvidia hardware now... I look forward to good healthy competition between intel/nvidia APUs and AMD APUs. Surely some design will be forthcoming that can give good PCIe bandwidth to connect a top end discrete GPU and it will be a nice compact workstation powerhouse platform.

Their P+E Cores, while being a workable compromise-solution for the interim born out of necessity (which was initially supposed for helping them out of their ever self-inflicted process-woes), they have been done awfully bad in the fields with P+E in general.  It has been a really crappy job so far and Intel totally delivered a capital blunderbuss basically all along the way. And the worst part wasn't even, that the whole thing was mainly driven by sheer panic and pure desperation of Intel's own management — The absolute worst was that anything P+E is again another Intel-product, which was severely crippled already ahead of start …  That's when their unsound marketing, as it's usually the case, was rushing way ahead before engineering and, like *always*, were already frantically beating the drum on anything of their new *Hybrid&nbsp;Architecture* left, right and center — Like Intel was about to bring users with their P+E Cores into the Promised Land themselves …  *At a time, when Intel's* ***own*** *engineers in the background haven't even really figured out the whole thing in its entirety, and what it should or could look like in practice!*  ---- While their oh so original approach of a mere copycat of ARM's hugely successful big.LITTLE-paradigm (gone horribly wrong on Intel's end at that) *could've had* (engineering-wise) ***potentially*** *been a fairly reasonable stop-gap solution* at least in theory (if it had been executed any good). In practice, Intel completely dropped the solder-ball on every corner of their P+E Cores and threw a awfully half-baked, plain indefensible botched-up work onto the market and towards the end-users (especially software-wise), inflicting heavy scheduling-issues and came with tons of other problems along with it …  Non-working copy-protection breaking games, incredibly high latency-issues for anything audio-processing, HUGELY increased performance-penalties for any virtualization (context-switch penalties), heavy slow-downs in file-operations (every `SysCall` crippling the system) and whatnot.  I mean, we get it: Their P+E Core Hybrid&nbsp;Architecture was initially supposed to cover for their infamous 10nm™ process-woes, and for being able to compete with AMD's proclaimed ~~Corean War~~ *War on Cores*™ by cramping a reasonably enough amount of cores (or as many as possible) onto a package to compete in the market, but Intel's chaotic execution over the whole thing was abysmal and the end-products just horrible.

AMD,o4w7qll,"I was just in your exact situation, but with an i5 10400F.  The thought process was that it wasn’t gonna be for a serious gaming build, but I want to get the best parts I can use for the rig until the end of its life while spending the least amount of money.  This is most especially considering the upgrade cost to DDR5, and the mobo I use can only take until 11th gen max.  I ended up scoring a used i5 11500 for 70USD, which let me keep my B560 motherboard.  Since the 10400F also didn’t have PCIe 4.0 lanes, the move to 11500 will enable the first M.2 slot on my mobo and allow me to use my Gen 4 SSD at intended speeds.  So whilst the “best” would have been to move to AM4 and 5600X/5700X3D, it would have probably cost me triple or quadruple of what I spent now, which I didn’t find worth it for my use case, so I ended up just getting the best CPU I could find for my mobo.  I would have gone with a 11700 or 11900 but those seem like unicorns where I am.  Super happy with my upgrade and bonus on getting (inadvertently) an igpu along the way.

I guessed that Microcenter would charge him $2000. You gotta remember this is a retail chain giant that's going to give consumer sticker prices for their customers.   If you really want to get the \*best\* prices, the best option is to do your homework and purchase the correct parts separately and assemble the entire machine yourself. It seems daunting at first, but later on down the line you will be \*extremely grateful\* that you took the time to learn about these things before taking the plunge and making such a purchase.   Remind yourself that this machine is probably going to be your 'baby' for the next 2-3 years at least (assuming nothing crazy happens to it). So you wanna make sure your device is something you can live with for that long.   With that being said, the user that replied here wasn't wrong in stating that $1700 is still kind of an exorbitant price for what you're getting. The processor only has 8 cores / 16 threads, you only got 32GB RAM & just 1TB SSD. That's what makes me question the cost effectiveness of the setup you got. But I'm skeptical about whether you'll find something better AT Microcenter. You might have to go online or perhaps just buy certain components there at Microcenter and get the rest online.   At the very least, you should do a price comparison between whatever Microcenter is charging for a given component and what you can find it going for online.

AMD,o43r56z,"Haven't watched the video, but in AMD's defense. Smaller native floating point makes such a big difference in performance, quality and such a different beast to tune that it doesn't really make sense for AMD to invest in FSR yet.  FSR4 requires FP8, which is only natively supported by RDNA4. Nvidia already showed that FP4 gives you double the ai performance for visually the same quality as FP8. From a technical stance, the a lot of work the software radeon team will have to tune FP8 FSR4 will have to be redone whenever Radeon supports FP4 natively.  While it sucks that we don't get FSR4 on rdna 2 or 3, AMD themselves aren't willing to place a dead-end int8 version under the same label as their current stepping stone. Integer and floating point are different enough that optimizations in 1 don't translate to the other a lot of the time.  They also have to communicate with the hardware team to decide what is and isn't a viable development route. Tensor cores are essential for running transformer based upscaling. The hardware team not developing tensor cores held radeon back from developing transformer based FSR (FSR4) sooner. While Nvidia put tensor cores in their gpus since 2018 RTX. AMD only started with 2025 RDNA4, so AMD is playing 7 years of catch up. Even the first Intel Arc cards from 2022 had tensor cores.",AMD,2026-02-07 16:38:19,-1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9942106), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 34, 'end': 37}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99448466), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 204, 'end': 207}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.3724005), 'word': 'F', 'start': 221, 'end': 222}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56713235), 'word': 'F', 'start': 231, 'end': 232}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4736705), 'word': 'R', 'start': 286, 'end': 287}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97780347), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 293, 'end': 299}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99101114), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 525, 'end': 527}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91418326), 'word': '##on', 'start': 529, 'end': 531}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5784669), 'word': 'F', 'start': 541, 'end': 542}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6972517), 'word': 'F', 'start': 589, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9907942), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 610, 'end': 613}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5720576), 'word': 'F', 'start': 1122, 'end': 1123}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96958184), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1147, 'end': 1153}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936838), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1204}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99485815), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1238, 'end': 1241}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9147451), 'word': 'Intel Arc', 'start': 1289, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 2

AMD,o44042j,"I think Tim is missing the point a little here. AMD has opted (finally, and rightfully) to follow Nvidias example where it comes to their perception in the market.   Let me elaborate. Nvidia releases a software feature that doesn't work on the previous generation of GPU’s. Why do they do this? Is it because it simply wouldn’t work? Or because they just want to screw their customers with older cards? Or because they want to encourage sales of the new GPU? Maybe all 3, who knows.   But one reason that I find is often overlooked is that Nvidia knows and cares tremendously about brand perception. They learned that with the first version of DLSS. They were a laughing stock for a year because of how shit it was.  So Nvidia will not put out software for GPU’s unless it meets a certain quality standard. Now look at DLSS. The brand perception is so well regarded because they lock it down to only the cards it works well on.  To circle back, I think this is exactly what AMD has finally learned. They've been dogged and trashed for years because of their shoddy software features, and now they’re taking a page out of Nvidias book.   Yes Int8 FSR 4 could work on older cards, but it would muddy the waters of brand perception. RDNA3 and RDNA2 users would think it’s ok, whereas RDNA4 users would have a much better experience.

I do think a laptop w/dock would be a much better option. Here is an open box laptop from bestbuy for roughly the same price and it has an Ryzen 9 8940HX+RTX 5060 which takes it from ""can it play ____"" to better than a PS5 and has DLSS support. It just doesn't look like an NES.    https://www.bestbuy.com/product/hp-omen-16-2k-144hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-8940hx-2025-32gb-ddr5-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-shadow-black/JJGH2L954G/sku/6626057/openbox?condition=good",AMD,2026-02-15 23:57:53,-1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9674895), 'word': 'Cy', 'start': 17, 'end': 19}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9462671), 'word': '##punk', 'start': 22, 'end': 26}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6223854), 'word': 'Steam', 'start': 518, 'end': 523}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5181631), 'word': 'PS', 'start': 805, 'end': 807}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.57908005), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 817, 'end': 819}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.50552136), 'word': '##S', 'start': 862, 'end': 863}]",Tópico 5

I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,nxvyiba,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.

Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected.

I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.
