Intel,npclgdx,"It'll happen eventually but they have a few issues.  First is memory bandwidth, they'd need to put a wider bus on it to address which is costly.  Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power.

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.

Is there any greater penalty (latency or cache-flush-wise) for moving threads off the LP-island to P-cores?  *Thanks for the insides so far though!* I can't really see through anymore to all these constant arch-changes.",hardware,2025-11-08 04:12:06,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9700973), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 27, 'end': 29}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9627578), 'word': 'E', 'start': 30, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78568393), 'word': 'M', 'start': 235, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89533305), 'word': 'MTL', 'start': 258, 'end': 261}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7244196), 'word': 'ARL', 'start': 262, 'end': 265}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.963476), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 268, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91517353), 'word': 'E', 'start': 271, 'end': 272}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9977799), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 650, 'end': 655}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9967327), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 662, 'end': 667}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6198674), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 691, 'end': 693}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7871024), 'word': 'MTL', 'start': 704, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9685738), 'word': 'LNL', 'start': 943, 'end': 946}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8394278), 'word': 'PTL', 'start': 947, 'end': 950}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8412916), 'word': 'N', 'start': 951, 'end': 952}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9616567), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 979, 'end': 981}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95923656), 'word': 'E', 'start': 982, 'end': 983}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.39727136), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 1060, 'end': 1062}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.32601565), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 1239, 'end': 1241}]",Tópico 2

Intel,nito8rq,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",hardware,2025-10-10 19:19:56,-3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5901546), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 478, 'end': 480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9591582), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 657, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5589075), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 840, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8458032), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 861, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.894982), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 872, 'end': 874}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83673716), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 897, 'end': 899}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9113383), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 960, 'end': 967}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9057014), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1045, 'end': 1051}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8788988), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1331, 'end': 1337}]",Tópico 2

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance.

Intel,netnyfa,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny.

Intel,nes030p,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,28,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99808574), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62145495), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5235774), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99834645), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8335045), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99116546), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87709266), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99863094), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96411914), 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9881472), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9686659), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5841449), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980452), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99846077), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99331963), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8186365), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8931222), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982552), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4744853), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9968098), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972773), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961228), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 2

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,8,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614326), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643026), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6044749), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.42064992), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713012), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 3

AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

Intel,nrxkne9,"Your CPU is fine – a 13700KF isn’t holding you back in Warzone/BF. The weak link right now is the RAM. You’ve got 32GB of DDR4-3200, which is pretty slow for that chip. Swapping to a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 CL16 is cheap and will help 1% lows and overall smoothness.  On the GPU side: even though you “only” see ~80% usage, it can still be the limiter. GPU usage is an average – it can spike to 99% in microbursts, and as long as GPU frame time is higher than CPU frame time, the GPU is what’s capping FPS. In practice, if the GPU is consistently loaded more than the CPU in a game, you’re effectively GPU-bound.  If you want more FPS right now, a 4070 Ti Super or 4080 Super is the logical upgrade. If you’re not in a rush, you could skip a mid-cycle upgrade and wait for a 50-series card (5070/5080/5090) once prices settle – that’ll be a bigger jump per dollar than going from a 4070 to another 40-series card today.  Also, the HYTE Y40 looks great but can be a bit tight on GPU airflow. Adding a couple of bottom intake fans blowing at the GPU is a cheap tweak that helps temps and lets the card hold higher boost clocks.

Intel,noy0ero,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",pcmasterrace,2025-11-15 07:22:01,1,Positive,Anger,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91723), 'word': 'Arc B', 'start': 7, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9098242), 'word': 'R', 'start': 64, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.96850383), 'word': 'Ya', 'start': 250, 'end': 252}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.9011874), 'word': '##za Ki', 'start': 254, 'end': 259}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96355796), 'word': 'PS3', 'start': 417, 'end': 420}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.95793694), 'word': 'Ki', 'start': 478, 'end': 480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8416522), 'word': 'Y', 'start': 492, 'end': 493}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7486286), 'word': 'D', 'start': 775, 'end': 776}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8886654), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 983, 'end': 987}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.50996536), 'word': '##G', 'start': 1027, 'end': 1028}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99695504), 'word': 'Java', 'start': 1067, 'end': 1071}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6577868), 'word': 'OpenG', 'start': 1076, 'end': 1081}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9338671), 'word': 'Mesa', 'start': 1122, 'end': 1126}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8307985), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1131, 'end': 1138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95250285), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1214, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7680797), 'word': 'OpenGL', 'start': 1234, 'end': 1240}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96446764), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1256, 'end': 1263}]",Tópico 1

I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.

When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency.

Switch over to vulkan, which in cs2's case is very poorly implemented and sucks in comparison to dx11, with visual glitches and crashes being frequently, and the performance improves in almost 30% in all tests I made. This is not the case with any other card. AMD and Nvidia cards will present a drop in performance on cs2 when using Vulkan. The exact same issue is present in squad44 and most other dx11 or older games I tested (Watch Dogs, Far Cry 4, GMOD), as soon as I switch to a newer api like dx12 for Squad or dxvk for those older games, the performance improves drastically. I already reported this problem to Intel in their forums, but so far nothing. I'm not the first one to do so either, so I doubt Intel will fix them anytime soon, if they fix it at all. DirectX 12 and vulkan games run flawlessly, I just finished the remake of silent hill 2 at epic settings and ray tracing on, and the b580 performed really well, even for such a badly optimized game like sh2r.

The CPU can't read VRAM in any sensible way, you can't use more than 2 GB of it *and* you have all the limitations Shader Model 3.0 imposes, so very good luck in trying to run any non-immediate shader program.  DX9 does not get the job done. It's debatable whether it did back in the day.

Same results so far with every single DX11 or older game, Squad44 is literally unplayable for me on DX11, less than 60 fps at any graphics settings, switch to DX12, and magically I can run it at 1080p high settings at at least 120.

If you have any other ideas, I would love to hear it, but so far I noticed even the benchmarks Intel does in their forums present this issue, but they are camouflaged because Intel run their tests at 1440p and high settings, so in their tests, CS2 runs around 10% slower than the 4060, but no sane person plays a competitive shooter at 1440p high settings, most CS players literally play the game in 4:3 resolusion just to squeeze some frames, which makes the game more CPU bound. So naturally, running the tests at 1440p high settings will mask a potential CPU overhead issue.",pcmasterrace,2025-12-01 23:25:53,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88845783), 'word': 'CapframeX', 'start': 212, 'end': 221}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7528485), 'word': 'CS', 'start': 386, 'end': 388}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9943771), 'word': 'D', 'start': 473, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5659772), 'word': '##11', 'start': 475, 'end': 477}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6442628), 'word': 'V', 'start': 525, 'end': 526}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7454301), 'word': '##ulkan', 'start': 526, 'end': 531}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8221973), 'word': 'CS', 'start': 541, 'end': 543}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7853384), 'word': 'Vulkan', 'start': 547, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9957612), 'word': 'D', 'start': 676, 'end': 677}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75736326), 'word': 'Squad', 'start': 696, 'end': 701}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98942274), 'word': 'D', 'start': 738, 'end': 739}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5045769), 'word': '##11', 'start': 740, 'end': 742}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95829076), 'word': 'D', 'start': 797, 'end': 798}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9968972), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 921, 'end': 931}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88071823), 'word': 'CS', 'start': 985, 'end': 987}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99766093), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 1008, 'end': 1018}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9981388), 'word': 'Windows 10', 'start': 1031, 'end': 1041}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99701035), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1153, 'end': 1158}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99646914), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1233, 'end': 1238}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5254025), 'word': 'CS', 'start': 1302, 'end': 1304}]",Tópico 1

And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone.

Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89827603), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9951883), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 14, 'end': 17}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8116603), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 134, 'end': 140}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943714), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 298, 'end': 301}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972882), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 378, 'end': 383}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99413234), 'word': 'PS5 Pro', 'start': 429, 'end': 436}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7661482), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 642, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66854084), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 680, 'end': 683}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9977957), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 867, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9570874), 'word': 'Mac', 'start': 982, 'end': 985}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5452827), 'word': 'Surface', 'start': 1172, 'end': 1179}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67135006), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 1180, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6322727), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1203}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8328685), 'word': 'MacBook', 'start': 1219, 'end': 1226}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9923981), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 1264, 'end': 1273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8510156), 'word': 'Office', 'start': 1297, 'end': 1303}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8244395), 'word': 'Surface', 'start': 1382, 'end': 1389}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8934209), 'word': 'MacBook', 'start': 1428, 'end': 1435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8903413), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1478, 'end': 1481}]",Tópico 2
Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.66826093), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658418), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568377), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9011492), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040777), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75001216), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83806634), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164697), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8814712), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97932374), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90052766), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748384), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866346), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113533), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401754), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70765054), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8874185), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076941), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363593), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,69,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98579425), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6807291), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.53338945), 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8288872), 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89765465), 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8723923), 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87449735), 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.521104), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.63087887), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9507804), 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5053174), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8337847), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69437164), 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5678219), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6214106), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62806386), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 3

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67433), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718553), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9804187), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.789196), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56807995), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224169), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943218), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6215225), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8683438), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277298), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.74155277), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8893399), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7274337), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.985618), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676907), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811373), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200319), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515256), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5171995), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736856), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 3

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9496492), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378576), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8405343), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.68534803), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 1

And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified.

The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to.

It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space.

Intel,nndr8zp,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Intel,2025-11-06 07:19:59,5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5140123), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 292, 'end': 294}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9971359), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 314, 'end': 319}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9804203), 'word': 'PowerVia', 'start': 489, 'end': 497}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99182194), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 647, 'end': 649}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9875255), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 899, 'end': 902}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9622611), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 995, 'end': 1005}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98830426), 'word': 'Fire Range', 'start': 1016, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80416834), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 1204, 'end': 1206}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4943107), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1316, 'end': 1317}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91734356), 'word': 'U', 'start': 1512, 'end': 1513}]",Tópico 2

Intel,nirs4bu,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads.

Intel,nixt1zv,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,niy0ck1,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

By the time the prices have started rising its too late.  If a gpu is available at msrp at launch you can rarely find better value later in the gen as prices dont drop anymore until the next gen. So yeah either buy at launch and msrp or wait for the next cycle   Imo if you are on a complete potato gpu now and need a cheap upgrade then second hand 3060ti are very cheap (190 euros) , else a 5070ti is the only thing id consider to have any performance/price right now.

If this trend continues and AI race actually takes off, where does that leave normal PC enthusiasts / DIY culture that started in 1980's. We can't assemble computers without RAM, SSDs or GPUs.  DIY PC pays by far the least for silicon of any market, so it eats last. You can expect DIY PC builds to not really be sensible for many quarters.   Regrettably, we are in the very early innings on this trend. Things will get a lot worse before they get better. The first sign that things are normalizing will be sensible pricing on OEM PC builds. They are able to make volume contracts than retail can't support.  >Plus, the recent thrust by both Intel and AMD to go for APU / integrated architecture makes me believe that the industry is pushing consumers towards locked hardware that cannot be customized, and we all would eventually be forced to use NUCs or laptops that come with soldered RAM and CPU or even worse, integrated SOC with GPU.  APUs make a lot more sense than low-end dGPU products. Making a dGPU requires a bunch of infrastructure components that add cost and size to the design. Those things make sense if you are building something big and powerful. If you are instead making a mainstream 1080p graphics solution, an integrated graphics solution with on-package memory is cheaper and better.  >Would love to know your views on how this thing will eventually play out.

IE the PC platform should be open and not  inaccessible and proprietary lego as I think most enthusiast can relate to, flashbacks to learning about computers for the first time.  **a lot** can be written here, but imagine. Hardware is getting more expensive, which increases the staying power of older hardware and you also have other influences here. Performance ceiling is being reached. Hopefully central patents are starting to expire. People expectation on longevity is increasing(at least in gaming). Views are shifting are now like a utility or tool, central to your home which is supposed to universally work. If not the current view, this is the direction things are going, even with corporate pushback. Nothing will drive this more than enthusiasts leading the charge with openness, while the Joe Schmoe is being squeezed economically. Meanwhile for nations, dependencies is being framed as a national security issue.  This is going to sound elitist, but at least for the gaming sphere, there is a thick layer of commercialism and surface layer understanding of how things work. The AMD day one driver debacle being the biggest ""self selection event""/litmus test I have ever seen. I think the issue with the gaming space though is that it defines themselves around performance of the hardware, which is why a shift or renewal needs to happen. That seems to be happening, considering how often people yap about no needing hardware and playing classics. Going down that road, then is there not a space for hardware manufactureres and/or a lower barrier to entry for manufactures if cutting edge is not so central anymore? Consider that consumer software still often runs on one core.  All in all I think expensive hardware and bad economy relatively chokes off the unhealthy aspect of DYI PC market, more than...let's say ""pure"" part of it. Also worth mentioning is that argueable, the packaging of a PC and the expertise relatively increases now, which is where convenient software and hardware solutions live.

AMD,nscidvk,"I think you're reading too much into that one event. Remember that Micron/Crucial ended their Ballistix branding with DDR5 three years ago. They never had much in the way of offerings in the DDR5 generation, and what die they had were the worst of the three DRAM manufacturers. Micron chips work best around 5200 and can range up to 5600, but any kits above that rating are utilizing extremely binned chips at high voltages. I don't know of any reason why Micron couldn't redesign their DRAM to be competitive, but they clearly chose not to. Even Samsung's memory clocks higher, though it doesn't clock anywhere close to SK Hynix chips nor can reach their timings.  It's worth pointing out the people who had the most trouble with memory on their DDR5 builds were more often than not using Micron or Samsung based kits. I'm sure the heavy returns hurt their financials. But you should realize that Micron's current DDR5 offering was about to be made moot. Intel already clocks over 7000, and AMD is going to (farking finally) launch its 2nd gen DDR5 controller that should move the bar well above the 6000 sweet spot. Not even OEMs are going to be buying 5200-5600 kits regardless of price, meaning without a die redesign the only space left to offload chips would be servers and that's what Micron is now doing.  The AI bubble will pop, money isn't infinite and spending billions to make a few million every quarter isn't sustainable. There is no magic market that will materialize to fill in that gap disparity. Short of creating a true AI that can act as a people replacement the AI bubble is going to pop... AI won't truly go away, we're stuck with it just like we're stuck with the internet. But we are very much in a bubble and it's hard to imagine a scenario where the hundreds of billions being blown on datacenter deployments won't end up with a massive overbuild of DCs that will cause multiple bankruptcies in the future. I used to think there would always be enough demand elsewhere to keep former-AI DC's in use, but we're quickly building past that level.  As for breaking up NVIDIA, I'm not sure how that'd be feasible, they design a single base tier uArch and then scale it across all market segments. Forking the company into a consumer-only GPU division would probably just create another Radeon situation where the company keeps prices high to amortize its dev costs across the consumer market, instead of across all of its markets.  Micron isn't going anywhere, they're just focusing exclusively on servers and enterprise where the margins are largest and product support is easiest. The other day I read that Micron is now going to build a $9.6 billion dollar HBM fab in Japan. It's unfortunate but not unexpected, all three HBM vendors have been selling out their entire annual HBM production 12-18 months in advance since 2023. If other DRAM vendors still existed they would've already jumped ship to chase those silly numbers too.  Maybe at some point in the future when there's a single vendor for some piece of the computer hardware the market might be at risk. But it seems unlikely, because OEMs buy consumer level hardware and in order to supply OEMs they have to produce the same parts consumers would buy regardless. In Micron's case the DRAM they're producing isn't even good enough to meet OEM's needs, let alone consumers.  Edit: Will say I've been corrected, Micron does make a newer gen die for DDR5 that tops out at 6400 in 16/24Gb flavors, and it's even available under their own branding. But it's sure not common and still suffers from high timings.",hardware,2025-12-05 01:14:07,0,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9745571), 'word': 'Micron / Crucial', 'start': 67, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99267954), 'word': 'Ballistix', 'start': 94, 'end': 103}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8577185), 'word': 'DDR', 'start': 118, 'end': 121}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7957779), 'word': 'DDR', 'start': 191, 'end': 194}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6362693), 'word': 'DR', 'start': 258, 'end': 260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8512765), 'word': 'Micron', 'start': 278, 'end': 284}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99338806), 'word': 'Micron', 'start': 456, 'end': 462}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986307), 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 547, 'end': 554}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98976314), 'word': 'SK Hynix', 'start': 621, 'end': 629}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9941148), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 747, 'end': 749}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8405926), 'word': 'Micron', 'start': 790, 'end': 796}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8900239), 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 800, 'end': 807}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9879061), 'word': 'Micron', 'start': 898, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8262943), 'word': 'DDR', 'start': 915, 'end': 918}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9979487), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 956, 'end': 961}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9898524), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 992, 'end': 995}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80147904), 'word': 'DDR', 'start': 1045, 'end': 1048}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8761745), 'word': 'O', 'start': 1127, 'end': 1128}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9798411), 'word': 'Micron', 'start': 1292, 'end': 1298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8658314), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 1318, 'end': 1320}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7950975), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 1583, 'end': 1585}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.57014006), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 1612, 'end': 1614}]",Tópico 2

Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away.

AMD,nrtytzk,Look at the Linux numbers. It’s overwhelmingly amd.   I do legit think there is a bug in collection on windows.  Not just amd cards but also nvidia newer cards due to a bug many of us think is happening on amd CPUs with an apu enabled. A lot of people are favoring x3d for gaming builds and the data looks weird there.   I have two desktops: a windows box with 265k and 6900xt and a Linux box with a ryzen 7900 and 9060xt. My wife has a 5900x with 7900xt and a 3700x with a nvidia 960 on Linux.   Steam last took surveys from my systems around June. That was before I got the 265k and 9060xt. (Had a 14700k in windows and arc a750 in Linux) my wife hasn’t had a survey since before she got the 7900xt last year.   I expect nvidia to win as well as Intel on cpu due to Internet cafes in Asia along with trends there on purchases but I still feel like amd and nvidia should have more share on their newer gpus.   Sometimes I wish valve did more breakdowns like what the specs are on systems with current gen CPUs and gpus. (Most popular current builds)  also builds by region.  I except a slam dunk for Intel and nvidia in Asia.

It also shows the 7800 XT share increasing more in november alone (+0.13%)  than any 9000 series card over its entire lifetime (none crack 0.15%). It does not track with sales data whatsoever.  AMD representation is prebuilts was always very low, but has vastly increased due to the undeniably great value of the 9060XT. The 7600XT was a very poor seller, especially in prebuilts, which tend to go for cheaper options, since it was much more expensive than the 7600 and only offered extra VRAM.  Even more absurdly. The representation of the 7800XT in the Steam survey in has grown more in November alone (+0.13%) than the overall market share of any single 9000 series card. (none crack the 0.15% number to make it onto the list). Do you genuinely believe the 7800 XT sold more in november alone than any 9000 series card has since release?  It does not compute. It probably just registers the integrated graphics on the CPU or nothing at all for the GPU. I suspect that Valve just rejects DxDiag data from GPUs that have not been added to the list. I suspect they just haven't gotten around to adding the RDNA 4 cards there due to the change in naming scheme, while the 5000 series was added before release, since the naming scheme was consistent.  It clearly shows decent market share on Linux, which is admittedly likely to be inflated due to Nvidia drivers being pretty bad on Linux.

Things are all good until too much data is transferred at a time, where the transfer speeds tank to literally 100-200MB/s between two PCIe 4x4 drives.   This can be easily induced with multiple data transfers happening at the time, but it's not limited to those scenarios. I can plug in a SATA drive to have the third disk drive transferring files to either of the existing two, or start large downloads writing to one of my disks, and the system will be paralyzed with sub 100MB/s transfer speeds across all devices combined.  My mobo's front drive slot is actually PCIe 5 connected to the CPU, and the secondary one is PCIe 4 connected to the chipset, so the hardware should theoretically easily accept faster drives.  While seeking support, I was told it is expected behavior due to IO bottlenecks that aren't restricted by pure bandwidth, but the logic queueing the requests that can get overwhelmed.

AMD,npj9v4j,"The same reason Intel's Lunar Lake was a one-off.  Companies run a percentage profit margin they report to their investors. If they produce a good that costs 50$ to make, and sell it for 100$, then they have a profit margin of 50%. For investors this means that every dollar they put into production results in 2 dollars of capital, which is a good indicator for potential growth, and, of course, potential dividend payout.  If costs increase by 10$, then, if price were left unchanged, their profit margin would sink to 40%. if They increase their price by 10$ as well their profit margin would sink to ~55%. Investors will look at those numbers and conclude that the company is doing poorly: it is no longer able to achieve the same return on investment that it did previously, and they might just conclude that their money can be better spent elsewhere and cancel further investments.  So, a 10$ cost increase results in a 20$ price hike. In reality, profit margins aren't really that high for third-parties like Asus and others, investors can be persuaded that the costs aren't due to mismanagement and companies will take a hit in profitability in the short-run to maintain marketshare (although, again, AIB companies generally run razor-thin profit margins).  Another reason for adding margin to price-hikes is Machiavellian psychology: Gigabyte and others know the way the wind is blowing, RAM prices are going to keep climbing for the foreseeable future and people respond worse to smaller price increases every month than a big price increase every 6 months. So they'll add some padding now, 'worst' case they can drop the price later or give greater discounts during sales, best case they're better insulated from any future inflation.",hardware,2025-11-18 18:29:07,11,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99806935), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 16, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5744264), 'word': 'Luna', 'start': 24, 'end': 28}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6070799), 'word': '##r', 'start': 28, 'end': 29}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75735366), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 30, 'end': 34}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70139474), 'word': 'Asus', 'start': 1016, 'end': 1020}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99683046), 'word': 'AIB', 'start': 1209, 'end': 1212}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8699519), 'word': 'Machiavellian', 'start': 1317, 'end': 1330}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72139275), 'word': 'Giga', 'start': 1343, 'end': 1347}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91086435), 'word': 'RAM', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1400}]",Tópico 1

This is a fairly straightforward optimization problem. Total profit = per unit profit \* volume. There's also a tradeoff between per unit profit and volume: The higher the per unit profit (and therefore sale price) the lower the volume, and vice versa. When per unit profit is zero then total profit is zero, and likewise when volume is zero total profit is also zero. Somewhere between those two extremes there's a point of maximum total profit. Because per unit profit is price - cost, a change is cost is going to have a relatively larger effect on per unit profits, possibly even putting it negative without a price change. This will cause the optimal price point to move towards higher per unit profit, lower volume. This is what causes the price to go even higher than just the increase in cost.  Thinking of it as greed isn't helpful. This is a very straightforward logical deduction.

To me it's like you're building a table for 8 hours and getting $200 in labour and praying $100 in wood, tools, etc. you'd probably charge $300 for the table. $100+$200.  33.3% is your cost in parts, and 66.6% is your profit margins that is also your hourly pay in a way.   Now imagine your parts cost went up by $100 to $200. Do you now charge $200+$200?

After all, you want to maintain the same 66.6% margin. $200-$400.

If I went from 66k a year annual net income to 133k, because my supplies cost went from 33k to 66k, that would be weird. Now admittedly, you'd sell a lot fewer tables, so you'd probably not hit those yearly goals. But in part that's your own fault for doubling your table sale price.

My point was that it's fair to ask for more money based on how much you've invested, be that either time (hours worked) or money (buying materials)      Philosophically: If my profit margin is 100% based on the labor, an increase in cost of materials has no impact on it.    You ALSO forgot to account for the cost of you time, i.e. how much are these 8 hours worth if I'm not building this table. What is 8 hours at minimum wage? What's 8 hours working for somebody elses company worth? This is opportunity cost. You're just assuming the labour is 100% profit, which breaks real-word profitability analysis.    To make it fair, you should be calculating the cost of hiring someone to build the table, and you then sell it. You're not going to have 66.6% profit margins.  Anyway...  If the parts cost goes up to $200, and my hours worked stays the same, an absolute minimum price would be $400. And especially if you market your services as ""no profit on materials, only work"". You might do this, because sales/VAT taxation reasons like if materials are taxed higher, but labour is lower. So you give a receipt for materials, bill them as paid-for (0 profit) and then bill your work.    This way of doing things, your profit margin technically doesn't change, since the material is expensed at-cost, your business is selling your labor. You're just expensing the materials, not selling it to the customer. It's almost a balance sheet transaction, that doesn't appear on the P&L.

AMD,npqt711,"Well, it seems AMD has something... Sarcasm aside, nice to see DF's input on this 'early look' of FSR RR.  A lot of strange things observed. With the same settings AMD has some things omitted compared to Nvidia, as seen with shadows in a distance, it's quality, as well with objects reflected like with lights (can't say for sure if this an AMDs or dev thing, regardless it doesn't matter to the end user to who's fault).  With FSR RR, the most noticeable spotted difference from at first glance is the retrieval quality and AA from the reconstructed/regenerated scene. DLSS RR is better which shouldn't be shocking. This is due to how AMD does their upscaling passes with RR, as you can choose whatever upscaling method you want with RR and how it can be clearly seen with water reflections. FSR4 Perf is noticeably blurrier than FSR4 Native when comparing the reflections in the water, while it wouldn't matter what DLSS quality setting you use in conjunction w/ DLSS RR. As an aside, I found it interesting how FSR4 Perf had better texture detail on the letters than DLSS4 Perf (that said perhaps could be a sharpening thing outside of the upscalers used).  Moving on, FSR RR has missing features as noted with how reflections should be reconstructed. Reflected objects/scenes do not correctly diffuse, and are sharp throughout (typing this, I use [10:20](https://youtu.be/RuASMLRGFus?si=p1ECIQiTwNLLxeT0&t=617), but interestingly enough w/ DLSS RR, the gun has noticeable artifcating maybe due to the denoiser?). Environments with FSR RR do not have correct contact lighting as seen with the part about the trash can.  AMD does have some things going for it (though, I suspect is more per game basis). In motion, DLSS RR while clearer experiences more ghosting/smearing elements compared to FSR RR. That said, can't be said for the disocclusion aspect as seen with swapping guns with water in the foreground (that said I wonder if this is again the same problem with the upscaler/denoiser pass with FSR RR or if the problems with game settings between AMD and Nvidia has something to do with it like SSR).  There are things to note about performance, but isn't wildly different, so I won't make comments there.  Overall, again strange to say the least. It's obvious FSR RR isn't quite done, which can be worrying considering it's still one part of Redstone. Also, the game itself isn't a good test bed for the feature (as if it only being enabled for MP wasn't obvious enough) as there are bugs and instabilities. I guess, if anything, AMD has a step in the door which will have improvements. That said, isn't quite like with FSR4 in terms of wow. Not only that FSR4 can easily be swapped with Optiscaler and recently in AMD's own driver with most DX12 games. This one seems to be dependent on AMD actually implementing it with games so unless there are workarounds no DLSS RR swapping with FSR RR.",hardware,2025-11-19 22:14:11,16,Neutral,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8805181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 15, 'end': 18}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95172584), 'word': 'DF', 'start': 63, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8328462), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 98, 'end': 101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8254398), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 164, 'end': 167}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.51479554), 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 204, 'end': 208}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8905936), 'word': 'F', 'start': 428, 'end': 429}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49815166), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 570, 'end': 572}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7913989), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 636, 'end': 639}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7258965), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 1172, 'end': 1175}]",Tópico 1
AMD,npu5it8,"I was hoping Ray Regeneration was going to be a simultaneous denoising and upscaling approach, they were [investing research in it](https://gpuopen.com/learn/neural_supersampling_and_denoising_for_real-time_path_tracing/) and suggested they had something working in [an admittedly artifact-ridden demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vLil19mBs&t=21s). Instead this seems to be a spatiotemporal ML denoiser. It's completely decoupled from upscaling so appears to be denoiser pass before upscaling which ends up cutting out high frequency details and reconstructing to a lower res so you don't get that sharp DLSS RR resolve.   At least in it's current form it's not really an effective competitor to DLSS RR, rather it's competing with standard denoisers like NRD. Which makes me worry about adoption - NRD is vendor agnostic, as are most denoisers. I doubt this could be injected generally like Optiscaler since it is decoupled from upscaler outputs and probably designed to run in it's own pass. Maybe it could be modded to run on DLSS RR inputs before upscaling if the algorithm is general enough? While I hope it's better by Redstone showing I don't see how they could improve the detail reconstruction if it's acting before upscaling  Edit: not to undermine what has been achieved here - it's a very competent denoiser, and imo beneficial over COD's default at identical cost. it just doesn't push any boundaries whereas DLSS RR remains surprisingly coherent when reconstructing small RT details or high gloss reflections",hardware,2025-11-20 13:04:08,5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6277374), 'word': 'Ray Regeneration', 'start': 13, 'end': 29}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6896856), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 610, 'end': 612}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7423322), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 702, 'end': 706}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67550546), 'word': 'N', 'start': 762, 'end': 763}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60781395), 'word': 'N', 'start': 805, 'end': 806}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60988253), 'word': 'Optiscale', 'start': 898, 'end': 907}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7158437), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1035, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9947726), 'word': 'Redstone', 'start': 1131, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6104394), 'word': 'CO', 'start': 1351, 'end': 1353}]",Tópico 1

AMD,npu96bd,"I'm guessing the issues with contact hardening is mainly down to how the network was trained, reconstructing glossy reflections from low sample counts in real-time is challenging and one where DLSS RR is obviously better. Because it's denoising at internal resolution, the start of the hardening penumbra will be be softer than DLSS RR even if it should be sharp. Compared to the in-game denoiser I think FSR RR is actually mostly beneficial (except the water which has had all the ripple detail removed and the extreme ghosting with gun disocclusion) and it seems to be free, although DLSS RR isn't horrifically expensive on newer cards. I'm hoping this is a stepping stone to a simultaneous denoising and upscaling solution because the magic of DLSS RR is it's ability to reconstruct sharp ray traced detail even at low internal resolution, something that this multi pass technique probably can't do (although it can be made sharper, [NRD managed it by denoising with a detail recovery pass that respected DLSS jitter](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRD?tab=readme-ov-file#improving-output-quality)).  Optiscaler is magic in getting FSR4 in most titles but I fear this technique won't see much adoption at all - denoising passes aren't typically general so this is something that would need per-engine integration. I suppose it could intercept RR inputs (assuming there's equivalent) to do one pass denoise then standard upscale but unless the inbuilt denoiser is terrible it's probably not worth it",hardware,2025-11-20 13:26:35,3,Neutral,Fear,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7241226), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 193, 'end': 195}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7190668), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 328, 'end': 330}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6635032), 'word': 'F', 'start': 405, 'end': 406}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.49017364), 'word': '##SR R', 'start': 406, 'end': 410}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.65017366), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 586, 'end': 588}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7179796), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 747, 'end': 749}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7654234), 'word': 'N', 'start': 937, 'end': 938}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7952476), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1008, 'end': 1010}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.68629515), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.42505398), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1345, 'end': 1346}]",Tópico 3

AMD,npu25g3,"I can very much read, thank you.  9070 does fine in pretty much any RT title, benchmarks show as much. It beats the 5070 in RT, but also has enough VRAM to fully leverage the power it has available for heavy RT.  Your examples are Black myth: Wukong, AW2 and Indiana jones, and only with the most extreme RT settings. The most similarly priced Nvidia card, the 5070, performs worse in two of those three titles. In Wukong, where it's beating it, it's still delivering unplayable framerates due to the fast-paced nature of the game.  It should also be noted that your example benchmarks were produced on PRE-RELEASE DRIVERS. Those same prerelease drivers had launch FSR 4, which had a much higher latency penalty than it currently does. Current drivers have brought huge performance boosts, something like 10-15% over launch performance, even accounting for outliers.  Those performance gains have been especially big in RT games, where the base 9070 tends to beat the 5070 across the board now, while it was hit or miss at launch.  Like yes, the 5070Ti is still objectively better for RT than the 9070 XT, but it's also 25% more expensive. That still doesn't make the 9070 XT a slouch. It's still better than a 5070 in RT pretty much across the board, even where the 5070 isn't being strangled by the 12GB VRAM buffer.  Driver optimizations like opacity micromaps, shader execution reordering, neural radiance caching and an ML denoiser will only ever close that gap to the 5070 Ti further. Admittedly OMM and SER isn't hardware accelerated like on Nvidia hardware, but should still yield decent uplifts. NRC and ML denoising should both bring double digit performance uplifts, however.  People forget that on a pure hardware level, the 9070 XT has 5-10% more theoretical RT compute than the 5070 Ti. It just lacks the software feature set Nvidia has, and a few hardware-accelerated refinements, notably OMM and SER. It is not inconceivable that the 9070 XT could reach parity with the 5070 Ti in RT.",hardware,2025-11-20 12:41:55,0,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76819885), 'word': 'R', 'start': 68, 'end': 69}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95803994), 'word': 'Black', 'start': 231, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.44762984), 'word': 'Wu', 'start': 243, 'end': 245}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66586107), 'word': '##kon', 'start': 245, 'end': 248}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7674875), 'word': 'A', 'start': 251, 'end': 252}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.99872345), 'word': 'Indiana', 'start': 259, 'end': 266}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5861089), 'word': 'R', 'start': 305, 'end': 306}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98618084), 'word': 'N', 'start': 344, 'end': 345}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.7823201), 'word': 'Wu', 'start': 415, 'end': 417}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.52137417), 'word': '##kon', 'start': 417, 'end': 420}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.78155965), 'word': '##g', 'start': 420, 'end': 421}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8570163), 'word': 'FSR 4', 'start': 665, 'end': 670}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8580045), 'word': 'R', 'start': 920, 'end': 921}]",Tópico 1

Thanks for the example. It illustrates very well what I'm talking about. From what I've heard the hardware Lumen in The Outer Worlds 2 is broken but usually it looks significantly better than software Lumen. I think most people would gladly sacrifice 7% performance for that, because usually the difference is like low vs ultra graphics. No massive Lumen ghosting either.

It's not that RT doesn't cost a lot of performance it's just that software Lumen is just as expensive as it's wildly inefficient. The 5090 does indeed struggle at native 4K, but it struggles in general and hardware Lumen has nothing to do with it.

But now every time I try to juggle the parts list and the prices it makes no damn sense to upgrade. I don't even really need to it's just my love for building rigs and passing down my old ones to my brother or other family members.   I was waiting for the end of the year to do it but with RAM prices having gone through the roof it makes no sense at all, like I was counting on getting a normal 6000Mhz CL30 kit, they were going for 120/140 bucks, now they're over 300 or more.   Heck I almost bought a 2x24GB 6000Mhz CL26 kit for 320 bucks three months ago to call it a day and I chickened out thinking they would get cheaper lol.   I remember this happened with DDR4 around 2018 or so, but the prices were still somewhat acceptable, like a good kit was around 90/110 and they went to 180/200. Expensive, but not deal breakers.

There is no longer a product offering that provides performance within spitting distance of the 90/Titan class card. Fact.  >So if you claim that the 70 is good, then 80 just got better.  I never claimed that at all, don't put words in my mouth.  The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation. You bringing up the 5070 stat is meaningless, especially when the 5070 is only about as good as the last generation 4070 Super. It fails to even beat the 4070 Ti, when every other 70 class card before it was at least able to soundly beat the 70 Ti of the last generation.  Taking all of this into account, it's clear the utter lack of generational uplift on the 5070 is what's responsible for the 5080's growing lead. Insinuating that this is instead the result of 5080 being good value or providing good generational uplift rather than the 5070's failure to improve is completely disingenuous.  And we see this all across the 50 series' product lineup. The 5060 Ti 16 GB can't even beat the 4070, when the 3060 Ti was beating the 2080 Super. The 5060 can't even beat the 4060 Ti 8 GB, when the 3060 was beating the 2070. The 5070 Ti can at best match the 4080, when the 4070 Ti was beating the 3090.  And all this is corroborated by the [diminishing relative core count](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/cuda_percent_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp) to the flagship we see in these newer generations. The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  If we look at the 30 series (the last generation to provide generational improvements across the board, and not just for select cards), we see how bad it currently is.  The 5080 offers 50% of the 5090's core count for 50% of the price. Seems reasonable, but it becomes a shit value proposition when you consider that the 3070 offered **56%** of the 3090's core count for only **33%** of the price. For a more direct relative price comparison, the 3080 offered **83%** of the 3090's cores for **53%** of the price.  The 5070 offers 28% of the 5090's cores for 27.5% of the price. Again, seems reasonable until you consider the price to relative core ratio of the 3070 I just mentioned. To rub salt into the wound, spending **26.6%** of the 3090's MSRP would have gotten you a 3060 Ti with **46.3%** of the cores.  By relative core count, the 5080 should be a 70 class. And this translates over to performance, too. The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090, while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was. What used to be the 80 class is extinct, there's no denying it.  I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here.

Thus, flagship performance is a really bad baseline to work with. What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites - and this baseline IS actually relevant for gaming.  >The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation. You bringing up the 5070 stat is meaningless, especially when the 5070 is only about as good as the last generation 4070 Super. It fails to even beat the 4070 Ti, when every other 70 class card before it was at least able to soundly beat the 70 Ti of the last generation.  Which also means nothing because we are talking about the prices for the consumer. Whether the market stagnates or not is IRRELEVANT to the level of pricing.  >And all this is corroborated by the [diminishing relative core count](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/cuda_percent_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp) to the flagship we see in these newer generations. The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  Which is even less relevant. It does not matter. Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance. Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  >I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here. Unless you literally work for their PR department and are paid to do this, you gain absolutely nothing trying to justify and rationalize the diminishing returns and increasing shrinkflation we've been seeing from the consumer cards. It's baffling behaviour to fight so hard on the behalf of a corporation that doesn't even know you exist.  I am not - if you think about it, you are actually the one ""batting for Nvidia"". You are the one trying to state that Nvidia used to be much better - And I am telling you: No, they weren't. That is just nostalgia glasses and a confound of the overall economic situation.

AMD,ns4z2t6,">Why even write that as a seemingly positive example then? That is just misleading.  Because we're discussing the stagnation of the 50 series here, buddy.  >They can release a 90 series card that is just a refresh  And this is nothing more than a meaningless hypothetical. The 90 class cards are the only ones that have been consistently getting the generation to generation performance improvements, and the fact is that the rest of the lineup hasn't followed suit. Sure, if the 6090 has a performance uplift as marginal as the one from the 3090 to the 3090 Ti then your argument may have a leg to stand on. But that has not happened. Well, it did for the 5070, but that's another topic.  The 80 class used to provide similar die sizes and core counts as the 90/Titan class. It no longer does. No matter what mental gymnastics you'd like to do to justify this, you cannot deny this.  >What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites  And given the shrinking relative core counts and die sizes, it's clear that Nvidia can set these mid range tiers just as arbitrarily as they set ""the comparison for flagship"" as you say. You bring up the hypothetical that they can release a next gen 90 series card that is just a refresh. I bring up the reality that they *actually did that* for the 5070. Tell me then, why would the ""main consumer cards"" serve as a better baseline when the exact thing you claimed might happen to the 90 series actually happened to the 70 series?  If anything, your ""5070 -> 5080 = 50%"" is even more invalid than making comparisons to the flagship class, because the 70 class is a stagnant product and what your comparison is really saying is that the 5080 is only 50% faster than a 70 class card from the last generation.  >Which also means nothing because we are talking about the prices for the consumer. Whether the market stagnates or not is IRRELEVANT to the level of pricing.  It does mean something, because you are completely ignoring the aspect of value here. The 5070 being $50 less than the 4070 Super is not a particularly big win when I could have bought the 4070 Super at launch and got an entire year of usage out of it before the 5070 even came out and provided no performance uplift.  Hell, by your logic, they could have released the 5070 at $600 (making it a literal rebadge of the 4070 Super) and you would have been fine with that, and fine with comparing it to a 5080 because ""stagnation is irrelevant to pricing"". Never mind the shitty value proposition that would be.  You used to be able to spend less than a grand (even adjusted for inflation) on a 3080 and get something that was pretty much just as good as the best GPU in the world at the time. *That's* a meaningful metric for value, not comparing a 5080 to a lower tier graphics card that isn't even better than its predecessor.  >Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance.  Well, good thing I brought up performance in my comment then! Did you have trouble seeing it? I can make it bigger so you don't miss it this time.  # The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090 (at 50% the price), while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was (at 33% the price).  That's a pretty good argument for the shitty value of the current 80 class, no?  >Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  This only matters if we can get better performance out of shrinking dies. The 4070 Super had a much smaller die than the 3090 and matched it in performance. In that case, sure, they got the same performance out of less silicon, and could justify the diminishing relative core count.  But saying it's a non argument no matter what as long as ""you get the performance you need"" is an awful argument. That is just settling for mediocrity and stagnation. By your logic, the 6070, and 7070, and 8070 could come out, be exactly the same as the 5070 for the same price, and it'd be a perfectly fine product because ""you get the performance you need"".  >that Nvidia used to be much better - And I am telling you: No, they weren't.  And how do you justify this? The hard fact is that you used to be able to buy a 70 class card that would match the flagship card of the previous generation. Or an 80 class card that would soundly beat it. Each new generation (save for a couple exceptions) offered incredible value in that sense. This one does not. You literally cannot ignore the diminishing generational improvements we have been seeing.  I'm not saying Nvidia was some great company before, but when we literally do not see the generational improvements they used to provide, how can you sit here and claim that ""they weren't better"" before?

If you want to make a billion dollars, there are two ways to do it - sell a billion things with a $1 profit margin, or 1 this with a $1 billion profit margin.  The structure of the taxes determines which is 'easier' or more highly incentivized.    Our tax system right now awards some of the lowest tax rates to the higher income earners (corporations and very wealthy individuals) - thus it is favorable to raise prices and sell fewer copies of each item.

Pair that with your space heater and it's basically doing the same job as two space heaters on low.

I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ngmx0bu,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,nqoo97z,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications.

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed.

Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.

AMD,n046z2m,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Intel,2025-06-27 19:06:33,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82722896), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 146, 'end': 148}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5852002), 'word': 'Mac', 'start': 253, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96073824), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 338, 'end': 340}]",Tópico 2

AMD,n049nak,"I take no side there. I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).
