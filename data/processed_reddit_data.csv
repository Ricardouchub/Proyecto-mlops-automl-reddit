Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Like, the volume for both ""launches"" is supposed to be low, actual devices probably won't be available to purchase until the next year, but. Companies are supposed to be receiving samples of Panther Lake. Now. Presently.   For them to say their roadmap isn't affected, isn't changed at all. Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than.

No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,27,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99808574, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6214537, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.52357626, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99834645, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.83350486, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99116546, 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8770928, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99863094, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9641192, 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9881471, 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96866584, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5841442, 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9980452, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99846077, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99331963, 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.81863767, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.89312124, 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9982552, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.47448224, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9968098, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9972773, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9961228, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 4

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,8,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.48614332, 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88643, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.604474, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.95716006, 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.420649, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4713005, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 4

Intel,nfb1vqa,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear.

I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.

Intel,ni8pfw8,"I'm more or less fine with this Game's performance.  On native, I get around 60FPS with my 5070TI with Raytracing (HW Lumen) disabled. With DLSSQ I get around 80FPS up to 100FPS. With DLSSQ and FrameGen I'm at 140FPS or more. All in WQHD. Framegen also reduces (yes, you read that right) Latency by a big chunk because Reflex is activated with it. An option to disable Framegen and activate Reflex would be cool, tho. I modded it in with SpecialK, but not offering an Option in the settings is a huge miss from the Devs. That game has huge Latency Spikes (up to 100MS) and you can feel it drastically. So Reflex is a must even without FrameGen.  I settled to use FrameGen with a Reshade called Lillium HDR Reshade witch offers a Reshade to Sharpen the Game, so I don't have many troubles with ghosting from Framegen. I also installed a Mod Manager named UltraModManager that greatly buffs visuals and offers a fix for black floors (Color grading is a little bit off in games from those Devs). Right now I play with Game with 120FPS+ with DLSS Q and Framegen enabled but without much noticeable Ghosting and with decent Latency and HW Lumen enabled. If you like to Fiddle with UE and don't hesitate to install Mods, it's a great Game. The ""Basic"" experience is meh, tho. Not because of the lack of FPS, but because of that huge Latency thing.   I also gained huge performance increase just by downgrading my Driver to 572.83.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,23,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96047413, 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97551155, 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.47393385, 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9978709, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9221623, 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9936434, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.70016813, 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.99374455, 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97952205, 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.996042, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9800243, 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9670311, 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9871013, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9752412, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9922133, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6682615, 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99653184, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86584127, 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.64568275, 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90114915, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87513644, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8040758, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7500115, 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8380654, 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8164692, 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.88147104, 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9793236, 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9005273, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.69748294, 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.58866495, 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.511351, 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99225956, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.80401796, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7076516, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88741785, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5076931, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7363588, 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9888704, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99029034, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone.

Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",AMD,2024-04-03 08:42:33,9,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98876595, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 226, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8690469, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 266, 'end': 269}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9643116, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 419, 'end': 422}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97362816, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 492, 'end': 495}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.59755176, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 726, 'end': 729}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.99718016, 'word': 'DirectX 12', 'start': 879, 'end': 889}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.62031287, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1402, 'end': 1404}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91604114, 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1466}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.995836, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.67432916, 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7718556, 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98041874, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7891968, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.56808084, 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6224168, 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9943219, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.997389, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.62152374, 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99866533, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86834437, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9983454, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8277303, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99850535, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7415536, 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88934016, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99857795, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.72743416, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.991135, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9856181, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99898607, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9676909, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99495494, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9952302, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6811376, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7200327, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99592286, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7515257, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5172002, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9934948, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.50736785, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 1

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).

More often than not any system issues im having end up being the fault of Microsoft, or a specific game wasnt tested on AMD properly and the blame lies with the devs.",AMD,2024-04-01 20:48:17,5,Negative,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92542624, 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 29, 'end': 33}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8244546, 'word': 'EV', 'start': 133, 'end': 135}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.978301, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 165, 'end': 168}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.57068884, 'word': 'R', 'start': 202, 'end': 203}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98619413, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 299, 'end': 302}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9922058, 'word': 'D', 'start': 389, 'end': 390}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.53306735, 'word': 'Na', 'start': 496, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.54683864, 'word': 'R', 'start': 501, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.45491752, 'word': '##NA', 'start': 503, 'end': 505}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9972282, 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 633, 'end': 640}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9787724, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 698, 'end': 701}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9960812, 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 888, 'end': 897}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9796407, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 934, 'end': 937}]",Tópico 4

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.949649, 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91378605, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7303601, 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975333, 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84053415, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6853485, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 3

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9945433, 'word': 'Nintendo', 'start': 23, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7072387, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 104, 'end': 108}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.736587, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 145, 'end': 149}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9411086, 'word': 'N', 'start': 262, 'end': 263}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99181014, 'word': 'C', 'start': 334, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7018669, 'word': '##UDA', 'start': 335, 'end': 338}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9394868, 'word': 'C', 'start': 595, 'end': 596}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.59285474, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 597, 'end': 599}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69475675, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 996, 'end': 999}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.93300354, 'word': 'PyTorch', 'start': 1181, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8076242, 'word': 'AL', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1397}]",Tópico 3

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9452912, 'word': 'Lenovo', 'start': 223, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8261307, 'word': 'Hogwartz', 'start': 805, 'end': 813}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9086967, 'word': 'Rachet', 'start': 815, 'end': 821}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6654186, 'word': 'Clank', 'start': 826, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.72740483, 'word': 'Re', 'start': 833, 'end': 835}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8370989, 'word': '2', 'start': 841, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9770279, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1467}]",Tópico 3

It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

As someone who wanted to buy a b580 for a rly long time but only for msrp, the card took like almost 9 months to hit msrp. I was watching it for a while and I did not feel like paying above msrp for it. Like until a few weeks ago all the ones available were like 50+ dollars over msrp. Now you can actually buy one for msrp at multiple places which is a good thing.   > How much of the problem would you say has been solved since release  The overhead problem hasn't been solved. I don't even think intel can fix it or has any interest in fixing it as they knew about it since december of last year and nothing has come out to try fix it. How big a problem is really dependant on what games you wanna play. It can only be like a 5% overhead issue which still puts it faster than the 4060 and 7600 but theres some games where it's like 20% or more where you have to have a very strong cpu to not see the overhead.  Do some research on the games you play and that will tell u whether to buy a b580 or a 9060 xt.

What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.

AMD,njl8r10,"Wowza, this is a bad write up based on a sum of leaks.  >Despite AMD's assertion that the Arm ISA doesn't provide any inherent efficiency advantage and that power savings are primarily dependent on the package and design, it seems AMD is developing an Arm-based SoC codenamed ""Sound Wave.""  This is just such a suggestive introduction. Because either the author wants to portray AMDs position on this issue as wrong (therefore claim AMD spreads misinformation) or really doesnt see any other way why AMD would make ARM Systems. Which could be to introduce ARM cores as it seems like a lot of the server market and maybe even windows pushes into the ARM Space, AMD just wants to get a piece of that cake too independent of the ISA.  >As an Arm design, it's likely to incorporate a big.LITTLE architecture  Interesting wording, lets see how Videocardz (which seems to be the primary source for this) comments it:  >Earlier leaks described the chip as featuring 2 P-cores and 4 E-cores. It reportedly integrates four RDNA 3.5 compute units \[...\]  Interesting, if this is a small AMD CPU, do we have any Comparison? Ohh yes, there is Kraken Point with 3+3C and 4 RDNA3.5 CUs, so if AMD just applies the same philosophies to their ARM IP (of which they likely have their own cores) which they have applied to Zen 5, we wont see a true big.LITTLE, but just a performance.COMPACT layout which is different from the usual ARM structure of actually changing the core. So I dont know if I am missing something here, but I dont see how this is any more likely to have a big.LITTLE architecture than any other recent client AMD CPU released.  >This computing power is designed to operate within a 10 W TDP power envelope, meeting the demand for extended gaming sessions on battery power alone.  Gaming on 4 RDNA3.5 CUs will be, ""ok"", wont be anything great, and the 10W TDP is also not that low. If we look again at the Ryzen AI 340 which has a similar layout this chip can already play on 10W, and chips like the 8840U as found in the GPD can already game on a 10W power cap. And with indie-games those chips might consume only \~5W, so it isnt really that impressive.  The question is if AMD can get their idle/office use power draw for these chips below \~2W and standby power draw to almost nil. 10W TDP isnt anything new for gaming on AMD chips. Especially because the Steam Decks Van Gogh (which I wouldnt use for comparison because it is a very old chip) games in the same \~10W since forever.  Also just imagine if we put Kraken Point on N3E or something, the cTDP of AMD currently goes as low as 15W on N4P (even though OEMs can introduce custom power limits). If we shrunk it to N3E, and put the CPU into a 2+4 config we could see how a roughly 10W lower cTDP is not really that far off.    So yeah, next-gen APU goes as low as 10W, shocking.

AMD,njluhau,"I think both options are possible.  On the one hand: Why would AMD go through the effort of creating a ARM core or repurposing a Zen architecture (I'd suspect it be Zen 6) just for a niche product, also AMD probably has good experience building ARM APUs, from their cooperation with Samsung.  On the other hand: AMD has good experience with ARM and invested into custom designs in the pre-Zen time, they already have all the design capabilities and a strong CPU-Architecture they could share many structures with. And they can only win with (semi)custom CPUs anyways. I dont think they can gain the edge in Servers (which is most likely the long-term-goal), with default ARM cores which the Hyperscalers could just license themselves. AMD doesnt need to ""practice"" building chips, they have all the experience.  I think the PPA of something like Zen 6 on N3 isnt to bad compared to ARMs big cores. The X925 or C1-Ultra aren't particularly small. The only question is if AMD can solve idle power draw and performance-efficiency, but that is something they have to solve either way, especially to keep the x86 data center moat healthy. Additionally I dont think these cores are suited for server, so if AMD wants to share knowledge as heavy as they do it with Zen, this might not be a good investment.  So yes while it might is attractive and much simpler to go with ARM based core IP I think for the long term goal it might not be so beneficial, as they are going up against Nvidia+MediaTek who have access to the same IP, so if AMD offers nothing different it will be interesting where they believe they have the edge.

AMD,njg3ksb,"RISC-V didn't exist in the 90s and x86 marketshare hasn't ever been this low.  You are conflating RISC and RISC-V (which didn't exist until around 2010). As a historical aside, RISC was winning until Intel's EPIC/Itanium resulted in major RISC systems like HP-RISC and Alpha were shut down and the CEOs of the rest got scared and left the market. If EPIC had not happened, RISC would likely have taken over back then.  On the RISC front, all three big ARM cores beat x86 in performance, performance per watt, and performance per watt per area (the three key metrics).  Qualcomm is shipping tons of ARM-based laptops whatever you feel about them. Apple's ARM computers make up some 15% of the PC market in the US. MS recent Windows 10 security update situation has turned 200M+ laptops into E-waste overnight. At the same time, Apple's rumored A19 macbook is supposed to be hitting the market for even less than the M1 Macbook (which is often selling for $600 or less). We could see ARM/RISC marketshare jump yet again in a huge way.  On the server side, the money saved from using something like Graviton instead of x86 are way too much to ignore. There's a peak performance price to be paid (not that it matters most of the time), but Graviton 5 (Neoverse V3) should be extremely close to Zen5 performance levels which will drive RISC adoption even further.  RISC-V is a different story to other RISC because it is open.  Open means guaranteed compatibility, better free-market pricing of licensed cores and cheaper core development costs (eg, Qualcomm paying many billions per year to ARM who does nothing but own the ISA). This in turn means cheaper chips and devices for consumers.  We've already seen the first casualties in the embedded market. All the new chip designs are RISC-V (the smallest 32-bit RISC-V cores are smaller than something like 6502 IIRC). ARM has essentially ceded the market and refocused on phone/server because they know it's a lost cause. Even AMD has  RISC-V designs for their FPGA department.  This goes beyond the MCU market too. All Western Digital harddrives ship with multiple RISC-V cores inside. All Nvidia GPUs ship with RISC-V. Apple is supposedly replacing its 20+ 64-bit Chinook soft cores per chip with cheaper RISC-V alternatives. Samsung is shipping RISC-V cores everywhere they can too. In short, if you buy a brand-new PC, it probably has more RISC-V cores than x86 cores inside.  There are big RISC-V cores too. Big server/AI cores like Ventana Veyron 2 or Ascalon exist and are wider than x86 cores. SiFive 800-series cores seem to have higher IPC than something like Zen2-3 and they aren't even that big. It has become blatantly obvious that something about x86 makes it very hard to create wider, slower, more efficient core designs (6-wide Golden Cove spiked power levels into the stratosphere and 2x4 Zen5 decoders require massive complexity).  The elephant in the room is software compatibility, but Apple has proven that you can get good enough performance to support all that ancient x86 software flawlessly while newer software is generally being written in managed languages (Java, JS, C#, etc) or being designed with multiple ISAs in mind.  All the chip companies want to be in the server/PC market and now it is finally possible for them to compete. I see zero evidence that the x86 moat will continue. AMD already designed ARM versions of some of their cores and chose not to release (probably because they felt it would open the floodgates). Intel has far closer ties to RISC-V and a hybrid x86+RISC-V chip could make them a ton of money. The first one of them to cave and design such a chip (and get all the related x86 to RISC-V patents) will gain a guaranteed 20 year stream of legacy support. It'll be interesting to see what happens.",hardware,2025-10-14 13:43:23,7,Neutral,Fear,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9240039, 'word': 'R', 'start': 0, 'end': 1}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.931041, 'word': '##C', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6405118, 'word': 'V', 'start': 5, 'end': 6}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87901556, 'word': 'x', 'start': 35, 'end': 36}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4405247, 'word': 'RISC', 'start': 98, 'end': 102}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.94053257, 'word': 'R', 'start': 107, 'end': 108}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6923121, 'word': '##ISC', 'start': 108, 'end': 111}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.50713825, 'word': 'V', 'start': 112, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99809974, 'word': 'R', 'start': 177, 'end': 178}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92028725, 'word': '##ISC', 'start': 178, 'end': 181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99830127, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 200, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.3966536, 'word': 'EP', 'start': 208, 'end': 210}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5496598, 'word': '##IC', 'start': 210, 'end': 212}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.65950423, 'word': 'It', 'start': 213, 'end': 215}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.49561048, 'word': 'R', 'start': 239, 'end': 240}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9968464, 'word': 'HP', 'start': 257, 'end': 259}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9295904, 'word': 'RISC', 'start': 260, 'end': 264}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99417925, 'word': 'Alpha', 'start': 269, 'end': 274}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.95022285, 'word': 'EP', 'start': 350, 'end': 352}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9967206, 'word': 'R', 'start': 373, 'end': 374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90619755, 'word': '##ISC', 'start': 374, 'end': 377}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.955863, 'word': 'R', 'start': 426, 'end': 427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6595335, 'word': '##IS', 'start': 427, 'end': 429}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6792783, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 452, 'end': 454}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.985105, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 570, 'end': 577}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8962388, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 598, 'end': 600}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99804354, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 646, 'end': 651}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.49382603, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 654, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9983034, 'word': 'US', 'start': 709, 'end': 711}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7897168, 'word': 'MS', 'start': 713, 'end': 715}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9937102, 'word': 'Windows 10', 'start': 723, 'end': 733}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9964281, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 827, 'end': 832}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8629978, 'word': 'Macbook', 'start': 918, 'end': 925}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7063826, 'word': 'G', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1097}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.66251767, 'word': 'x', 'start': 1116, 'end': 1117}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.85522336, 'word': 'G', 'start': 1236, 'end': 1237}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.59936875, 'word': '##ton 5', 'start': 1241, 'end': 1246}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.943273, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1290, 'end': 1293}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.81914634, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1331, 'end': 1332}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5458165, 'word': '##IS', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1334}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.75066084, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1360, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6265675, 'word': '##ISC', 'start': 1361, 'end': 1364}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9779463, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1398}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.70873827, 'word': '##ISC', 'start': 1398, 'end': 1401}]",Tópico 4

AMD,njhja9s,"> Intel has far closer ties to RISC-V and a hybrid x86+RISC-V chip could make them a ton of money.  Intel has none whatsoever ties to RISC(-V), that's nonsense … Intel actively avoids/fights anything RISC.  Intel back then *was* in fact involved into Berkley's newer RISC-prodigy and RISC-V wonder child *SiFive*, yes indeed. Though there's a story to it, and it's not how it looks!  Yes, Intel somehow managed to plant their mole at the top of it as their very CEO in 2017 (long-standing Intel-lifer infamous Naveed Sherwani), which was even before throwing some twenty-something millions at it through *Intel&nbsp;Capital* in SiFive's latest Series C-funding round in 2018, and even managed to get so far into post a (hostile) take-over bid in 2021.  Yet that hostile take-over luckily didn't even proceeded to the stage of actually happening, since Intel in their infamous arrogance blew the whistle way too early on, about what Santa Clara's intention were with SiFive afterwards, and it immediately blew up in Intel's face, all buy-out plans were cancelled by SiFive's obviously sane share-holders and their former corrupt (Intel-)CEO got rightfully ousted – Thank God for that! ❤️‍🩹  Since what Intel \*actually\* tried to do, was nothing short of outright **destroy** SiFive as long as it was still small (*""Kill it, before it can lay eggs!""*) as a direct competitor and the RISC-based threat to Santa Clara's x86.  Intel never had the intention to dip their toes into SiFive's RISC-V, never mind suddenly having a interest into anything remotely RISC-based per se. So all the whole story actually was about, was to extinguish a arising (RISC-) threat, before it becomes a actual problem and too costy to deal with (talking about bribes).  Intel hates everything non-x86 and others with a almost manic passion and especially has a problem with RISC and ARM in general, so there was never a chance for Intel being even remotely interested into suddenly trying to 'follow the market' with RISC(-V) for some monetary success. *That's NOT how Intel works*.  In Intel's view, Intel alone dictates the market – Everyone has to follow, or just die. Everyone opposing such ruling, has to be eventually extinguished, no questions asked, because Santa Clara ruled so. That's especially relevant to anyone opposing or even remotely threatening x86 as the mainstream-platform.  So their whole SiFive-entanglement had no other intended outcome, but to kill SiFive right away anyway, and with that basically plain extinguish everything **RISC-V as a whole** quickly, in a single run, for just peanuts.  Also, many industry-analysts and the informed people already called it a (tried) hostile take-over from the moment it got announced, just to take SiFive behind the barn *as is* immediately afterwards.   Doing that by then, was something Intel painfully missed to do with ARM, when Intel had ""the chance to do so"" and when British *Acorn Computers* (then Acorn RISC Machines/Advanced RISC Machines Ltd., Arm Ltd.) was still young and small back then … until it became the costy problem Intel fought for years in the mobile space, wasting $12–15Bn for helplessly trying to fight ARM-powerhouses like Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek and others aka the myriad of ARM-licencees in tow since.  ---- Though it's highly likely, that any whatsoever take-over or subsidiary-talks wouldn't've even proceeded in light of any anti-trust vetoes anyway.

Yes, their prominent K12, which was the main-design Jim Keller was working on, mind you! … and Jim Keller recently even kind of cussed AMD out for throwing it into their backyard and proverbial drawer, in Zen's favor.  The irony is, that AMD's K12-to-be, had actually about a ⅓ *higher* IPC than Zen-prototypes back then.  Anyway, AMD had to decide and took the rather easier path to pursue and refine Zen's x86-nature for a proper comeback (to finally deal Intel some heavy hairy cuts to their budget), and AMD did a fantastic job in that regard.  Though rest assured, that AMD did **not** kill nor bury anything of their ARM-derived K12!   *Sure enough, a while ago some engineering-sample surfaced in some mysterious GeekBench-listing* …  You can be certain, that AMD internalized one crucial thing under Su with K12/Zen and since anything Bulldozer;  > *»No enterprise is more likely to succeed, than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.«*   — Niccolo Machiavelli  So AMD is most definitely sneakily working in utter secrecy on some K12-derived ARM-design, for prepping up a Zen-like majorly potent ARM-architecture, to eventually (over-)take the market by storm (again, this time using ARM), when the time is just right …  That is to be understood as: *When Intel is weak and has become irrelevant enough, to NOT actually be able to interfere*, thus as soon as Intel can't do anything about it nor can't pay their beloved OEMs anymore, to corrupt the Userland and taint the market again (as Santa Clara always did from the get-go), to again prevent actual *natural* competition and the survival of the actually best platform the market actually decides upon.  Also keep in mind, that it was of all things AMD, who laid the foundation for ARM-designs in the server-space and brought the successful fore-runner of Amazon's Graviton, releasing their ARM&nbsp;Cortex&nbsp;A57-based SoCs as the ARM *Opteron A11xx*-series (*Seattle*) when Amazon didn't actually wanted it (only for Amazon to lengthy develop their own ARM-based Graviton-cores afterwards, when buying up their now subsidiary Annapurna Labs instead).  So AMD has plenty of expertise with ARM and did already a whole lot of basic ground-work – Intel has nothing of it, never invented anything ARM and on top of that, tossed every bit of ARM-expertise when ousting DEC's former ARM-personnel of StrongARM™ while ditching everything StrongARM/XScale to Marvell&nbsp;Technology in 2006 …  AMD is well-prepared for ARM, Intel is NOT and actively avoided anything ARM out of principle – *Their holy cow x86*.",hardware,2025-10-14 16:45:10,-1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9946887, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 2, 'end': 5}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.98756963, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 23, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.86811644, 'word': 'K', 'start': 165, 'end': 166}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.9987992, 'word': 'Jim Keller', 'start': 196, 'end': 206}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99877155, 'word': 'Jim Keller', 'start': 239, 'end': 249}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99147046, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 279, 'end': 282}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9376581, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 349, 'end': 352}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99366134, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 382, 'end': 385}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9362919, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 440, 'end': 443}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9963494, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 475, 'end': 478}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.94987273, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 546, 'end': 549}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.71772796, 'word': 'x', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975547, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 602, 'end': 607}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9950838, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 652, 'end': 655}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9932163, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 719, 'end': 722}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7560694, 'word': 'ARM', 'start': 767, 'end': 770}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.3612249, 'word': 'Gee', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8132523, 'word': '##B', 'start': 868, 'end': 869}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9937067, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 911, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86220556, 'word': 'Bulldo', 'start': 987, 'end': 993}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.8615673, 'word': 'Ni', 'start': 1116, 'end': 1118}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.70141345, 'word': '##cco', 'start': 1118, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.76807934, 'word': '##lo Machia', 'start': 1121, 'end': 1130}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9906635, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1140, 'end': 1143}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9890865, 'word': 'K', 'start': 1205, 'end': 1206}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.57083404, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1217, 'end': 1219}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9936115, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1247, 'end': 1250}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.750684, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1271, 'end': 1273}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9365661, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1359, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99089736, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1431, 'end': 1436}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99251634, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1534, 'end': 1539}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7168159, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1595, 'end': 1596}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87702954, 'word': 'Amazon', 'start': 1985, 'end': 1991}]",Tópico 5

Casually updating it will likely break it, and then you need to get good at reading python errors.  ComfyUI also has aspects of this, mainly with custom nodes that only work in very specific setups and node installations that can destroy your existing installation. There are users (some will know who I talk about) that spam github with ads for paid products that do this.  WanGP is IMHO the most stable one for trying out new models, because the guy behind it puts a lot of energy into it, and you can update it casually, but it has few features and the recent installation download is broken out of the box, so you again have to tinker.

AMD,nisn6e9,The reason console companies went with AMD was because AMD was on its way to bankruptcy so console makers got a fire sale on the PS4 and Xbox One chips. After that it became more difficult for those 2 companies to leave AMD due to backwards compatibility. Apparently Intel was driving a good bargain for Sony for the PS6 but don't declined because of backwards compatibility issues.

AMD,njcq04n,"Consoles are almost always targeting a 4k output (as opposed to many PC players who are playing on a 1440p monitor). The only GPUs that can currently handle path tracing in Cyberpunk at 60 fps with performance upscaling (1080p to 4k) and no frame generation are the 4090 and 5090 (see the 5080 getting under 50 fps in that scenario in the first part of [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIk7gad4GB8)). That's a $1000 GPU.  I think that in order for a PS6 game to support path tracing, at least one of the following will be true:  - The path tracing is sub 60 fps.  - It renders at sub 1080p. I think the PS6 will support high-quality upscaling, but I think sub 1080p to 4k is still too aggressive of upscaling. I think at that point, you're probably better off using cheaper rendering techniques at a higher resolution.  - The path tracing is very compromised. For instance, Alan Wake 2's path-tracing mode [sometimes doesn't use path tracing for certain things](https://youtu.be/tXfwvohROPA?t=886), and the bounce count can be configured to be as low as 1 (it falls back to baked lighting, which it can get away with because there is no day/night cycle).  - It's a low-poly game (e.g., Minecraft RTX or Quake II RTX). I personally would love if developers started to release games like this.  - The PS6 is ridiculously expensive for a console.  - The PS6 makes even larger performance gains than I expect (and I expect it to make very substantial performance improvements with ray tracing).  -------------------------------------  In past, I've guessed that the PS6 gen will be a gen that (after a cross-gen period), most games will substantially use ray tracing at 60 fps (e.g., an RTGI system and reflections).

AMD,njfsvjk,"*""...it'll have to rely on NRC and other optimizations to lower samples per pixel as ReSTIR is just not feasible rn. Too demanding.""*  Read it again.  Yes indeed, but that's ReSTIR PT which is pretty much 2020 tech.       Stuff will get better. Neural encoding will replace shader code and data encoding for many aspects, we already see that with NRC, Neural appearance models, importance sampling, AMD's GATE and their Neural Visibility cache. This is only the beginning. Stuff will run faster and look much better.  Intel also used Histogram Stratification to massively boost image fidelity compared to ReSTIR. So far NVIDIA has only used NRC to massively boost accuracy, they haven't used it with a leaner input. That's the entire point of all these technologies to lean the input and boost  the output. NVIDIA has chosen eye candy but assuming people are fine with ReSTIR PT fidelity it'll get a lot faster in the future.  PS6 HW is entirely unknown, but from what I can gather from available patents rn, there's massive foundational changes to completely overhaul the RT pipeline. This is a much bigger deal than 40 or 50 series, it's on a whole new level. So it could actually end up near a 5090 in PT processing efficiency. and not this is not me mindlessly copying what MLID said, this is based on analysis of the patents, but it does assume that AMD pushes it hard and doesn't use the increased HW efficiency to cut back on silicon investment.  1. Depends on how heavy it is. ReSTIR PT sure, something else I don't think so.  2. Can't see why that's an issue if the upscaler is another DLSS 3.7 -> DLSS 4 leap in fidelity. AMD talked about larger tiles in video and I've done some digging and this is a huge deal for the CNN stage of FSR5. When Huynh said more capable that's prob an understatement. And there's a lot of other stuff in the pipeline they can leverage. HW will be much more capable than RDNA 4, they could use enhanced data formats to make INT4 and FP4 viable for upscalers and neural rendering (MLPs).  3. Yes which is why neural rendering has to be leveraged. Raw PT is impossible but neurally augmented PT sure.  4. 100% stylized voxel or low quality asset games are basically made for PT. I hope to see some excellent games using this during PS6 era.  5. Yeah that could happen and I don't think that's neccesary. All that matters is HW sophistication for RT like I discussed prev.    \- Meanwhile AI will gobble up NAND, wafers and DRAM and push prices to the stratosphere. DRAM and NAND Inventories and waiting period are rapidly deteriorating. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets as bad for both as during crypto bubble. So 4x price jump on NAND and DRAM. This will pretty much destroy PS6 gen unless Sony can find a clever workaround (Native default injection of neural asset compression for games stored).  6. This will happen, like I said the RT in patents is bonkers.

AMD,njkrjug,"I'm sure that path tracing and denoising algorithms will improve, allowing developers to get away with using fewer rays. However, there are limits to how much it can improve, and improvements may introduce tradeoffs (e.g., aggressive reuse of data from previous frames introducing ghosting).  >So it could actually end up near a 5090 in PT processing efficiency.  If by PT processing efficiency, you mean performance adjusted for transistor count and clock speeds, then I would agree that the PS6 may well offer PT processing efficiency near a 5090. Maybe the PS6 would even offer _better_ PT processing efficiency than a 5090. If by ""PT processing efficiency"" you mean performance, then...  Console GPUs are usually lower-mid tier GPUs. For instance, the GPU in the PS5 is roughly equivalent to the RX 6700 (same architecture, same number of CU, but the RX 6700 is clocked ~10% higher). That had an MSRP of $479 at launch, between the launch MSRP of the 9060XT and 9070. The PS5 will almost certainly use AMD's upcoming RDNA5/UDNA architecture. If that history tells us where on the RDNA5/UDNA stack the PS6's GPU will be, and it keeps the same naming scheme as RDNA4, the the PS6 will likely have a GPU between the 10060 XT and 10070.  I have no doubt that the overhaul the RT pipeline will offer great RT improvements, but for a 10060 XT/10070 to have PT performance around that of the 5090, AMD will need to make architectural improvements for RT that not only match Nvidia, but greatly leapfrog the RT/PT architectural efficiency of Nvidia's 50 series.",hardware,2025-10-15 05:45:15,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.564046, 'word': 'PT', 'start': 337, 'end': 339}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92409915, 'word': 'PT', 'start': 370, 'end': 372}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9072538, 'word': 'PS6', 'start': 493, 'end': 496}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.63470054, 'word': 'PT', 'start': 512, 'end': 514}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8489168, 'word': 'PS6', 'start': 560, 'end': 563}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.83428717, 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 767, 'end': 770}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.969886, 'word': 'R', 'start': 800, 'end': 801}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96184134, 'word': 'R', 'start': 855, 'end': 856}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8160293, 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 976, 'end': 979}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9474635, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1006, 'end': 1009}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.80655235, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1021, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5842986, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1084, 'end': 1085}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.5107897, 'word': 'U', 'start': 1090, 'end': 1091}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.71189535, 'word': 'PS6', 'start': 1105, 'end': 1108}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.48252398, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1163, 'end': 1164}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.49032956, 'word': '##4', 'start': 1167, 'end': 1168}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8155612, 'word': 'PS6', 'start': 1178, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5117171, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1276, 'end': 1277}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5511223, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1305, 'end': 1306}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9669186, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1398}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.45090473, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1448, 'end': 1449}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.3642192, 'word': 'N', 'start': 1471, 'end': 1472}]",Tópico 4

Analytical is just not good enough.  It'll all be neurally enhanced. Some of it might be replaced entirely such as direct illumination: [https://arxiv.org/html/2506.05930v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.05930v2), Look at how close the result is to offline PT ground truth.  No I actually mean a 9070-9070XT tier GPU being capable of a PT processing speed (subpart of entire frame, not the entire frame) at the level of a RTX 5090.  I know this sounds completely mental, but here's some potential patent changes I can highlight   1. Quantized ray tracing, using tiny parallel (multiple times smaller than current) and very wide (BVH8-16) integer intersection testers to mass cull triangles, primitives and bounding boxes. Multiple to several times more intersections per area, that's independent of N4 -> N3P BTW.   2. Ray coherency sorting by object, triangle cluster and TLAS nodes. By doing this all rays tested against one point in the BVH are processed together massively reducing load on the memory system. This is the holy grail of ray tracing. Ray coherency sorting is much more impactful than NVIDIA's thread coherency sorting (AMD will have this too).   3. Delayed Any Hit evaluation with subsequent global sort across Shader engine to ensure unpredecented SIMD occupancy. This will smoke NVIDIA's shader execution reordering.   4. Global sorting unit that can arrange payloads to maximize data locality once again reducing divergence and cache memory load. Applicable for all parts of the RT pipeline in theory.   5. Shared ray/edge inside/outside testing eliminating duplicative tests.   6. Dedicated BVH ray traversal pipeline like Intel and NVIDIA.  Addional changes.   7. Native DGF decompression and a fallback method called prefiltering nodes that can prob work by default in all mesh shaded games.   8. Linear swept spheres, OMM support and SER support.   9. Fast Displaced micro maps that can evaluate 64 triangles as only 14 triangles reducing traversal steps to just one.   10. Streaming wave coalescer matching 50 series SER that doesn't require developer work unlike SER.  This is not even exhaustive. There's more stuff.  50 series has a mediocre RT implementation in comparison.  Think the consensus amongst the best leakers is 9070-9070XT raster.  Agreed which is exactly what I described above.

AMD,ni2qner,"Ok, here's how to think about the recent Nvidia and AMD deals with openAI:  Nvidia deal: basically Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for a portion of the GPU purchases with stock.  It works like this: for every $10B of Nvidia GPU that openAi buys, Nvidia invests something like $6B (iirc) back in openAI, buying their stock.  This means effectively $4B of the purchase is in cash and $6B is in stock.  AMD deal: openAI buys full price but gets AMD stock as rebate.  The deal is almost like an employee compensation plan.  Every GPU purchased earns openai a stock award.

The AMD deal works for AMD because their stock price is relatively low and they need to jump start purchases of their ai hardware.  It works for openai because they get a rebate effectively and a Nvidia alternative to diversify supply risk.

AMD,ni4qjhy,"Nvidia didn't actually throw $100B at OpenAI.  It's basically a invest as you go deal with a ceiling of $100B.  Basically, for every $1 of GPU purchase by OpenAI, Nvidia buys $0.6 of stock from OpenAI, so in essence Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for 60% of its purchase in stock and the rest in cash.  Recall that Nvidia's gross margin on their GPUs are about 70% and even their net profit margin is about 55%  So even on a cash basis Nvidia is still revenue positive on the GPUs it will sell to open ai, while it gets rewarded handsomely in openAI stock.  If the deals DO reach the announced $100B value, it will have meant that openAi would have found enough revenue to meet its most optimistic projections, in which case NVIDIA's stock purchase would be worth a fortune.  From both company's perspective this is a win win.  Where's the downside?  The downside is the extra planned production capacity, which is being shouldered by Nvidia and TSMC.  TSMC is actually carrying significant counterparty risk in these deals because both the Nvidia and the AMD deals translate to larger planned buys that may not materialize.  It's TSMC that has to build the physical factories to make all the chips, and they have to do so ahead of projected demand.  That mean they have to treat these large projected buy numbers as ""real"" or risk failing their customers.  On the other hand they know that the upper range of these numbers have got to be BS, but where to place their bets?  TSMC is probably actually happy for Intel foundry and Samsung to soak up some of the projected demand so they are not alone in carrying the risk of over building manufacturing capacity.",hardware,2025-10-06 20:30:01,14,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9936094, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 0, 'end': 6}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84632605, 'word': 'OpenAI', 'start': 38, 'end': 44}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9840593, 'word': 'OpenAI', 'start': 155, 'end': 161}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99436754, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 163, 'end': 169}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9652057, 'word': 'OpenAI', 'start': 194, 'end': 200}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98167664, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 216, 'end': 222}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99604654, 'word': 'Open AI', 'start': 230, 'end': 237}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99097586, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 313, 'end': 319}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9792595, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 434, 'end': 440}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84020376, 'word': 'open', 'start': 541, 'end': 545}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7981318, 'word': 'openA', 'start': 629, 'end': 634}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.89879745, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 723, 'end': 729}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9621372, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 933, 'end': 939}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98754996, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 944, 'end': 948}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9873171, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 951, 'end': 955}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8648897, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1039, 'end': 1045}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9315059, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1054, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9461744, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 1129, 'end': 1133}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.73927736, 'word': 'BS', 'start': 1437, 'end': 1439}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9957811, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 1473, 'end': 1477}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9985026, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1509, 'end': 1514}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99856573, 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 1527, 'end': 1534}]",Tópico 4

Their fundamentals are fine for the most part, they have a valuable proprietary technology moat, aren't particularly overleveredged, are low in debt, etc. its terrible for many nvidia investors who may be depending on nvidia's stock price unrealistic current evaluation bc the stock will collapse, but a stock price catering is on its own not enough to kill a company. A stock price crash can kill a company if the company needs the investor money to invest in something to scale up production to profitable levels (nvidia is already mostly at scale so this isn't a problem), if the company is already going through a massive debt crisis/restructuring, or whatever other scenario that their revenue can't cover short term cash flow. Of course this can still wipe out irresponsible investors, but that's a different story. Hell even in the extreme unrealistic case where ai 100% dies, I think nvidia has a good chance of surviving, and even outside that, their IP and market presence is large enough that in the worst case they will be bought out, and even if that somehow fails, they're likely to be bailed out to retain any sensitive IP. If Chrysler can survive 2008, nvidia can survive the ai bubble popping  And investing in a company to buy your product isn't as dumb as it sounds at first (though I think the scale involved is a bit ridiculous.) Nvidia isnt just investing in openai to buy their products directly, they're investing in openai to scale up open ai into being a mature, reliable, and dependent Nvidia customer. This is actually pretty common among ang large industry. This is exactly how aws managed to become big so fast, they invested in random companies that weren't profitable so that they could scale up and become profitable companies that were dependent on aws, EVs do this with battery companies and vice versa, this is how most early industrial companies like JP Morgan grew, this is how telecom grew, dot com, etc. Now it pretty much guarantees a bubble, or rather it only makes sense in a bubble, since the goal is to have the people you invested in mature fast enough to survive the bubble popping and then remain dependent on you.

Being ""fair"" is not in the sense that you were putting forth where a company's stock could be deemed fairly valued based on fundamentals compared to some absolute standard or some historical average or market average.  Now you have dragged in a huge number of hidden assumptions and subjective taste, and wedded yourself by taste to a philosophy of valuation that fits poorly with the market's actual dynamical behavior.  All of this leads to confusing analysis that tends to bury rather than surface actionable insights.  Investing based on ""fundamentals"" is actually hugely complicated.  You use a simple seeming set of analyses but all of the above complexity is shoved into candidate sector selection, company selection and trade execution behaviors based on inference centered human neural network training (ie taste and intuition) combined with complex logic.    Only very few people can do that in a way that beats the market consistently after a lifetime of experience.

Percentage based performance charts for upscalers is unfortunately a very bad way of understanding what kind of performance uplift to expect.

Read this thread for a full understanding, but for a short breakdown, this bit is the most important part:  > Imagine I have Game A, B and C which can render natively at 720p at 30, 60 and 120FPS respectively and upscaling to 1440p with FSR3 and FSR4. For FSR3 on the 6600 the 1440p upscale cost is usually ~1.2ms, while for FSR4 it's ~4.3ms. This is how switching from FSR3 to FSR4 would impact the performance profile in each game:  > Game A (30FPS = ~33ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~33ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 34.2ms = 29.2FPS  >     FSR4: ~33ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 37.3ms = 26.8FPS  > Game B (60FPS = ~16ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~16ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 17.2ms = 58.1FPS  >     FSR4: ~16ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 20.3ms = 49.3FPS  > Game C (120FPS = ~8ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~8ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 9.2ms = 108FPS  >     FSR4: ~8ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 12.3ms = 81.3FPS  > On game A FSR4 gets 91.7% the performance of FSR3, on game B it gets 84% the performance of FSR3 and on game C it gets 75% the performance of FSR3.  This should explain that as your input framerate gets lower, the output framerate will be closer between FSR3 and FSR4.

AMD,nh2esb4,"I was always surprised the media didn't spend more time discussing some of the crazy launch era voltage defaults all the vendors were using. Granted with Gigabyte frying chips and ASUS frying chips plus their own motherboards honorably committing seppuku for the chipacide afterwards, there was a lot going on.  I built a system a month after AM5 launched with a 7700X and ASRock B650E Riptide Wifi motherboard. Out of the gate VSOC defaulted to 1.25v but was reported at 1.288v by ZenTimings 1.29. VDD Misc was 1.3v, and CLDO was 1.10. Currently VDD Misc defaults to 1.1v, CLDO defaults to 0.95v even when setting 6000 1:1, and now VSOC shows as red if set above even 1.23v. VSOC also now actually delivers the voltage it's set to without running above it, so either ZenTimings changed how it measures or ASRock changed its LLC setting for the VSOC rail.  Will have to finish the video later but I do wonder if Steve is factoring in the ever-mercurial voltage defaults all the vendors were using. I know ASRock personally changed and tweaked every single voltage knob & paired LLC knob that existed and was constantly changing them for the first year, and still tweaking them by year two to try and lock down the memory headaches users were having. But some of those default voltages were still nuts even when the X3D chips first launched.

Was literally only few a months ago when ASRock changed the UEFI to redline a VSOC setting above 1.23v, before then it was happy to set 1.25v with EXPO. Was only after trouble began this year did ASRock finally start getting conservative with its voltage settings, but the 9800X3D debuted last Nov.  Did finish the video.

I've tried short film style videos but I like gaming content, I like creating content in the style of  SummoningSalt, Zeltik, PokemonChallenges, Vaati. So, more info/story based.   I really enjoy motion components, once I found Resolve/Fusion, I was hooked for quite a while.   I know what you mean about fighting the system/lag. I first tried Davinci, it was on a 5500u. A middle-ground at best laptop CPU w/APU. It was always a fight for ""GPU"" errors, lag. But I'm thankful that it taught me optimizations.   Transitioned to a 6700k pretty quickly with a 1660ti and felt like I was on a spaceship compared. I saved up a bit and had planned to go AM5, but 14600k dropped in price, keeping DDR4 seemed like a nobrainer, pretty budget oriented. Got mine new for about 150USD, with 5 year warranty. I recently got in a better position with work (promotion) but it's consuming my free time which is another reason I don't need a crazy GPU currently and am content waiting.   I still spend free time learning Resolve and watching videos from CaseyFarris who I'm extremely thankful for.   Either way, to reply better now that I've had some coffee...   If you are absolutely set on picking up a GPU right now with 400USD as the budget, I'll speak towards being in the US. A used 3080/ti would probably fit the bill and still allow some wiggle for a PSU, which the higher end 30 series is hungry. A 4070 could also probably be had. But my local used has them around 400, may as well skip to a new 5070 for that price though. That would get you moving currently. Then could potentially sell for a 5070ti Super down the road.

The fact that optiscaler was mentioned a few times made me think someone from AMD has been working with optiscaler team.   I also feel like they leaked the fsr4 INT8 version on purpose knowing the optiscaler team would snap it up and normalize it. I don't believe AMD will do any major work on the fsr4 INT8 version. What we see now is pretty much the best that  rdna 3 /2 can hope for, whilst FSR 4 FP8 will continue to evolve. Looking forward to seeing new improvements on fsr4 FP8 version in coming months.   I'm also very interested to see what afmf3 performs like. It will gain access to game information via fsr4, which will be the first. Also, the new machine learning FG will be available via driver toggle. It's a shame that Ray regeneration will need developers implementation.   It would have been good if Fabio stressed the fact that fsr 4 quality mode is bugged in some titles like wuchang and now Wukong.

AMD,njuw5wy,"Yes, I believe the ""improved upscaling"" is the  FSR4 INT8 version we see now is what rdna2/3 will get, which is ultimately still superior to fsr3 which rdna2/3 currently has officially. The FP8 version will continue to evolve and will only be at its best on rdna4 cards, which was pretty much confirmed in this interview. Rdna3/2 won't get future iterations. The more FSR4 evolves the more AI power is needed, and that will be too much for rdna3 cards and certainly rdna2.   >FSR Redstone will work on the principle of ML2CODE and won’t require AI-specific hardware features on the GPU.  ""Won't require"" means it will be able to run on non ai-specific hardware, but it doesn't mean it cannot or won't take advantage of AMDs signed ai-specific hardware. I believe the best version of the FSR redstone package will be via rdna4 GPUs.   To be honest Adam Kozal wasn't really showing much enthusiasm when talking about FSR4 coming to rdna3/2. He did more optiscaler marketing than anything regarding rdna3/2 getting official FSR4 support. His marketing was pretty much "" just use optiscaler"" to rdna2/3 users.   I could be wrong but rdna3/2 won't be getting any major changes to FSR4 INT8 version, and I don't think it matters that much because in it's current state it is still superior to anything available to those GPUs.

I'm sure, but having 128 bit of throughput instead of 64 in the IOD will surely go a long way towards helping it. Our DDR5-8400 is currently running with no more bandwidth than an i7 8700k's dual channel DDR4 from 2017, both systems being overclocked, because the IOD can only read 50% of the data that the memory bus can transfer.  Vast majority of workloads become bound by cores or by memory latency before saturating 140GB/s read. It's not really efficient to budget bandwidth for the peak workload when almost everything consumes much less. We can surely get a lot closer though, the current bottleneck is pretty ridiculous (~64GB/s read and write).  Threadripper saw good benefits going to 64c on 4-channel DDR5, which is equivelant to 16c+16c on 2-channel DDR5 - and they had a worse (early gen) memory controller plus no CUDIMM support.

Consolidating CCX's into fewer, larger blocks helps a great deal too with some classes of workloads.  > Unless they changed it in Zen 4 or 5, since the unified 8-core CCD in Zen 3 it's been a bi-directional ring bug, at least according to AMD's own slides.  They have been working on it a bit yeah. Adding shortcuts  > I'd imagine it'd have wins in some scenarios and losses in others.  I'm fairly sure it's an improvement overall, and that a large reason we don't have it now is because of chiplet size (a larger CCD wouldn't fit as many chiplets on X package size). Dropping two process nodes, it's now practical to do a 12c 48MB CCD in the size of the old 8c 32MB.  More cores/cache within a CCX offers a massively disproportionate improvement for game performance so it'd be a big hit on desktop DIY.",AMD,2025-10-16 10:55:34,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7160801, 'word': 'C', 'start': 12, 'end': 13}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.58974344, 'word': 'DD', 'start': 61, 'end': 63}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9712177, 'word': 'A', 'start': 90, 'end': 91}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9751465, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 111, 'end': 114}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9080597, 'word': 'IOD', 'start': 341, 'end': 344}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7964504, 'word': 'DD', 'start': 395, 'end': 397}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97788405, 'word': 'IOD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.3585809, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1106, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9529045, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1365, 'end': 1368}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.90568495, 'word': 'Zen 3', 'start': 1409, 'end': 1414}]",Tópico 4

AMD,ngmx0bu,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough.

I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,nd0ymaa,"Yes, I've turned off the system animations, and the blinking cursors.  There aren't settings to switch fonts, to replace thin/faint fonts with bold ones. The folks developing Windows like Segoe Ui, maybe they can read it. There are regedit hacks, but I'm not sure how to do them. There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked.

Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period.
