I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

Intel,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand.

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

OEMs at first decided to price these at Intel prices then it settled at Intel -100/200€   QC laptops still sold what QC and partners expected and OEMs are increasing new models for X2 (design wins went from 60 to 100+)   X2 has a 25% advantage vs Panther Lake and it will still be cheaper because QC is an underdog. If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029. The laptop market is VERY slow to move. AMD had a better product for several generations and it only netted them +10%   While QC and Mediatek/Nvidia don't hit a bigger marketshare number.

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

Intel,ntckb4u,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:41:27,-1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84373665), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 52, 'end': 61}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8637726), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 63, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.77772593), 'word': 'Met', 'start': 101, 'end': 104}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60526806), 'word': '##eor', 'start': 104, 'end': 107}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.8935882), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 108, 'end': 112}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.76103985), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 114, 'end': 124}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.78146845), 'word': 'Luna', 'start': 130, 'end': 134}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58814985), 'word': '##r', 'start': 134, 'end': 135}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.969792), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 136, 'end': 140}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.86424404), 'word': 'Cine', 'start': 216, 'end': 220}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7164212), 'word': '##ben', 'start': 220, 'end': 223}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7820186), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 462, 'end': 466}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9941365), 'word': 'IPC', 'start': 558, 'end': 561}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8300362), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 760, 'end': 769}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98455614), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 777, 'end': 785}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9908302), 'word': 'IPC', 'start': 820, 'end': 823}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9818982), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 894, 'end': 903}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9830823), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 962, 'end': 970}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.81780267), 'word': 'Cine', 'start': 1281, 'end': 1285}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5331536), 'word': '##ben', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1288}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6922186), 'word': '##ch', 'start': 1288, 'end': 1290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8266066), 'word': 'Cinebench', 'start': 1378, 'end': 1387}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.977803), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1446, 'end': 1454}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8220633), 'word': 'Elite', 'start': 1459, 'end': 1464}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9303264), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 1573, 'end': 1580}]",Tópico 1

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:17:12,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5722218), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 0, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.87760466), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 8, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9204128), 'word': 'BPD', 'start': 233, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9109275), 'word': 'A', 'start': 924, 'end': 925}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7746179), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 930, 'end': 935}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4222402), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 970, 'end': 972}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7283281), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1055, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975158), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7844832), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9260799), 'word': 'IP', 'start': 1177, 'end': 1179}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.60086036), 'word': 'Arrow lake', 'start': 1188, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9970722), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1248, 'end': 1253}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Once you're stable and if temps are still too high (thermal throttle) then you can reduce clock speed by 100hz and keep doing it till you're happy. Reducing by 200mhz doesn't hurt gaming performance.

Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300.

Intel,nx5jal3,"Here's a dumb question that would be absolutely ridiculed if I dared to create a whole thread around it.  Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department.

Intel,nymut0x,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",AMD,2025-11-14 05:48:36,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.86930275), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 100, 'end': 102}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.78668326), 'word': 'Ch', 'start': 371, 'end': 373}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9945775), 'word': 'Edge', 'start': 416, 'end': 420}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6136532), 'word': 'Ch', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1024}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.68942505), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1070, 'end': 1073}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9185944), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1134}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9277409), 'word': 'Firefox', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1249}]",Tópico 2

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.780761), 'word': 'YouTube', 'start': 186, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.632216), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 202, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89879507), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52583975), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 211, 'end': 213}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71377695), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 213, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56497085), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 266, 'end': 268}]",Tópico 5

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",AMD,2024-04-01 02:18:57,27,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96870226), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9156764), 'word': 'I', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9579422), 'word': 'M', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6767603), 'word': 'N', 'start': 78, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.69673014), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 79, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8865069), 'word': '##DI', 'start': 81, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98826766), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 142, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81870246), 'word': 'VFIO', 'start': 220, 'end': 224}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004071), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 270, 'end': 273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97644997), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 355, 'end': 358}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78370017), 'word': 'V', 'start': 478, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9868846), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8120332), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 637, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40551057), 'word': 'M', 'start': 679, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7868693), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 721, 'end': 727}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.657153), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 746, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99238694), 'word': 'Debian', 'start': 835, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86615694), 'word': 'Proxmox', 'start': 865, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936753), 'word': 'N', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81987095), 'word': '##utanix', 'start': 906, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9508743), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 923, 'end': 929}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9956404), 'word': 'Broadcom', 'start': 941, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9882114), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7132545), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93465674), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1279, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91439724), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658943), 'word': 'Spice', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 1

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

As it is, buying this for $800 over a used 3090 is a really hard sell. Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.

AMD,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",hardware,2026-01-11 16:53:47,5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99530303), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 10, 'end': 13}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.71971744), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 33, 'end': 36}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986958), 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 90, 'end': 94}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5870024), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 120, 'end': 122}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9838643), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 171, 'end': 174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88663596), 'word': 'St', 'start': 416, 'end': 418}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8116927), 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 422, 'end': 426}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7045092), 'word': 'SON', 'start': 431, 'end': 434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7414605), 'word': 'SONY', 'start': 518, 'end': 522}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980957), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 527, 'end': 536}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69639087), 'word': 'SONY', 'start': 827, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980106), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 835, 'end': 844}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.90673), 'word': 'PS', 'start': 1038, 'end': 1040}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76247233), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1158, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7628501), 'word': 'Desktop', 'start': 1347, 'end': 1354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.75722647), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 1359, 'end': 1365}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87763405), 'word': 'St', 'start': 1443, 'end': 1445}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8686896), 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 1449, 'end': 1453}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5764847), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1483}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9519313), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1641, 'end': 1646}]",Tópico 3

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.

AMD,nxycvko,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.

AMD,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.

AMD,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

AMD,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",hardware,2026-01-13 15:59:39,-4,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7629397), 'word': 'B31', 'start': 18, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.74527276), 'word': 'A31', 'start': 76, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7529125), 'word': 'Al', 'start': 91, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93792975), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 194, 'end': 200}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96430236), 'word': 'GTX 1650', 'start': 383, 'end': 391}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8816205), 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 520, 'end': 529}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99752444), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 596, 'end': 601}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7194059), 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 617, 'end': 627}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5586983), 'word': 'Celes', 'start': 632, 'end': 637}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7116462), 'word': '##tial', 'start': 637, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7639773), 'word': 'A31', 'start': 772, 'end': 775}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9997087), 'word': 'Australia', 'start': 829, 'end': 838}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9302061), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1243}]",Tópico 3

And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces.  My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them... Just like every new GPU uArch family does for them. TeraScale, GCN, RDNA1. Each first iteration was a mess. I'm betting they wanted to get UDNA into iGPUs a lot sooner, and launch dGPU UDNA afterward. A guess.  NV hasn't been immune to this in the past. The FX Series, Tesla, and Fermi were all either under-performers, or problematic in their first iteration.   And weirdly Blackwell had a lot of initial driver issues.

AMD,nz3ftoc,"a year would actually be quite long, Zen 5 launched July 2024. A successor two years later at least for the H2 mobiles would be nice. October/November 2026 desktop release would be reasonable and fit previous cadence, tho there are rumours about a N2X delay.  I think the biggest issue is the lack of a dGPU refresh and the non-existend RDNA4 iGPUs. RDNA5 is likely H2 2027, so sticking with RDNA 3.5 hurts. Most APUs/mobiles will only run a more modern gen starting in mid 2028, if they can even ramp enough beside some Halo SKUs, dGPU and consoles (not even counting AI-GPUs). with the current lack of FSR4 for RDNA 3.5, that's dissappointing, tho they think about backporting.  dual stacked V-cache (each CCD with 2 V-cache layers) and better memory controller/IOD would've been awesome as well.   rumours and leaks obviously had nothing on the radar, so it's not suprising nothing came from CES, but still, Lisa booked a keynote - and brought basically nothing. at last years CES they delayed RDNA4 - so it's the second disappointing keynote in a row.",hardware,2026-01-12 02:59:42,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9450102), 'word': 'Zen 5', 'start': 37, 'end': 42}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95844764), 'word': 'R', 'start': 337, 'end': 338}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.60571724), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 339, 'end': 341}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.54013866), 'word': 'R', 'start': 350, 'end': 351}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6672403), 'word': 'RDNA', 'start': 392, 'end': 396}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8683537), 'word': 'SK', 'start': 526, 'end': 528}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.831448), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 569, 'end': 571}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6924599), 'word': 'R', 'start': 613, 'end': 614}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.72735214), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 615, 'end': 617}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6620754), 'word': 'CE', 'start': 895, 'end': 897}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.9711), 'word': 'Lisa', 'start': 911, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.48154858), 'word': 'CE', 'start': 980, 'end': 982}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5687628), 'word': 'R', 'start': 997, 'end': 998}]",Tópico 3

I've seen several people post the same thing as you and here is a small list I compiled of consumer related electronics that were shown:  * Intel showed Panther Lake, which looks really nice. * Pretty much all the big laptop manufacturers showed off their next generation laptops, a lot of which seem pretty nice (a lot of focus on reparability this year). They also showed off a bunch of cool concepts like the computer-in-a-keyboard from HP, the rollable laptop from Lenovo, the dual-screen laptop from Asus. * A lot of monitor news. * A lot of PC case related stuff were shown. * IKEA has launched a bunch of matter devices for home automation as well as a 10 dollar speakers that can pair with up to 100 units. * Motorola showed off their Razr Fold phone. * Nvidia's DLSS 4.5 update seems pretty big and will work on older generations as well. * LG and Samsung both showed off new TVs. The latter showed off micro RGB. * A lot of audio-related stuff like new soundbars, wireless speakers from Samsung, Onkyo and so on. * Razer announced some gaming related stuff if that's what you care about. A new stream deck keyboard, a new controller and so on. Hyperkin also announced a modular clamp-on controller. * A robot vacuum that can climb stairs. * A bunch of car related things were announced as well, such as Ford saying L3 driving will come in 2028. * L'Oreal showed off a flat iron that uses IR light. * Asus showed off a Wi-Fi 8 router. * Lego showed off ""smart bricks"" which seems neat.  I could keep going but I think you get the point. There is a ton of stuff from CES that are consumer related. Just because you were hoping for specific things (probably gaming related) from a handful of specific companies (AMD, Intel and Nvidia) does not mean the entire show is bad or no longer about consumer electronics.

The Z1 was RDNA 3 and is used in most handhelds because, at the time in 2023, it was the best option available.  They’ve sat twiddling their thumbs after securing one win in 2023 that everyone else has caught up or surpassed them in mobile GPU efficiency and performance per watt.  Strix Halo has the same issue, the only difference they’ve done is increased memory bandwidth and increased the power.

AMD,nzawpjk,"As someone who threw a 4070 Ti Super at a 3600 and used it for a year, I'd throw in a beefy GPU like a 9070XT, 9060XT 16GB, or 5060 Ti 16GB at it *while accepting there are some newer releases out there and future releases that it will struggle with.* It may work for some people, it may not work for others. A minimum, I think it's something that everyone who is budget restricted should give a shot; especially if you're more of a patient gamer. For me, a 5700XT to a 4070 Ti Super felt like a brand new computer that didn't really need anything else.   In my case, I never actually naturally encountered a title that my 3600 couldn't run that I really wanted to play. Sure I saw some in benchmarks showing that some titles experienced sub-70FPS, but seeing it is different than actually encountering it in my natural course of gaming. Plus.. it's pretty much the same as seeing a title on PS5 or Switch that interests me, but I'll probably never play because I don't have a PS5 or Switch.  Sure some titles would also perform better than my 3600 could when paired with a 4070 Ti Super, but for the most part 90FPS or higher feels fine to me and I only have a 144hz 1440p monitor that I can't really tell the difference at between 110FPS and 144FPS. DLSS feels perfect fine and really carries the 3600 pretty far.   In all honesty, Hell Let Loose was the only title that I ever really naturally encountered that made the 3600 feel a bit tired, but by all means it was playable.   I did eventually move on to first a 5600 and then a 7600x, but that was more of a no-brainer financial decision. I found super good prices on both when prices were good ($110 on the CPU/mobo/RAM side of things after selling my old mobo/RAM/CPU). In all honesty, I couldn't personally say I've naturally encountered any game-changing improvements with either the 5600 or 7600x. Again, there definitely are some out there. Especially BF6. But you can stretch a 3600 extremely far and get great results (until you run into something that you flat out can't that's under 60FPS).   I've since played a couple games that my 3600 probably would have struggled with, but in all honesty they were titles I thought were overrated and could have lived without and that was my experience playing them.

AMD,nzxue4p,"Both AMD and Intel make great CPUs.  AMD makes the best gaming chip.  Intel makes the best productivity chip.  Intel charges more for their products,  AMD is as good or almost as good in every category, and always a better value price wise.  Intel was clearly the leader 10 years ago, but fell behind.  AMD appeared to innovate and improve with the Ryzen architecture, while Intel stagnated with Skylake and its iterations.  Intel also hit a roadblock with its foundry and had trouble shrinking the process node, while AMD outsources its production to TSMC who was quickly and efficiently making smaller, faster, cooler chips.  Intel has innovated recently with its mixed performance/efficiency core chips (similar to modern smartphones).  Intel is also on a completely new architecture (definitely some hiccups in implementation).  They’ve also adopted the chiplet manufacturing process  (about 8 years after AMD).  They are doing what they need to catch back up, but are behind AMD and are dealing with the technological challenges of rolling out a new architecture and manufacturing processes (which you could argue AMD/TSMC already dealt with in the early days of the Ryzen architecture).  Despite losing market share and not keeping up with AMD, Intel continues to charge more for their chips as well as introduce a new socket every other year.  Hence AMD is cheaper, and in many cases an upgrade is just updating the BIOS and dropping a new chip in.  Whereas with Intel you have to buy a new mobo every time.  There were other issue such as 13 and 14 series Intel chips frying themselves (Intel kept competitive buy pushing more power and upping the core frequency-those generation chip ran HOT).  They had to implement BIOS and micro code updates that helped keep the chips from frying themselves, but also reduced performance.  At the same time, Microsoft released a patch that fixed a scheduler issue which was affecting AMD processors and boosted performance in many games (be wary of AMD reviews from before the Windows 24H2 update).  For GPUs I think NVIDIA still has the better products especially at the top end.  At the midrange and lower tiers they are still putting out cards with 8 and 12 GB of VRAM which are not aging well with Games and monitors pushing 1440p and 4K graphics.

AMD,nzy9m19,"Intel fell from grace back around 2010.  Intel had too many sockets, problematic releases, poor support, poor performance, and were frankly overpriced.  AMD came in showing strong competition in the 2000s, but then really stepped it up with the Ryzen era chips in the mid 2010s.  At that point, AMD was putting out CPUs that were straight up better, and cheaper, while being better for home use.  While AMD is still a step or two behind Nvidia for graphics, they are a strong competitor at this point.  AMD used to have driver issues, support issues, stability issues, etc.  The shift here happened around the same time as their gains in the CPU department.  The mid 2010s were a major turning point for AMD GPUs.  Comparative FPS rates, cheaper prices.  My previous builds going back 27 years have all been Intel/Nvidia.  My latest build all team red, and I honestly couldn't be happier.  AMD currently makes up about 43% of the CPU market share.  A lot of intel's market share is propped up by government and business PCs.  The home market is heavily swayed in AMDs favor due to price.  Nvidia is still VERY dominant in the GPU market.  AMD has less than 10% of the market share.  Nvidia pushes the top end harder than AMD does, which then gives them clout.  They also offer a more robust low end offering than AMD.

So yeah, although I have sworn off giving my money to Nvidia, you should know that they have some pretty impressive improvements coming their cards very soon.  AMD is still excellent though, drivers are stable these days and you can get the infamous 12VHPWR cable that has almost no built in system to detect if it is drawing all of its power through a single pair of pins.

AMD,nzvzcz3,"You cannot go wrong with an x3D AMD chip.  Current GPUs (highest to lowest performance)  Current AMD GPUs: 9070XT, 9070, 9060 XT  Current Nvidia GPUs: 5090, 5080, 5070 TI, 5070, 5060 TI, 5060, 5050  Intel GPUs do exist and they are surprisingly good, and inexpensive. I just feel as if they may not be the best recommendation due to compatibility issues. I.e, I used an Intel GPU for my dad's office PC (he likes to use multiple high res monitors and was interested in being able to play some games potentially, but not a main focus) but I probably wouldn't choose to use it in a gaming specific build. Intel GPUs are not always capable of running older titles. AMD or Nvidia would probably provide a more seamless experience right now.  Currently if it was me building right now, I would lean away from Intel CPUs. Intel's new CPU line (panther lake) is supposed to come out within the next 12 months or so.. the new line looks very enticing but we have to wait for actual performance testing and benchmarks. If you aren't planning to build for another year-ish, maybe check that out because they look really good. In the meantime, with AMDs x3D chips you basically know you are getting a best in slot gaming CPU, so I would go with that.  GPUs are not how they used to be. Low/mid grade GPUs are nearly extinct being $400-500 or more. Recently there have been  more options in the sub $400 range. The 5060 or 5050 are closer to the $300 range. Any current gen GPU that you buy will run any game.. it just may not run it at max settings with super high fps. Even the cheapest amd/Nvidia GPU should run any game. I would probably get a GPU with at least 12gb of vram just to be safe.. but I think they have mostly done away with 12gb variants so you may have to go to 16gb.  Hell, you could get a 9800x3D and run the integrated graphics on it and that will run most games.. just maybe not with great fps or quality. I know cs2 for example, you can get almost 60 fps with the 9800x3D integrated graphics.. but on more demanding games like cyberpunk you are looking at single digits of fps. Still get a dedicated GPU.. I was just making a broader point of how much things have changed.  Personal take: I cannot stand Nvidia/GeForce experience. I will fully admit that I have had instability problems with my 7900xtx drivers with the AM5 platform but I will take that any day over GeForce experience. Never had a stability issue on AM4. I chose a 7900XTX over a 4090 for that specific reason. For anyone curious, my 7900XTX is a high bin card which I did benchmarking with to compare to my friends 4090 FE. Timespy score was basically the same.. although his GPU specific score was roughly 12% higher. I can post the benchmarks if anyone wants  TLDR; if you are going to overspend on anything, get the 9800x3D... 7800x3D if you need to save some cash.. it's still an amazing CPU. Get a dedicated GPU with at least 12gb of vram. If you need a hard budget, an 8gb budget card can get you by. The only reason I suggest 12 or more is so you have more options for higher end games or higher resolution monitors.. plus 12gb+ of vram will age a bit better than 8.",buildapc,2026-01-16 08:39:04,3,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82467175), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 370, 'end': 375}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.77134025), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 662, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.57285744), 'word': 'N', 'start': 669, 'end': 670}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96924543), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 804, 'end': 809}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99754435), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 816, 'end': 821}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nzwyz52,"AMD and Nvidia graphics cards are both good when talking about current gen AMD graphics cards, and Nvidia is still typically more popular, though discrete AMD graphics cards have been selling unusually well this generation. Pricing has fluctuated a lot this generation too, with prices and availability being quite poor earlier this year when the new products first launched, but with prices going to MSRP or even below for a few months at the end of last year. Prices are now rising quite rapidly again, so I would not wait too long before getting something. Generally speaking, models with 16GB of vram have been the best value options, IF you can afford them. With what's happening with prices currently, the RTX 5070 might also be worth considering. It doesn't have a lot of vram for the price, but if it's one of the only cards still available for MSRP, it might be a good value.   Assuming MSRP pricing, or pricing that's equally proportional to MSRP pricing (with all cards being an equal percentage above MSRP), the 9060 XT (16GB), 5060 ti (16GB), RX 9070, RX 9070 XT, and RTX 5070 ti are all good options at each respective price point.   Gigabyte cards have had issues with ""thermal gel migration"". This might only be affecting cards which aren't mounted in a horizontal orientation. Gigabyte is apparently starting to use a different type of compound to correct this issue going forward, but most cards on store shelves currently likely still have the problematic thermal gel. If components start running too hot because the thermal gel is no longer providing adequate contact with some components, the warranty should cover a fix for this.   If you're concerned, you could monitor temperatures for things like memory, and see if any of those temps ever starts going a lot higher.

AMD,nzyc8ri,"GPU  is still a war between Nvidia and AMD for the most part. But the choice boils down to preference and affordability at this point. Nvidia's GPUs are better for productivity, which your son probably doesn't need, and also it is smart of him to go with AMD GPU instead since they offer better price-performance ratio. Even then AMD GPUs are quickly catching up on productivity as well, something like streaming, so even if you son wants to stream, he can still get pretty good stream quality with the 9000 series of AMD GPUs.  CPU wise, it's a no brainer to go with AMD, since they offer insane upgradability. The AMD motherboards pretty much let you upgrade to the maximum performing CPU you can get, as long as the CPU uses the same socket. Intel and AMD CPU's in the same tier pretty much trade blows with each other the same tier, but usually Intel CPUs are more expensive than AMD when you compare the price-peformance value, so again, it makes no sense to go with Intel based on the comparison.

AMD,nzyixoo,"Nvidia is already trying to make their cheaper GPUs scarce, again. *sigh* AMD GPUs tend to offer a smoother Linux experience. For a gaming box, new, even if you plan to go with Windows right now, thinking about Linux compatibility wouldn't be a bad idea. Nvidia has their own sets of software features that either just they have, or that they do better than AMD, while AMD tends to offer a bit better value in terms of basic performance per dollar. There are pros and cons to both. Then, if you're squeezing nickels (RIP penny) in this market, there's even Intel!  While there are many fanboys willing to make excuses, Nvidias drivers haven't any kind of gold standard since we were all running 2k/XP. AMD has had perfectly fine drivers for a good while now, like 10-15 years, except for during the first few weeks after a new launch, on Windows, and a few months, on Linux (there's a lot more goin on in Linux, than just having a new driver package to download). Nvidia does do better at making their release drivers good.  CPU-wise, Intel has been playing catchup, then had a bad time with 13th and 14th gen. There has been some evidence that their fix just got the CPU degradation slow enough to get through the warranty period, too. The latest couple designs of theirs have been very good (Arrow Lake (+refresh), and Twin Lake/Lunar Lake, specifically), but they not quite topping the gaming charts, on average.  Meanwhile, since Su became CEO, AMD hasn't missed a beat, with the Ryzens. Every gen has offered at least a typical 10% uplift, at similar power to the prior gens, and offer better average gaming performance than Intel, at most price points. Zen and Zen+ were a little dodgy, but stability and reliability has been excellent, since Zen 2 and the 2nd gen of motherboard designs (many of the first-gen Ryzen boards were rushed, lazy, cheap, designs, since nobody expected AMD's new CPUs to do any better than their last 5 or 6). There also are no third-party chipsets, anymore, which mostly solved that ages-old AMD instability reputation. Then, for chart topping halo products, the X3D CPUs kick ass and take names, with ~100MB last-level cache.  At home, everything but my laptop is now Ryzen, including my home servers; and my work laptop is a Ryzen.

AMD,nzxojmt,2000 series has access to the same dlss-sr presets as the newest cards just 20/30 series will run the most recent ones just released significantly worse than 40/50. so most users of the older cards will likely stick to the dlss presets released 1 year ago which are still very solid visually but quite worse when it comes to ghosting. it is still great that they have access to those new presets though and they're leaving the option up to the user since in some games you might have the overhead or want to compare if it's worth the tradeoff.   fsr 4 is only on the 90 series at the moment. an int8 version which is able to be run on all rdna 2/3 and nvidia cards leaked several months ago and people have been able to use it unofficially through optiscaler by taking dlss inputs which are implemented in pretty much every game and then using fsr 4 as the output. it works well i've used it on steam deck personally just to mess with it. someone who wants a seamless experience prob shouldn't get amd at the moment if they want fsr 4 in everything but if they're cool with dragging some files it's very simple.,buildapc,2026-01-16 15:30:18,7,Neutral,Neutral,[],Tópico 3
AMD,nzyzva6,">but aren't old Nvidia GPUs stuck on old DLSS versions?  No, the 2000 series and up all support DLSS4, which is objectively the best implementation bar DLSS3 since it uses the transformer model instead of the older cnn.  The same can't be said about Radeon cards from the same era. FSR3 isn't as good as DLSS4 and it's even worse on older Radeon cards since most of them lack the hardware implementation Nvidia has had in their cards. FSR4, as it stands, is currently MIA from anything other than RDNA4.  So, seeing as how FSR4 is meant to compete directly with DLSS4 when we're now already onto DLSS4.5 (3000 series & up), I don't see how AMD is more backwards compatible than Nvidia. Also, consider that even DLSS3 still outperforms FSR3. That plus the lack of game dev support for FSR in many titles is why I wouldn't recommend Radeon (VR too).",buildapc,2026-01-16 18:59:05,4,Neutral,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7583159), 'word': 'N', 'start': 16, 'end': 17}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.728609), 'word': '##vid', 'start': 17, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8598099), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 41, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.792408), 'word': 'DLSS4', 'start': 96, 'end': 101}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7441175), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 152, 'end': 156}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6538567), 'word': 'Radeon', 'start': 250, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6434475), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 282, 'end': 285}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7928608), 'word': 'DLSS4', 'start': 304, 'end': 309}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8852965), 'word': 'Radeon', 'start': 339, 'end': 345}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8841903), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 404, 'end': 410}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5410787), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 435, 'end': 438}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.41551653), 'word': 'R', 'start': 497, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6784334), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 523, 'end': 526}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8605465), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 562, 'end': 566}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70292604), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 596, 'end': 600}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8907106), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 640, 'end': 642}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6395105), 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 678, 'end': 682}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69088596), 'word': 'DLSS3', 'start': 711, 'end': 716}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6471417), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 735, 'end': 738}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8350648), 'word': 'F', 'start': 784, 'end': 785}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6049912), 'word': '##SR', 'start': 785, 'end': 787}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.712632), 'word': 'Radeon', 'start': 831, 'end': 837}]",Tópico 5

Intel has never actually been that good a company, never really had that much of a perf lead as people assumed, and has often been the butt of SERIOUS security and stability problems (FDIV bug, spectre/meltdown hitting so much harder and causing massive perf losses putting them worse than post mitigation AMD chips when then initially benched ahead, etc etc).

AMD,nyti1nf,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".

AMD,nydqrhk,"Yes. This is only a problem because people talk as if X3D is black magic. It just extra L3 cache. The vertically stacked ""3D"" part is just how they're able to squeeze that more cache onto the die.  L3 cache is orders of magnitude faster than even RAM, so any time the CPU can get the data it needs from cache instead of even having to go out to RAM, you get better performance. This applies to everything a CPU does, as well, not just gaming. Gaming simply benefits greatly because, as a workload, it tends to use a lot of the same data over and over again, which means you get a lot of cache hits. A bigger cache means more data can be stored and, the chance of a cache hit versus a miss is greater, as a result. That's it. The entire secret sauce to X3D.  The reason already that the second CCD is disabled is because of the two pools of cache are separate. If a thread on CCD0 requests data, it's added to the the cache on CCD0. If a thread on CCD1 requests the same data, that's not in *its* cache, so you either call it a miss and move on or cross over the fabric to check the cache on CCD0. That instantly slows it down, though, to the point where you might as well have pulled it fresh from memory. Therefore, the way to extract the most performance is to make sure all the threads that are accessing the same cached data are using the same pool of cache, and the way you do that on a multi CCD design is to disable the other CCD.  Adding more cache to the second CCD doesn't solve this problem. The existing cache on the second CCD could already be utilized, if it made any sense to, and all that mattered was more cache overall. It just makes it so that any thread, regardless of which CCD it's on, has access to a large pool of cache. But, you would still want to confine the work for a single application entirely to one CCD to extract the most benefit. It doesn't help gaming at all.

The more area you add, the more cycles you need to wait.  Just think about it logically, take the supposition to the extreme; imagine an infinite cache, the latency would be infinite.  -----  In this case its not adding more cache to the same ccd, but to the other ccd that lacks it. There wont be any additional latency concerns, so it should be a net positive. However, for anything that sits on one ccd, its not going to help at all. On ryzen, each ccd can only write to its own caches. One ccd can not go and write to the other ccd. It can however snoop the cache of the other ccd(and it must to ensure memory coherency), but this adds cross talk over the infinity fabric.

AMD,nye82al,"You still won't want game threads crossing CCDs. The SerDes interconnect is still not fast enough, nor does it offer enough throughput for cache-cache transfers (and doesn't have this capability). All data will hit system memory if it needs to traverse another CCD. This is a significant latency hit vs V-cache, at least for first transfers. After that, data should be in both CCDs' caches, but there's not really a good way to control workloads with dependencies without locking to a single CCD. Otherwise, threads on both CCDs will stall as they wait for data from one another, traversing system memory, as all cached data is present in RAM.  Parallel ops with independent workloads can task both CCDs without much issue.  EDIT: There might be a way to optimize traffic in software, if it's intelligent and catches op dependencies from traversing CCDs. But, as usual, this has overhead and can still allow some edge cases to cross. Better to have some type of data traffic QoS than nothing though or we're back to parking the other CCD, which seems wasteful to me. Background tasks should operate on the secondary CCD at minimum.

Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,nxvyiba,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Intel,2026-01-05 21:06:54,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9291993), 'word': 'MTL', 'start': 64, 'end': 67}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.79508936), 'word': 'MTL', 'start': 211, 'end': 214}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8853798), 'word': 'ARL', 'start': 216, 'end': 219}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99774593), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 935, 'end': 940}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9979328), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1006, 'end': 1011}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9970771), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1232, 'end': 1237}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4100266), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1605, 'end': 1606}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99778736), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1698, 'end': 1703}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9951055), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 2007, 'end': 2012}]",Tópico 3

Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency. Then your CPU could have degraded.   While I used offset and set the max turbo limit.  I know how silicon works.

AMD,nxv4op7,"Okay, so we've gone right off the rails of a logical discussion. I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.

I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU.

I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.

AMD,nvbb6wv,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.

The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 2

AMD,nt12wk5,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

AMD,ntz1is6,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Intel,2025-12-14 13:04:59,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985821), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 589, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9987382), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 638, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9978817), 'word': 'Final Fantasy XI', 'start': 807, 'end': 823}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.
