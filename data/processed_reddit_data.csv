So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent.

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than. Invest in their software stack. Developing good technology and then abandoning it instead of advancing, because abandoning it is cheaper and easier is an extremely Intel move.

No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

Intel,nes030p,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power.

Intel,nery8a6,"Geekerwan's results are ***average*** power, not peak power, IIRC. These are real, actual frequency bins that Apple has allowed.  These frequency bins *will* be hit by some workloads, but just not nearly as long as SPEC & active cooling will allow. It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years. Seems like not a good compromise when you're eating more power per unit of performance.   That is, the A19 Pro on fp has skewed towards the flatter part of the perf / W curve.   >And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614332), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.604474), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.420649), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713005), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 3

Intel,nerbuxh,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",hardware,2025-07-04 02:03:25,0,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90186936), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 214, 'end': 217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86568034), 'word': 'N', 'start': 863, 'end': 864}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62983924), 'word': 'Pascal', 'start': 888, 'end': 894}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5193365), 'word': 'Titan', 'start': 1013, 'end': 1018}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7143878), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1344, 'end': 1350}]",Tópico 1

For not much more money, at around $550, you can get a 9600X, a B850 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5.   If RAM prices weren't skyrocketing like they currently are, you could have gotten a basic AM5 setup for around $450 a few weeks ago. Some of the price hike can be explained by RAM chips being purchased for AI, due to many many data centers popping up all over major cities. But also can be explained by the upcoming holiday season in a few short weeks. Its a common trend now - you can use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel or PCPartpicker to look at the pricing trend.   Its not really ideal to move to AM4, especially buying brand new parts - the cost difference is in AM5's favor even with the DDR5 price hike. Any better CPU upgrade down the line would require you to jump to a new platform anyway, which means CPU/MOBO/RAM at a minimum.   Hell, if you're willing to wait a few weeks to see what the holiday ""sales"" bring. (more people are becoming aware that a few weeks before the holiday season price hikes tend to happen so that things like Black Friday and Christmas sales make you believe you're getting a good deal)  Starting off with something like the 9600X build I listed below will give you far more longevity, and the socket itself will have 1 or 2 more CPU generations so you'll still have an upgrade path even if something like AM6 comes out.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.780761), 'word': 'YouTube', 'start': 186, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.632216), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 202, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89879507), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52583975), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 211, 'end': 213}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71377695), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 213, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56497085), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 266, 'end': 268}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",AMD,2024-04-01 02:18:57,29,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96870226), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9156764), 'word': 'I', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9579422), 'word': 'M', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6767603), 'word': 'N', 'start': 78, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.69673014), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 79, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8865069), 'word': '##DI', 'start': 81, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98826766), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 142, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81870246), 'word': 'VFIO', 'start': 220, 'end': 224}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004071), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 270, 'end': 273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97644997), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 355, 'end': 358}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78370017), 'word': 'V', 'start': 478, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9868846), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8120332), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 637, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40551057), 'word': 'M', 'start': 679, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7868693), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 721, 'end': 727}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.657153), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 746, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99238694), 'word': 'Debian', 'start': 835, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86615694), 'word': 'Proxmox', 'start': 865, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936753), 'word': 'N', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81987095), 'word': '##utanix', 'start': 906, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9508743), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 923, 'end': 929}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9956404), 'word': 'Broadcom', 'start': 941, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9882114), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7132545), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93465674), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1279, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91439724), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658943), 'word': 'Spice', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 2

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.949649), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378605), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84053415), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6853485), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 1

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.

In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread.

Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

Intel,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 2

Cache-aware scheduling is experimental even on Linux, Windows just won't catch up any soon.  - Games are incredibly sloppily written, and typically only optimized until the performance is considered good enough on the most common setups. Windows doesn't even offer tools to mitigate bad strategies like creating tons of threads beyond the point of reasonable scaling, unlike tools offered by Linux like a cgroup with only the X3D CCD being visible, or similarly Wine being instructed to limit the visibility of cores not desired to be used. Letting the game see 32 hardware threads, resulting in multiple layers of abstractions create 32 software threads each, and just confining them them to a single CCD with something like Process Lasso just doesn't compare.  - Even with a good scheduler, what's the point of having 2 higher performance CCDs for the use case of one performance sensitive task with many background tasks the user doesn't even care about much?

AMD,nkpn3ce,"The lower cache is why the requests have to be made frequently.  You have 96MB of L3 on one CCD, and 32MB on the other CCD.  If a thread on the latter needs data cached on the former, it will retrieve it over the IF link, which is slower than a local cached read, but still faster than a DRAM access (which is why the request is made in the first place).  That will then be the newest line of memory, being stored in the L1/L2 of the core that requested it, kicking out the oldest line into the L3, which in turn kicks out the oldest L3 line.  When that latter evicted line is needed again, it will have to be refetched.  It's still likely in the L3 of the first CCD, due to that being triple the size, so it will be requested over the IF link again.    But if both cache sizes are the same, then that scenario will happen much less often.  Both CCD's will end up having mostly the same cache lines stored locally, and only if the data is invalidated (which won't happen to most of the read-only memory involved with running a game) would there need to be a cross-CCD transfer for the same cache line.  There's still room for particular code to not run all that well in that scenario, but it's likely uncommon.  Worst case scenario, you just relegate such a game to a single CCD using *Process Lasso* or some other means of managing process affinity on the fly.  All of this is obvious when you compare the performance of non-X3D 16-core parts to the equivalent 8-core part.  In nearly all games, there's no real difference.

AMD,nkybml3,"Context matters.  The entire M5 SOC won’t need more than 28W sustained for its performance.  Performance wise it’s on par with the 140V and 890M when running at higher TDPs.   There is zero competition in the 28W class but it doesn’t perform better than the Intel/AMD iGPUs if you configure them to pull 70W.  You can configure the TDP up in the Intel and AMD SOCs, if you do so, they’ll perform about equal but then draw around 70W.   About the M5:   Under pure processor load, the processor can briefly consume 30.5 W before stabilizing at 27.5 W. The graphics card draws a maximum of 18-19 W.   About the AMD/intel SOCs:  The Intel chips are usually configured in the 45 W to 115 W range while it can be 30 W to 80 W in the case of AMD. What's important to note is that these CPUs require more than 70 W to achieve these results.   These statements don’t necessarily contradict each other. It’s far ahead of any competition in terms of power classes but with unlimited power the competition can match the performance or even outperform it.   The power class determines the design.  Thin and light notebooks just cannot provide proper cooling for a 70W part, especially not on battery power.  But big heavy notebooks that require constant power connections can still outperform it.  When you limit the competition to 28W which will always be the case in comparable notebooks, the M5 is far ahead.",hardware,2025-10-23 13:22:43,23,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9270009), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 168, 'end': 170}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.821415), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 258, 'end': 263}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6565452), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 264, 'end': 267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8832131), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 346, 'end': 351}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4890542), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 356, 'end': 359}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9648815), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 629, 'end': 634}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7614406), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 735, 'end': 737}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nkxrhh3,"Read more carefully rather than just going for the cheap 'gotcha' - that's likely because the Intel Arc Graphics 140v and AMD Radeon 890M *aren't actually iGPUs design-wise, despite the physical appearance*. The Arc 140v's a logically separate device on a second stacked die in the CPU package. The AMD 890M shares the same die but it's a largely separate device internally connected to the CPU via a PCIe x8 link.

This part is a little funny, though:  >However, Apple trades this performance advantage with increased power consumption. Although the single-core efficiency remains roughly the same as the M4 generation (and still significantly better than the rest of the competition), the increased consumption also leads to slightly shorter battery runtimes.   Problematically, NBC did **not** test energy, which is what they *should* test to correlate the CPU and the battery life. Batteries store energy, not power. That is how race to idle is *theorised* to work: more power for a **short** burst so you can then turn the CPU basically off.  10W \* 5s (50J) consumes less than 5W @ 20s (100J). This is just an example, not real numbers. As another reminder: 1 W = 1 Joule / s. 3600 Joules = 1 Watt-hour. I didn't make the units and I prefer Joules anyways.  Even more problematically, NBC somehow ignores that the [M5 MBP uses a **different** (or at least differently tuned) panel than the M4 MBP](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ocn2l3/comment/nknr7ti/), so battery life measurements may not be purely a CPU / SSD difference, but also a display difference.

AMD,nkyju0k,"The rumored DRAM M5 uses is LPDDR5X-9600, while M4 used LPDDR5X-7500.  For power, the short answer: maybe, maybe not. How much? Likely not a lot more nor a lot less. ***Watts*** would be difficult to believe; LPDDR5X power consumption is measured in milliwatts. 9600 is a [very old (read: mature) bin](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/10l47wi/anandtech_sk_hynix_intros_lpddr5t_memory_low/), tbh.  Why does the age of the bin matter? This needs the longer answer:  1. LPDDR5X-9600, when it first launched [as LPDDR5T by SK Hynix](https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-worlds-fastest-mobile-dram-lpddr5t/) in Jan 2023, was fabbed on the 1α node.

Like CPUs & GPUs, DRAM is binned, but even more so than logic. And especiallly LPDDR5, all bins adhere to JEDEC, thus it's unlike higher-clocked DDR5 desktop DIMMs that can be cheap bins →  XMP/EXPO + pumped voltage + overclocked → guaranteed to be higher power. Desktop users don't need to care, tbh. 3. So higher-clocked LPDDR5 does **not** *need* to consume more power, especially as that bin matures. LPDDR5X-9600 is almost three years old now, which is ancient for a LPDDR bin.  If this was LPDDR5X-10700 that is very new, maybe slightly more power, but LPDDR5X-9600 alone is not the primary reason for M5's higher power consumption.",hardware,2025-10-23 14:05:51,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5078877), 'word': 'DR', 'start': 12, 'end': 14}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7181246), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 28, 'end': 30}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7360986), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 56, 'end': 58}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8958703), 'word': 'SK Hynix', 'start': 529, 'end': 537}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.992409), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 904, 'end': 909}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nlkyzwy,"Hmmm, let's  think.  The Ultra 9 is on a platform that has no future, it's ""dead"", there is no opportunity to drop in the next gen Intel cpu.  The Ultra trails both your current cpu in many games and it trails many of the AMD cpu's.   The Ultra is obliterated by the AMD x3d chips.    The one advantage the Ultra has is in productivity apps.  The 9950x3d goes toe to toe with the Ultra 9 in productivity apps:  a little faster in some, a little slower in others.  The Ultra cannot compare with the 9950x3d in gaming.  The vcache side of 9950x3d is actually a 9800x3d. The 9950x3d also obliterates the Ultra in gaming, because, well it is a 9800x3d when gaming.  Both the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d are on the AM5 platform.  AMD will run its next generation of cpu's, Zen6, on the AM5 platform.  Reliable sources report that Zen7 will also be AM5.  If you go with a chip setting on the AM5 platform (e.g. 9950x3d), you have the opportunity to simply drop in a Zen6 then a Zen7 cpu and have a modern and relevant machine for another 5+ years.  Intel only dreams of this!  The price delta between the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d is about $200.  If you have any doubts, get the 9950x3d.   Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.    I was considering a 9800x3d vs a 9950x3d, I went with the 9950x3d.   Precisely because I want to know I have the flexibility to do more than game.  From a price to performance ratio for gaming, the 9800x3d is the winner.

AMD,nkljcdp,"**Answers:**  **What do you think of the build? Is it solid or has it flaws?**   The CPU + GPU combo is rock solid. I’ve got the same setup and haven’t had a single issue running new titles on ultra settings. My 1080p monitor is the only bottleneck now 😅  **Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK?**   750W should technically be enough, check the GPU vendor specifications just to be safe.  **Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that.**   I’m using the MSI B650 Plus and it works perfectly fine. Unless you need advanced PCIe 5.0 support or beefier VRMs for heavy overclocking, B650(E) should be enough.  **For the 9070XT, I mostly see Sapphire and XFX at lower prices. Are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or ASRock, for example?**   I went with Sapphire—great cooling and no issues so far. If you're not into overclocking, Sapphire or XFX are solid picks. For more aggressive tuning, you might want to compare thermals and VRMs across brands.  **Do I need to buy thermal paste separately?**   I didn’t. My cooler came with pre-applied paste, and I run my CPU at 105W mode. If you’re planning to push beyond that, investing in a good thermal paste could help.  **Do I need a GPU bracket/support/holder?**   Yes—definitely recommended. The 9070XT is a heavy card, and a bracket helps prevent long-term sag or stress on the PCIe slot.  **Do I need anything else that won’t be provided with any of the components yet?**   If you’ve got a modular PSU, make sure you have all the necessary power cables. Also double-check for case screws, standoffs, and Wi-Fi antennas (if your mobo supports it).",pcmasterrace,2025-10-21 13:32:50,2,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9503969), 'word': 'MS', 'start': 557, 'end': 559}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5577263), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 740, 'end': 742}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7793154), 'word': '##pphire', 'start': 742, 'end': 748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67109156), 'word': 'X', 'start': 753, 'end': 754}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.41336167), 'word': 'Giga', 'start': 820, 'end': 824}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.44674876), 'word': 'AS', 'start': 832, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5205169), 'word': 'Sapphire', 'start': 869, 'end': 877}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45685434), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 947, 'end': 949}]",Tópico 5

AMD,nlumf3x,"There were SKUs that had a third and even a fourth digit in previous generations like the 5825U (mind you that is a Barcelo part, which was basically a small refresh of Cezanne). But AMD really popularized it and introduced it with the 7000 series to provide ""clarity"" as to what architecture something is. Why did they do that? Because in that same 5000 series lineup they had a mix of Zen2 and Zen3 parts. Like the 5300U which was Lucienne architecture, which was Zen2, but the 5800U was Zen3 Cezanne.  But it's just stupid because with the 6000 series, everything was Zen 3+, so whether you bought a 6800U or a 6600U it was all Zen3+. It didn't matter what you picked and tbh that's how they should have carried on, only make the new stuff the new generation naming.  In the 7000 series though they went back to the 5000 series naming sort of because they decided to mix old architectures again with the new stuff. For example, the 7735HS a Zen 3 chip and the 7745HX a Zen4 chip, that one third digit is supposed to notify you that you're buy Zen4, therefore it was as an indicator as to what Ryzen generation you were buying, but it just confused consumers even more because some people thought a 7640HS was worse than a 7735HS, but in single core the 7640HS beat the 7735HS and in multi-thread both were about even.

AMD,nlts0kp,"The problem's that the moment these come onto the market isn't the moment every single older laptop gets wiped off the market, especially considering these are practically the same chips being re-released time and time again by AMD. Here's an example:  One customer looks at 5 budget laptops and their processors. #1 has a Ryzen 5 7520U, #2 has a Ryzen 3 7440U, #3 has a Ryzen 5 220, #4 has an older, discounted Ryzen 5 5600U, #5 has a Ryzen 5 40. Place your bets on the best one now.  Where do you even begin to compare these? Well, the Ryzen 5 7520U has a higher number than the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 5600U, so it should be better, right? Wrong. Both the 7520U and 7440U are 4-cores, 8-threads, but the Ryzen 5 7520U has a 15W TDP, 4MB of L3 cache, is Zen 2-based (from 2019), and has a Radeon 610M iGPU. Meanwhile, the 7440U has a 28W TDP, 8MB of L3 cache, is Zen 4-based (3 years newer), and has a Radeon 740M iGPU. It's going to be an order of magnitude faster than the chip that's a higher number than it. As for the Ryzen 5 5600U? It's a 6-core, 12-thread Zen 3 chip with a 15W TDP, 16MB of L3 cache, with a much inferior Vega 7 iGPU.  Okay... so the Ryzen 7520U is a no-go, and the Ryzen 7440U and Ryzen 5600U are kind of up for debate if you have a dGPU in these laptops (though absolutely pick the 7440U if the iGPU is the only form of graphics onboard). Well what's up with the Ryzen 5 40? What generation does that fall under? If the third digit of the 7000 series was architecture, and the first digit of the 5000 series was architecture, is the Ryzen 5 40... Zen 4 based? Well no, you're not supposed to know that, you're supposed to just believe it's a new chip. Well we know it's a Zen 2 4-core 8-thread with 4MB of L3 cache from the article, but this potential customer doesn't. They'll find it out if they research it, but by this point they're probably getting sick of researching CPUs when the vast majority of people know barely anything more than an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 being good, and an RTX graphics also being good. They most likely don't know anything about cores, architectures, TDP, or L3 cache, and probably just want a working laptop.  What about the, uh, Ryzen 5 220? That seems... probably a fair bit worse than the Ryzen 3 7440U and Ryzen 5 5600U going off the name and potentially being connected in naming scheme to the Ryzen 5 40, so it's worse, right? Nope. The Ryzen 5 220 is a 6-core, 12-thread, Zen 4-based, 28W chip with 16MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 740M graphics. A clear choice to pick that gets the best of both worlds with regards to the cores & cache of the older chip, and the newer architecture and iGPU of the newer chip.  Outside of this hypothetical scenario now, I want to add an honourable mention to compare to the Ryzen 5 220. I'd like to bring up the Ryzen AI 5 330, which is a Zen 5-based 4-core 8-thread 28W chip with 8MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 820M graphics. It's got less cores and less L3 cache than the Ryzen 5 220 and most likely will be worse in benchmarks [(and as a matter of fact, it is)](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6616vs6917/AMD-Ryzen-5-220-vs-AMD-Ryzen-AI-5-330), but despite this is a tier above (X20 v. X30) the 220, and very few will catch that the newer chip is worse than the older one. Even chips within this new naming scheme are inconsistent.  When these chips come out, the laptop market isn't going to have done away with the older chips for no good reason. [These chips are still out there](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Notebook-Keyboard-Professional/dp/B0FT3CR5VK), and customers looking for an AMD chip are gonna regret looking for one if they have to compare this kind of shit. This naming scheme's only a year old with the Ryzen AI 300 series, and the previous one (where the architecture was defined by the third digit) lasted two generations from 2023 to 2024. Pre-2023 laptops are perfectly usable for the average person and they're still going to be selling those laptops today, and god help anyone looking for an AMD laptop that has to deal with this naming BS. Intel's not much better with their 200V series but at least it looks like they're going to stay the course and keep using that naming scheme now that desktop and mobile are somewhat unified. AMD's just drunkenly driving off a cliff with their mobile naming scheme and landing on another cliff they'll drive off on in a year or two. Meanwhile, their desktop chips are very easy to understand in comparison. No random digit amount switching, no sneaky third digit signifying architectures, or any of that nonsense. The Ryzen 5 9600 is faster than the Ryzen 5 7600.

An Intel i7-870 is much worse than an Intel i3-12100.  Going past the obvious, a Ryzen 9 9900X is worse for gaming than a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and Ryzen 7 5700 is worse than a Ryzen 5 5600 (because the 5700 is a special chip - whereas usually chips like the 5600 are based off lower-clocked 5600Xs under the same architecture, the 5700 is based off the 5700G with PCIe 3.0 and much lower L3 cache.

You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.  So yea, 2x32GB in PC world can sometimes mean it's still 32GB :)",AMD,2025-10-24 08:29:58,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9078869), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 201, 'end': 203}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95473045), 'word': 'PCI Express', 'start': 788, 'end': 799}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9132234), 'word': 'PCI', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88396037), 'word': 'Express', 'start': 1299, 'end': 1306}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6217477), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1384, 'end': 1385}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8081856), 'word': 'H', 'start': 1391, 'end': 1392}]",Tópico 1

AMD has to cloak them lower for power management and thermal management.  And while Dense has less CCDs, they still have more Cores and cache to power and thermally manage one 1 package. If they were clocked, like consumer CCDs, they would use beyond 1000 watts of power, and thats 1000 watts of heat that needs to be handled for 1 CPU. And 1 enterprise chasis can have 4 of these chips in it. Thats 4000 watts of power and heat to manage in 1 chasis, just for the CPUs.  Put 52 of these in a 1 rack, 200 Kilowatts for 1 rack, just to power and manage heat of the CPUs  And thats not even including the GPUs that might be used in the same systems, with AI being as popular as it is right now.  But, stick 2 of those CCDs on a consumer CPU for 32 cores, you could clock them higher and it would use at most, 200 watts.  > Next generation Ryzen consumer CPU's CCD's will be on N2 nodes, not N3.

As of this year, I believe AMD has surpassed a very crucial threshold that will leave Intel in the dust and become the next truly big player. The patents they have for chips coming down the line check out from a logical and practical standpoint that they will easily deliver more performance than what AMD has even advertised and expand on physical architecture. While if you compare what Intel has put out patent-wise wise it looks like a kindergartener took a whack at it. Literally 0 physical innovations and 100% software ""upgrades"".

AMD,nlijpij,"As much as I'd really love for this to be an international release of an amazing budget gaming CPU, I doubt it'll be as rosy as it seems at first glance.  Historically, the 5600X3D released as a Microcenter US-exclusive (if you can even call it that) release, as did the 7600X3D. The 5500X3D was rumoured to exist back in 2024 but only released in the past few months as a Latin America exclusive. Only the 5700X3D came to international fruition, and it's a few tiers above this chip, so I wouldn't consider it all that equivalent (against say, the 5500X3D). As for the non-X3D 7500(F) for the majority of its life it was an exclusive release as well and Westerners could only get them via Aliexpress, eBay or any other unofficial third party resellers. That's changed recently, it seems the 7500F is now mostly available globally, but in a fair amount of countries it's still more expensive than the 7600, and it's taken 3 years since the launch of Zen 4 to get here.  AMD's kept AM5 at a relatively high price point compared to budget AM4 and I'd reckon it intentional. Why would they suddenly release a budget X3D CPU to bring down the price of AM5 to consumers when Intel's effectively meaningless in the gaming segment already?  Aside from that, AMD historically doesn't seem to want to release budget X3D CPUs internationally, and you can't really blame them. It'd take away 7800X3D and 9800X3D customers if they see a budget X3D chip doing 90% of the performance for half the cost. That could be different in places like Latin America though, where there could be a price gap AMD could fill with a budget X3D CPU.

AMD,nlvbssh,"It's why they wait to release the lower end X3D SKUs (if at all) after the more expensive/premium ones have had a decent enough lifespan. That, or yields ran out & they just had to begin selling whatever defective dies they had sitting around lol. Either way, I get it from a business standpoint. The 5600X3D (albeit a MC exclusive that wasn't available for long) was still an admittedly ""better"" CPU overall compared to the 5700X3D in every game where its frequency advantage was a more significant dependency than having 2 additional cores/threads. Don't get me wrong, it's great that we even got either of those 2 in the first place after the ground-breaking debut of the just the 5800X3D (at a much higher price that never really dropped all that much over the years). But they are ultimately lesser binned versions of that aforementioned SKU. However, the performance parity between them & their superior counterpart(s) is not always such a significant gap -- perhaps only single digit % differences in overall fps in some titles. Although more often than not, we at least see the SKUs with a higher overall boost clock as being a lot closer than not.

I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 2

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove?

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

AMD,n212egt,"Edit: solved. Windows is capable of disabling e-cores on boot. The setting to turn them back on in MSCONFIG, boot tab, cores dropdown. Whatever feature causes this, I do not know but would love to find out, and furthermore their is no legitimate purpose for this feature, and Intel should prevent Microsoft from doing this, in my opinion, if there is any legal means available. Unless it interferes with Intel’s revenue.  Poor performance, incredibly low benchmarks. Beginning to suspect bad CPU.  I have tried bone stock with cleared CMOS settings. I have loaded multiple overclocking profiles, clearing CMOS in between. I have tried undervolting, and adjusting Load Line. I have changed Lite Load settings. I have tried with and without XMP enabled. Changed windows power plans. Nothing gets my cinebench r23 score above 11k. CPU-Z benchmarks it as 43% as fast as the previous generation CPU.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone?

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

AMD,navj4sy,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Intel,2025-08-27 01:58:06,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9981675), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 60, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5757755), 'word': 'X', 'start': 142, 'end': 143}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9160963), 'word': 'X', 'start': 181, 'end': 182}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7241087), 'word': 'VROC', 'start': 213, 'end': 217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975128), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 316, 'end': 321}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9981376), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 362, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.71470153), 'word': 'X', 'start': 446, 'end': 447}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5083882), 'word': 'AS', 'start': 537, 'end': 539}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6538813), 'word': 'MS', 'start': 543, 'end': 545}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.75366527), 'word': 'G', 'start': 548, 'end': 549}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.848027), 'word': 'VROC', 'start': 631, 'end': 635}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7676257), 'word': 'X', 'start': 668, 'end': 669}]",Tópico 5
