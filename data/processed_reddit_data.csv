Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Like, the volume for both ""launches"" is supposed to be low, actual devices probably won't be available to purchase until the next year, but. Companies are supposed to be receiving samples of Panther Lake. Now. Presently.   For them to say their roadmap isn't affected, isn't changed at all. Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than.

No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

Intel,nes030p,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power.

It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years. Seems like not a good compromise when you're eating more power per unit of performance.   That is, the A19 Pro on fp has skewed towards the flatter part of the perf / W curve.   >And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.48614332, 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88643, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.604474, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.95716006, 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.420649, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4713005, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 2

AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores.

I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.

With DLSSQ and FrameGen I'm at 140FPS or more. All in WQHD. Framegen also reduces (yes, you read that right) Latency by a big chunk because Reflex is activated with it. An option to disable Framegen and activate Reflex would be cool, tho. I modded it in with SpecialK, but not offering an Option in the settings is a huge miss from the Devs. That game has huge Latency Spikes (up to 100MS) and you can feel it drastically. So Reflex is a must even without FrameGen.  I settled to use FrameGen with a Reshade called Lillium HDR Reshade witch offers a Reshade to Sharpen the Game, so I don't have many troubles with ghosting from Framegen. I also installed a Mod Manager named UltraModManager that greatly buffs visuals and offers a fix for black floors (Color grading is a little bit off in games from those Devs). Right now I play with Game with 120FPS+ with DLSS Q and Framegen enabled but without much noticeable Ghosting and with decent Latency and HW Lumen enabled. If you like to Fiddle with UE and don't hesitate to install Mods, it's a great Game. The ""Basic"" experience is meh, tho. Not because of the lack of FPS, but because of that huge Latency thing.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services.

Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.

I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,68,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.98579425, 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6807291, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.53338933, 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8288868, 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8976541, 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87239146, 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87449735, 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.52110374, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.63087755, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9507805, 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5053189, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8337852, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69437224, 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5678201, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6214103, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6280626, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 1

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default. To fix that you just needed re-set GPU OC and resave preset after update.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:43:03,-1,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9695132, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 156, 'end': 159}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88498735, 'word': 'Adrenaline', 'start': 164, 'end': 174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91052073, 'word': 'Adrenalin', 'start': 236, 'end': 245}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5489837, 'word': 'Adrena', 'start': 411, 'end': 417}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87020636, 'word': 'Adrenalin', 'start': 556, 'end': 565}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8562875, 'word': 'Adrenalin', 'start': 676, 'end': 685}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.59713656, 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 734, 'end': 736}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.54239225, 'word': '##lin', 'start': 740, 'end': 743}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.81773597, 'word': 'Adrenalin', 'start': 831, 'end': 840}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.544349, 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 895, 'end': 897}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8044027, 'word': 'O', 'start': 939, 'end': 940}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.82464623, 'word': 'O', 'start': 988, 'end': 989}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96178347, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1025}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6096232, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1055, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7416693, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1059, 'end': 1060}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.54346573, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1141, 'end': 1143}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.86419505, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1145, 'end': 1146}]",Tópico 1

Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.949649, 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91378605, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7303601, 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975333, 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84053415, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6853485, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 5

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9945433, 'word': 'Nintendo', 'start': 23, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7072387, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 104, 'end': 108}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.736587, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 145, 'end': 149}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9411086, 'word': 'N', 'start': 262, 'end': 263}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99181014, 'word': 'C', 'start': 334, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7018669, 'word': '##UDA', 'start': 335, 'end': 338}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9394868, 'word': 'C', 'start': 595, 'end': 596}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.59285474, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 597, 'end': 599}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69475675, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 996, 'end': 999}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.93300354, 'word': 'PyTorch', 'start': 1181, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8076242, 'word': 'AL', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1397}]",Tópico 1

Intel,jwv1po6,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.

Intel,niy0ck1,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

I don't even think intel can fix it or has any interest in fixing it as they knew about it since december of last year and nothing has come out to try fix it. How big a problem is really dependant on what games you wanna play. It can only be like a 5% overhead issue which still puts it faster than the 4060 and 7600 but theres some games where it's like 20% or more where you have to have a very strong cpu to not see the overhead.  Do some research on the games you play and that will tell u whether to buy a b580 or a 9060 xt.

AMD,nj50tjd,It will probably be the biggest upgrade since OG zen but I also expect it to be the biggest price hike for the same reason.  They are going from 5/4nm to 2nm so it's two node jumps (Skipping 3nm). They are rumored to be significantly upgrading the IO die and going from 8 to 12 cores and significantly increasing frequency and IPC.   Even auxiliary downsides we have been dealing with since the original move to chiplets (Really high idle power) are rumored to be fixed.   Don't expect it to be cheap though.

AMD,niojc56,"Not really. They really only did it once (40 series), while the others were minor tweaks.  * 20 Series had a solid Lvl 3 implementation from the start. * 30 series allowed concurrent RT+Compute + implemented HW RT motion blur (for 3DFX and proviz not gaming) + 33% larger L1 * 40 series, OMM, SER and DMM (deprecated) and supersized L2  * 50 series, LSS + RTX MG HW decompression  2X ray/tri matters very little compared to the rest.

They have OBB+Dynamic VGPR (now Intel has that too with Xe3) and instance node transformations in HW (NVIDIA hasn't specified this yet).   DXR 1.2 forces them to support OMM and SER in HW. AMD will also have BVH traversal in HW as well (Radiance Cores). All they need now is LSS, but they investigated that years before 50 series launched in a filed patent and it's the next logical step so they'll prob have it.

Then there's ton of additional stuff well beyond 50 series in patents but impossible to say what will actually get implemented but it can push the implementation WELL beyond 50 series.

This could be things like compression for overlay trees, delta instances, DMMs and DGF and probably many things that're still not public.  Also Hunyh specifically talking about reduced CPU overhead from Radiance Engines. That can only mean one ting: Fully GPU driven BVH construction.

It also minimizes memory access latencies, thereby increasing overall ray tracing system efficiencies.""*  *""It also minimizes memory traffic, since all requisite data can be stored in an internal memory of the sorting circuitry, instead of multiple DMA requests between register files and sorting circuitry.""*  This should result in large speedups.

AMD deal: openAI buys full price but gets AMD stock as rebate.  The deal is almost like an employee compensation plan.  Every GPU purchased earns openai a stock award.  The Nvidia deal works for openai because it's valuation rich but cash poor and works for Nvidia because it has a large margin on its chips and get to invest in a way that juices its own sales.  The AMD deal works for AMD because their stock price is relatively low and they need to jump start purchases of their ai hardware.  It works for openai because they get a rebate effectively and a Nvidia alternative to diversify supply risk.

Basically, for every $1 of GPU purchase by OpenAI, Nvidia buys $0.6 of stock from OpenAI, so in essence Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for 60% of its purchase in stock and the rest in cash.  Recall that Nvidia's gross margin on their GPUs are about 70% and even their net profit margin is about 55%  So even on a cash basis Nvidia is still revenue positive on the GPUs it will sell to open ai, while it gets rewarded handsomely in openAI stock.  If the deals DO reach the announced $100B value, it will have meant that openAi would have found enough revenue to meet its most optimistic projections, in which case NVIDIA's stock purchase would be worth a fortune.

TSMC is actually carrying significant counterparty risk in these deals because both the Nvidia and the AMD deals translate to larger planned buys that may not materialize.  It's TSMC that has to build the physical factories to make all the chips, and they have to do so ahead of projected demand.  That mean they have to treat these large projected buy numbers as ""real"" or risk failing their customers.  On the other hand they know that the upper range of these numbers have got to be BS, but where to place their bets?  TSMC is probably actually happy for Intel foundry and Samsung to soak up some of the projected demand so they are not alone in carrying the risk of over building manufacturing capacity.",hardware,2025-10-06 20:30:01,13,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9936094, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 0, 'end': 6}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84632605, 'word': 'OpenAI', 'start': 38, 'end': 44}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9840593, 'word': 'OpenAI', 'start': 155, 'end': 161}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99436754, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 163, 'end': 169}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9652057, 'word': 'OpenAI', 'start': 194, 'end': 200}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98167664, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 216, 'end': 222}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99604654, 'word': 'Open AI', 'start': 230, 'end': 237}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99097586, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 313, 'end': 319}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9792595, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 434, 'end': 440}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84020376, 'word': 'open', 'start': 541, 'end': 545}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7981318, 'word': 'openA', 'start': 629, 'end': 634}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.89879745, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 723, 'end': 729}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9621372, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 933, 'end': 939}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98754996, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 944, 'end': 948}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9873171, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 951, 'end': 955}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8648897, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1039, 'end': 1045}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9315059, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1054, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9461744, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 1129, 'end': 1133}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.73927736, 'word': 'BS', 'start': 1437, 'end': 1439}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9957811, 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 1473, 'end': 1477}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9985026, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1509, 'end': 1514}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99856573, 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 1527, 'end': 1534}]",Tópico 3

AMD,ni68e2m,"Nvidia will be fine even if things continue as is. Their fundamentals are fine for the most part, they have a valuable proprietary technology moat, aren't particularly overleveredged, are low in debt, etc. its terrible for many nvidia investors who may be depending on nvidia's stock price unrealistic current evaluation bc the stock will collapse, but a stock price catering is on its own not enough to kill a company. A stock price crash can kill a company if the company needs the investor money to invest in something to scale up production to profitable levels (nvidia is already mostly at scale so this isn't a problem), if the company is already going through a massive debt crisis/restructuring, or whatever other scenario that their revenue can't cover short term cash flow. Of course this can still wipe out irresponsible investors, but that's a different story. Hell even in the extreme unrealistic case where ai 100% dies, I think nvidia has a good chance of surviving, and even outside that, their IP and market presence is large enough that in the worst case they will be bought out, and even if that somehow fails, they're likely to be bailed out to retain any sensitive IP. If Chrysler can survive 2008, nvidia can survive the ai bubble popping  And investing in a company to buy your product isn't as dumb as it sounds at first (though I think the scale involved is a bit ridiculous.) Nvidia isnt just investing in openai to buy their products directly, they're investing in openai to scale up open ai into being a mature, reliable, and dependent Nvidia customer. This is actually pretty common among ang large industry. This is exactly how aws managed to become big so fast, they invested in random companies that weren't profitable so that they could scale up and become profitable companies that were dependent on aws, EVs do this with battery companies and vice versa, this is how most early industrial companies like JP Morgan grew, this is how telecom grew, dot com, etc. Now it pretty much guarantees a bubble, or rather it only makes sense in a bubble, since the goal is to have the people you invested in mature fast enough to survive the bubble popping and then remain dependent on you.

Dumping that many shares will guarantee a hit to the future stock price, or if they are transferred in full to a third party via sale/acquisition of OpenAI then that's yet another potential risk for AMD. Before this deal the largest shareholder was only around 3-4%, so if someone wanted to make a future play on a hostile takeover buying that 10% stake from OpenAI after the company implodes would be the first order of business.

AMD,nif6vz6,"I should have stated more precisely that the AMD leadership believed stock is low relative to competitor valuations in the market and the valuation that could be achieved with more AI sales.  This was factually correct on both counts: 1) compare amd pe to Nvidia 2) see AMD stock performance day of the announcement  Being relatively low or high versus comparable companies in the current market or versus anticipated pricing in some future scenario is well defined and relatively simple in concept, free of hidden assumptions.  Being ""fair"" is not in the sense that you were putting forth where a company's stock could be deemed fairly valued based on fundamentals compared to some absolute standard or some historical average or market average.  Now you have dragged in a huge number of hidden assumptions and subjective taste, and wedded yourself by taste to a philosophy of valuation that fits poorly with the market's actual dynamical behavior.  All of this leads to confusing analysis that tends to bury rather than surface actionable insights.  Investing based on ""fundamentals"" is actually hugely complicated.  You use a simple seeming set of analyses but all of the above complexity is shoved into candidate sector selection, company selection and trade execution behaviors based on inference centered human neural network training (ie taste and intuition) combined with complex logic.    Only very few people can do that in a way that beats the market consistently after a lifetime of experience.

Percentage based performance charts for upscalers is unfortunately a very bad way of understanding what kind of performance uplift to expect.

I could explain it here, but I suck at writing out stuff like this in a way that makes sense.

Read this thread for a full understanding, but for a short breakdown, this bit is the most important part:  > Imagine I have Game A, B and C which can render natively at 720p at 30, 60 and 120FPS respectively and upscaling to 1440p with FSR3 and FSR4. For FSR3 on the 6600 the 1440p upscale cost is usually ~1.2ms, while for FSR4 it's ~4.3ms. This is how switching from FSR3 to FSR4 would impact the performance profile in each game:  > Game A (30FPS = ~33ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~33ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 34.2ms = 29.2FPS  >     FSR4: ~33ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 37.3ms = 26.8FPS  > Game B (60FPS = ~16ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~16ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 17.2ms = 58.1FPS  >     FSR4: ~16ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 20.3ms = 49.3FPS  > Game C (120FPS = ~8ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~8ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 9.2ms = 108FPS  >     FSR4: ~8ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 12.3ms = 81.3FPS  > On game A FSR4 gets 91.7% the performance of FSR3, on game B it gets 84% the performance of FSR3 and on game C it gets 75% the performance of FSR3.  This should explain that as your input framerate gets lower, the output framerate will be closer between FSR3 and FSR4.

AMD,nh2esb4,"I was always surprised the media didn't spend more time discussing some of the crazy launch era voltage defaults all the vendors were using. Granted with Gigabyte frying chips and ASUS frying chips plus their own motherboards honorably committing seppuku for the chipacide afterwards, there was a lot going on.  I built a system a month after AM5 launched with a 7700X and ASRock B650E Riptide Wifi motherboard. Out of the gate VSOC defaulted to 1.25v but was reported at 1.288v by ZenTimings 1.29. VDD Misc was 1.3v, and CLDO was 1.10. Currently VDD Misc defaults to 1.1v, CLDO defaults to 0.95v even when setting 6000 1:1, and now VSOC shows as red if set above even 1.23v. VSOC also now actually delivers the voltage it's set to without running above it, so either ZenTimings changed how it measures or ASRock changed its LLC setting for the VSOC rail.  Will have to finish the video later but I do wonder if Steve is factoring in the ever-mercurial voltage defaults all the vendors were using. I know ASRock personally changed and tweaked every single voltage knob & paired LLC knob that existed and was constantly changing them for the first year, and still tweaking them by year two to try and lock down the memory headaches users were having. But some of those default voltages were still nuts even when the X3D chips first launched. So if users did update UEFI versions religiously I could easily see any initial damage caused before the UEFI was updated weakening the chip, thereby triggering a belated failure later despite now running on safer voltages.",hardware,2025-09-30 20:05:58,53,Neutral,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5010798, 'word': 'AS', 'start': 180, 'end': 182}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5389448, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 343, 'end': 345}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8198412, 'word': 'AS', 'start': 373, 'end': 375}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.85367846, 'word': 'VSOC', 'start': 428, 'end': 432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97535175, 'word': 'CLDO', 'start': 522, 'end': 526}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5946823, 'word': 'V', 'start': 547, 'end': 548}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.72551465, 'word': 'Mi', 'start': 551, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.94774437, 'word': 'CLDO', 'start': 574, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96405405, 'word': 'VSOC', 'start': 633, 'end': 637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9661112, 'word': 'VSOC', 'start': 676, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8105078, 'word': 'ZenTimings', 'start': 768, 'end': 778}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.973089, 'word': 'AS', 'start': 806, 'end': 808}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.57683975, 'word': '##ock', 'start': 809, 'end': 812}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5459936, 'word': 'VSO', 'start': 845, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.99456704, 'word': 'Steve', 'start': 912, 'end': 917}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9339488, 'word': 'ASRock', 'start': 1005, 'end': 1011}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.82462204, 'word': 'U', 'start': 1364, 'end': 1365}]",Tópico 3

AMD,nh9aaga,"From someone smarter then me:   NVIDIA DMM and AMD DGF are fundamentally different approaches to the same problem. DMM works by taking the original surface and then radically reducing its detail, so in the end it consists of fewer triangles, while storing the surface information in the form of a displacement map. This way, the BVH acceleration structure can remain simple, since only a fraction of the surface's real detail needs to be taken into account for the actual calculations. DGF, on the other hand, is a scalable, lossy compression method for meshlets, and unlike DMM, it actually represents the geometry instead of only reproducing it through a displacement map. The result is similar, and the BVH acceleration structure can remain relatively simple. Since both methods are lossy compression techniques, there will be some quality degradation, but the benefits gained from compression are significantly greater than the loss in quality.  The principle is therefore similar, but the advantages and disadvantages lie in different places. DMM compresses much more effectively, so in theory the gain is greater, but because of the required surface preprocessing it imposes a significant overhead on the CPU, and it is also not compatible with the actual geometry used in today's games, since the content has to be tailored specifically for DMM. DGF compresses less effectively, so in theory the gain is smaller, but it is compatible with all kinds of geometry, and it does not impose any significant overhead on the CPU either.  Because DMM proved so impractical that no developer was willing to adopt it, NVIDIA decided to discontinue the technology in the RTX 50 series, meaning it is unlikely to ever see use in practice.  Since DMM is practically unusable, NVIDIA introduced Mega Geometry as its replacement, which primarily works by clustering triangles rather than manipulating the surface itself. This addresses DMM's compatibility issues and imposes relatively low additional overhead on the CPU, but it does not perform actual geometric compression, meaning its memory requirements are extremely high compared to both DMM and DGF.  A simple comparison of the situation:  DMM: very limited surface compatibility, high CPU overhead, extremely low memory usage  Mega Geometry: full surface compatibility, moderate CPU overhead, very high memory usage  DGF: full surface compatibility, low CPU overhead, low memory usage",hardware,2025-10-01 21:20:13,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.94033456, 'word': 'N', 'start': 32, 'end': 33}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.6635889, 'word': '##VI', 'start': 33, 'end': 35}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.78861374, 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 35, 'end': 38}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8058861, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 47, 'end': 49}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7525729, 'word': 'D', 'start': 115, 'end': 116}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6522938, 'word': 'B', 'start': 329, 'end': 330}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.40158758, 'word': 'D', 'start': 486, 'end': 487}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5320012, 'word': 'D', 'start': 575, 'end': 576}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7895912, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1048, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.34360102, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1348, 'end': 1349}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7894819, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1353, 'end': 1354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5286972, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1545, 'end': 1546}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9073203, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1614, 'end': 1620}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9923113, 'word': 'R', 'start': 1666, 'end': 1667}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.69102144, 'word': '##X', 'start': 1668, 'end': 1669}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.58771676, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1740, 'end': 1741}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9336649, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1769, 'end': 1775}]",Tópico 4

AMD,ngoqy41,"As I understand it DGF is a technique for compressing geometry to reduce memory usage and at least in the first paper, reduces performance when tracing. The memory reduction is like a factor of 6x but tracing can be slowed by like 2x. This site is showing that you can slot animation into DGF cheaply (i.e. change the vertex positions and rebuild the blocks). In reality the cost of animating geometry with RT had little to do with the cost of transforming the vertices, GPUs are very good at that.  Touching any part of geometry means you need to rebuild the BVH or you'll be missing movement in the ray traced representation. DGF doesn't address this (its implementation isn't strictly connected to BVHs, although the meshlet blocks can be used as leaves in the structure). So it is expected that BVHs and ray tracing would remain the expensive part since the same stuff happens with or without DGF. Like you stated, the cost of this process is why it's not usually implemented in RT games - the less geometry you change, the more you can delay rebuilding or do partial updates instead.

AMD,ngphnue,"Absolutely. DGF with HW acceleration could be great if it could make decompression free, then they could reap memory benefits (if it was adopted, it requires baking to use). RTX Mega Geometry existing kills off any excitement for DGF for me, DGF seems like AMDs answer to DMMs which were lower quality but 3x better at compressing and faster to decompress. Meanwhile DMM acceleration has been killed off from 50 series in favor of Mega Geometry which handles every case DGF wants to: granular BVH, clusters, partial rebuilds, memory reduction. Which also works on earlier series...  Nanite seems to have proven to everyone clusters are the next step in LOD management. Intel Micro mesh, NVIDIA CLAS. I was unaware of PTLAS (thank you for inspiring a deep dive!) but you are right, Intel and NVIDIA again. Shocking AMD do not have any response to either feature (yet??). I guess Project Redstone is probably their focus right now? They absolutely need a response to Mega Geometry!  Edit: I suppose if they can get HW accel building to be fast enough, DGF leaf node BVH could achieve some of the same benefits since its effectively a cluster BVH (which AMD tested by using primitives, maybe their next target to implement in hardware?).

AMD,ngqaubu,"Very interesting, AMD are taking advantage of DGF for rapid and wide culling to speed up intersection testing. This could indeed be their way of hardware accelerating cluster intersections, although I'm intrigued what the practical uplift this gives nor how they address building new clusters. I have no idea what NVIDIA did to achieve the same on prior gens.  I also had no idea NV MG BLAS info was posted. It's conceptually simple but it's a very smart intuition that since RT with a good accelerator is less tri constrained, you can just reuse high poly BLAS and forego swapping LODs. I'm guessing Ray Reconstruction is very useful here to cut back on any extreme aliasing. Very curious now to see how they managed to optimize animated geometry, maybe heavy partitioning with lazy BLAS refit or just brute force rebuilds. Regardless NVIDIA is obviously far ahead with a more united stack of solutions.  Despite AMDs talent I find it more impressive that Intel manage to keep up with graphics developments much quickly. XeSS, ExtraSS, cluster and partition acceleration structures, etc. Their media encoders have also remained competitive.

AMD,ngsk7bl,"Number one   Yeah so it seems at based on the AMD patents, but it's not just DGF patents, they also have a fallback method called prefiltering nodes, which is probably very similar to how the RTX Mega geometry clusters work on 50 series, but I could be wrong and like you said NVIDIA doesn't exactly spill the beans on architectural intricacies. While DGF is superior (compression and memory accesses characteristics) this fallback is also made for rapid and wide culling like you said.  Apparently the idea is to precompute a set of quantized BVH data matching the full precision data. It can even be leveraged for ray/box intersections but it seems like triangles will benefit the most.   From what I can read INT operations are multiple times more ressource efficient than FP. That is all PPA characteristics, power, performance at area. From what I can read online it's anywhere from 3-5X, might be wrong, but the patents directly mention ""multiple times more"" so it's at least 3x. In effect AMD can probably shrink the current FP pipeline down, given it'll only be used for inconclusive final tests, and at little cost to die area implement a very wide parallel intersection tester unit that eats ray/tri intersection tests for breakfast.      Another benefit of DGF is that you can include pretty much all the relevant data within one node, so you do just one memory access for the entire block and you can begin doing RT. For example opacity micro maps data has a header within the DGF block. Still no info on subdivisions + tesselations but that's no doubt coming as well given MG supports it, or it'll be included in an accompanying template similar to MG. They also talk about rays coalesced against the same node in the patents, where you mass test rays at once before removing the DGF data, but IDK if that's how things are done today already.  Github FTW! Yeah me to as usual NVIDIA holding their cards close :/ I'm pretty sure the animations rely heavily on subdivisions and tesselation based on this: [https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk\_animated\_clusters](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_animated_clusters) This simplifies the underlying geometry and should massively speed up rebuilds and avoid them entirely.  For sure, NVIDIA as always ahead of the competition and look at the joke of MS's DXR 1.2. Embracing NVIDIA's functionality over 2 years later and it's still not shipping till Q1 2026, while SER and OMM has been supported since Q4 2022 xD on NVIDIA side.  Intel has long played a leading role in graphics and ray tracing for a long time, before NVIDIA even introduced RTX + has invested a lot in research and is behind a lot of open source SW used in rendering applications. In addition, like NVIDIA, Intel went all AI and HW accell, for example they planned to have SER one year before NVIDIA, but Alchemist got delayed.   Meanwhile AMD used the bean counter approach of wait and see and relying on shaders, they still rely on that for BVH processing. Meanwhile NVIDIA and Intel took the full RT core approach right from the start. Look at where that got them. 5 years of ignoring ML super res only to go all in last minute with FSR 4 + no DLL swap until very recently (FSR 3.1) despite NVIDIA having that for over 5 years. I mean who TF runs that SW department, this is incredibly stupid.

AMD,ngsk7ne,"Number 2  RDNA 4 is really just a stopgap nothing more, similar to RDNA 1. They also had Vega iGPU for many gens until RDNA 2 came along, RDNA 3.5 looks to be another repeat of that. RDNA 5/UDNA is poised to be another RDNA 2 full stack moment except this time probably a lot better and less complacent on the SW side.  Me too but based on all the changes suggested in patents (we'll see how many actually ends up in products) + rumours of a clean slate overhaul not seen since GCN in 2011 the picture is slowly taking form and best case assuming NVIDIA keeps rebranding Ampere cores (they really haven't done foundational changes since then) gen the nextgen from AMD could be the most competitive since the Terascale based HD series.  Not gonna spill the beans on the patents today, it's too early but right before launch, then perhaps I might eventually do another post similar to the one I did in the Spring that was picked up by tech media. All you need to know is that AMD id seemingly doing a fundamental overhaul of pretty much every aspect of a GPU, with a particularly strong focus on cachemem system efficiency and data locality.  But I can tell about the major scheduling changes in some of the patents, but it's really just the tip of the iceberg alongside the DGF + prefilter stuff.   Scheduling will go from top down orchestrated to localized hierarchical scheduling and dispatch down to the CU unit. Scheduling will be offloaded to Shader Engines with the command processor job being only to prepare work items and do load balancing between Shader Engines through ""work stealing"" indicated on idle or overloaded signals from the individual Shaders Engines. As a new thing scheduling and dispatch can be decoupled from the SPI completely at the CU level allowing each WorkGroup processor to dispatch its own work queue with unprecedented granularity and latency. The patent mentions an order of magnitude improvement in thread launch performance.  I have a post in here on that from \~8 weeks ago in case you're interested that goes more into depth. All this is to deliver better core scaling and prob drive increased performance for branchy code and GPU Work Graphs API workloads.

There's also the IBM method from a decade ago where they give every core a large L2 cache, and a portion of the L2 cache can be tagged by another core to be used as a virtual L3 cache. Or a CPU die can use another CPU die's L2 caches as a virtual L4 cache (as long as the CPU dies are on the same package to avoid communicating over the motherboard). In theory, a single core in an entire CPU package could address about 8GB cache with the virtual L3 and L4 setup.

With a 4-way set associative cache, the lower bits of the memory address are used to select a single set within the cache, which stores four cache lines. The data is guaranteed to be in one of those four memory locations (or not at all).   Which makes lookups very fast, you look at the memory address to find which set it should be in, and fetch that set's tags from the tag array. All four tags can be checked in parallel with special hardware, and then it knows exactly where in cache the data will be found.   -----  The cache needs to be small because of physics.

AMD,nhppy5n,I do have to be fair. It's not like a lot of that fault isn't on the games industry. Either way that logic doesn't help sell/make better games. Well people can always just buy a playstation if it doesn't run well. Those games at the top are pretty light games. Though if no heavy games are made because it costs too much. Then it doesn't matter. So once again the solution is to buy a ps5 for heavier games like light dying light. I guess Thats simpler.  There also the fact that heavier games aren't going to be at the top as single players stories get 90% of their sales on launch. That is why dying light is up there near the top 10. So it's difficult to keep gauge. Also the second reason i suggest a ps5. People aren't going to play dying light when the rtx 6060 18gb comes out.

(i think) amd cpus auto shutoff at 100c, so at very least dont let it get that high. if it shuts off before the temp reaches the auto shutoff, then its not a temp issue. you could also try checking the windows crash logs, as sometimes gpu issues do similar things. most of the time, a gpu issue will cause a blue screen, but if the gpu isnt able to send video out, then the screen will go black before the bluescreen happens. my only other guess would maybe be a dying ssd (the storage drive containing your OS), but if the pc is relatively new, the ssd should be fine. but, before you go ripping anything apart, try plugging the pc into a different section of your homes power grid e.g. somewhere across the house, preferably somewhere where very few other things are plugged in. try it without the power strip too.",buildapc,2025-10-13 05:18:21,1,Neutral,Neutral,[],Tópico 3

AMD,niz8qwj,I think people need to understand that the x3D chips are only actually worth moving to in specific cases. Your case is one of those cases. You are pushing a quite large resolution and quite demanding. So unless you went for a much more powerful chip you were going to see issues. But because the x3D chips are designed to work much better with the GPU (specifically AMD ones) you get way better performance without needing a huge uplift in power.   Most people however are not pushing huge resolutions so an x3D chip is effectively wasted on their systems where just having a minorly newer chip would have been more than adequate.

AMD,nizf7pv,The thing to remember is that performance doesn’t really work that way. CPU performance usually doesn’t change really at all when you’re running a higher resolution. So the difference between 720p and 8K can be ridiculously minor on the CPU. So that’s one part.  Then there is obviously the discussion about how important a high-end CPU is for a 4K 60 experience for example especially now that we have frame gen and you can go to 4K 120 using that. That does make the CPU “less important” to the overall performance of a game.   That being said there’s another important factor that especially the X3D chips do very well and that is 1% and 0.1% lows. This is generally lump into a big category called frame health which is a sort of discussion about not only frame rate but also frame time variance and these release spiky stuttering frames.

AMD,nirkhnr,"They don't do ray traversal acceleration, but otherwise, RA units handle all of the geometry-level ray intersection tests (and OBB in RDNA4). The TMUs do ray/box tests. Even in Nvidia GPUs, RT is passed to compute cores once a hit is detected. So, while it's neat to lump everything into a logical diagram RT core, the actual logic will be placed where it makes most sense within the CU or SM. Ada's micro-meshes are geometry engine duties and displacement maps are ROP duties, for example.  RDNA4 is comparable to Ampere in path tracing, mostly due to traversals (shader compute cost) and geometry-level ray hits (path tracing launches a lot of rays that usually hit geometry or within the BLAS). Ray/triangle rates on both architectures are 2 ray/triangles per CU (AMD) or SM (Nvidia). In hybrid rendering (raster+RT), RDNA4 is at Ada Lovelace levels, as it can use its 8 ray/box tests per CU to narrow things down, and there's generally fewer rays cast, so the overall cost is lower as well. The rasterizers also build most of the screenspace too, and those plotted coordinates within screenspace can be used to better predict a ray hit. There's also a complete BVH structure residing in VRAM and system RAM, built by CPU and copied to VRAM or for APUs like Strix Halo, zero-copy.  Blackwell doubled ray/triangle rates over Ada, so it should be testing at 8 ray/triangles per SM. As more rays are cast, Blackwell should lead Ada assuming equal compute hardware, but it depends on other complexities like register and local cache usage.",AMD,2025-10-10 12:58:00,10,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9169023, 'word': 'RA', 'start': 57, 'end': 59}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4175906, 'word': 'R', 'start': 134, 'end': 135}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.74049884, 'word': 'N', 'start': 177, 'end': 178}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.49829826, 'word': '##vid', 'start': 178, 'end': 181}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.54066116, 'word': '##ia', 'start': 181, 'end': 183}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9853275, 'word': 'Ada', 'start': 394, 'end': 397}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5585371, 'word': 'R', 'start': 492, 'end': 493}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8066476, 'word': 'Am', 'start': 515, 'end': 517}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5366478, 'word': 'N', 'start': 779, 'end': 780}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.40871927, 'word': '##vid', 'start': 780, 'end': 783}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.4432217, 'word': 'R', 'start': 821, 'end': 822}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5563961, 'word': 'Ada Love', 'start': 833, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6416587, 'word': 'St', 'start': 1261, 'end': 1263}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.620255, 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 1267, 'end': 1271}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.560713, 'word': 'Blackwell', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1294}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.94728065, 'word': 'Ada', 'start': 1327, 'end': 1330}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7132316, 'word': 'Blackwell', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1415}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9796866, 'word': 'Ada', 'start': 1428, 'end': 1431}]",Tópico 2

So in a sense, it has a 100% cache hit rate, because it will always sample from nearby reservoirs, but one ""cache hit"" may end up contributing to 70% of the final frame color, while another may end up contributing 1%, depending on the PDF.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

AMD,ngcdph8,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Intel,2025-08-28 16:16:20,1,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7863968, 'word': 'RMA', 'start': 4, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99725705, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 20, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.9996716, 'word': 'Germany', 'start': 140, 'end': 147}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7773049, 'word': 'RMA', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9982186, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 518, 'end': 523}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.86127424, 'word': 'R', 'start': 739, 'end': 740}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.997638, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1079, 'end': 1084}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99489284, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1920, 'end': 1925}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

AMD,navj4sy,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Intel,2025-08-27 01:58:06,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9981675, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 60, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5757755, 'word': 'X', 'start': 142, 'end': 143}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9160963, 'word': 'X', 'start': 181, 'end': 182}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7241087, 'word': 'VROC', 'start': 213, 'end': 217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975128, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 316, 'end': 321}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9981376, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 362, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.71470153, 'word': 'X', 'start': 446, 'end': 447}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5083882, 'word': 'AS', 'start': 537, 'end': 539}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6538813, 'word': 'MS', 'start': 543, 'end': 545}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.75366527, 'word': 'G', 'start': 548, 'end': 549}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.848027, 'word': 'VROC', 'start': 631, 'end': 635}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7676257, 'word': 'X', 'start': 668, 'end': 669}]",Tópico 4
