Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",hardware,2025-11-06 18:17:12,-7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5722218), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 0, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.87760466), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 8, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9204128), 'word': 'BPD', 'start': 233, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9109275), 'word': 'A', 'start': 924, 'end': 925}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7746179), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 930, 'end': 935}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4222402), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 970, 'end': 972}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7283281), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1055, 'end': 1057}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975158), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7844832), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9260799), 'word': 'IP', 'start': 1177, 'end': 1179}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.60086036), 'word': 'Arrow lake', 'start': 1188, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9970722), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1248, 'end': 1253}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance.

Intel,netnyfa,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny.

Intel,nes030p,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,25,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99808574), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6214537), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.52357626), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99834645), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83350486), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99116546), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8770928), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99863094), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9641192), 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9881471), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96866584), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5841442), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980452), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99846077), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99331963), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81863767), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89312124), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982552), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47448224), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9968098), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972773), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961228), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 1

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614332), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.604474), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.420649), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713005), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 4

AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,19,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 4

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards).

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.

The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7806482), 'word': 'N', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49206084), 'word': '##vid', 'start': 290, 'end': 293}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.59018177), 'word': 'T', 'start': 312, 'end': 313}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8755103), 'word': 'Polarix', 'start': 348, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96025205), 'word': 'R', 'start': 361, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7545489), 'word': 'PSP', 'start': 567, 'end': 570}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4970201), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 631, 'end': 633}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4853362), 'word': '##on VII', 'start': 635, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.808714), 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 652, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85674083), 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 900, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7854365), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66929066), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8934808), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1491, 'end': 1494}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96433926), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1627, 'end': 1630}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.80651146), 'word': 'George', 'start': 1813, 'end': 1819}]",Tópico 2

It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility).

They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.949649), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378605), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84053415), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6853485), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 4

This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9945433), 'word': 'Nintendo', 'start': 23, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7072387), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 104, 'end': 108}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.736587), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 145, 'end': 149}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9411086), 'word': 'N', 'start': 262, 'end': 263}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99181014), 'word': 'C', 'start': 334, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7018669), 'word': '##UDA', 'start': 335, 'end': 338}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9394868), 'word': 'C', 'start': 595, 'end': 596}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.59285474), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 597, 'end': 599}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69475675), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 996, 'end': 999}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93300354), 'word': 'PyTorch', 'start': 1181, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8076242), 'word': 'AL', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1397}]",Tópico 2

Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff.

Intel,nnz3axo,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one.

In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games.

That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

AMD,nogei5r,"(Peak) Multi-thread performance is not necessarily the right way to look at the addition of more cores. Software support is just not mature enough with most approach still just trying to parallelize one task even well beyond reasonable scaling, making large core counts seem useless.  Once core counts where naive scaling approaches break too often become common, we'll start to see a shift revealing more benefits of having a lot of cores. Task preemption which was the foundation of modern complex systems may be eventually demoted to a last resort solution for keeping misbehaving processes in line.  Spreading processes to different cores generally reduces the peak performance requirement, so cores can be operated at a lower frequency, with lower voltage greatly increasing efficiency.  Tasks sticking to specific cores without getting preempted and moved around also increases efficiency, and reduces the occurrence and impact of worst case latency penalties.  Software is just way too behind hardware, but throwing faster hardware at the problem still works, so problems are not getting fixed. For example it's amusing to see that single CCD AMD CPUs are the most common for gaming, not because they are good enough, but because dual CCD CPUs just perform worse for the average gamer.  A Linux gaming setup with a container and/or Wine limited to a single CCD with the other CCD being used for the rest of the system is the superior approach to Windows bloatware services and background processes competing with the game for the resources of the same CCD, but the later is what's the easiest to setup/get for most users, so that's what they will plan builds for.  A lot of games also just spawn one software thread per hardware thread per thread manager, which stops reasonably scaling after a point. It may be worthy to even attempt to lie about having only 8 hardware threads, then spread around the mess on 8 cores with SMT more efficiently handling the overcommitment.  Browser loads may not be even worthy of a lot of analysis. Website design regressed to the point where latency hiding is intentionally prevented, and an incredible amount of bloatware logic is expected to be processed serially.",hardware,2025-11-12 13:51:38,5,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9476321), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1296, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9944273), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1453, 'end': 1460}]",Tópico 4

I'm not out of touch with more budget conscious people, but if it wasn't obvious, I wanted to point out that even the people who typically spend a lot more of minimal or only perceived benefit go with a single CCD this time, because on their setup (typical Windows gaming), 2 CCDs actually result in worse performance.  It's on software even to the point of Intel attempting to help the industry with best practices: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/optimizing-threading-for-gaming-performance.html (although this one gets more specific to their architecture, even if it still mentions concurrency limitations).  We are talking about the same scaling issue. A specific workload may scale reasonably up to 6 cores (and even that's 1-2 cores for more specialized work), a lot of code still just looks for the number of hardware threads, and creates the same number of software threads to be used in a thread pool specific to a layer, so in total the whole program will typically have more than 2-3x software threads than hardware threads available. This way you can even end up with more cores resulting in worse performance, even though they could be used to tend to the excessive number of software threads with less preemption, and therefore higher performance.",hardware,2025-11-12 17:39:40,6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998374), 'word': 'Windows 10', 'start': 224, 'end': 234}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9857713), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 358, 'end': 365}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.90268576), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 424, 'end': 429}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.94514465), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 540, 'end': 545}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82213277), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 659, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.84355503), 'word': 'Disco', 'start': 811, 'end': 816}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99189126), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1129, 'end': 1136}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9967354), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1230, 'end': 1235}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nmbgrrq,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,nmeds5z,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one.

AMD,nmbeqwq,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.

AMD and Intel GPUs run on open source drivers on Linux. Even all Nvidia RTX (GTX 16xx too) are getting more love on Linux nowadays.  Features and general improvements are still coming for Vega which I ran until recently. The oldest supported AMD GPUs on Linux are from the HD79xx series (real, not rebranded chips) from around 2012-2013 if I remember.   By supported I meant useful for daily use and normal consumers.  Meaning that all GPUs stated in the video are still completely fine, same goes for the USB-C output of the RX79xx.  In my eyes that's all planned obsolescence which here is irrelevant because of open source drivers. The corporations but also hundreds of free developers take part in.

AMD,nmbxqto,"> To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time.  To be clear, AMD is still providing drivers -- they're just not providing new game-specific driver-level optimizations.  I'm not sure how much this actually matters for older cards, since engine support for RDNA 2 and earlier should be pretty dialed-in to the point where driver-level optimizations shouldn't be as necessary. Not supporting new Vulkan extensions could potentially be problematic, but I'm also not sure it matters if these extensions are meant to support hardware that RDNA 2 cards (and earlier) don't have.  [Vega and Polaris are also in this ""extended support"" phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/17qn9e3/amd_begins_polaris_and_vega_gpu_retirement/), and looking at the driver pages for a Vega and Polaris card (I chose the Radeon VII and the Radeon RX 480), their latest driver update was in August 2025, which isn't that long ago.

Back with GCN the AMD architecture was a bit more complex and developers used it poorly. Developers did stupid things like tessellating concrete barriers and the surface of the water to hell and back. So over time you would have real gains and the AMD cards would have a better lifespan than their Nvidia counterparts. The RX 580 was phenomenal.  I would call the fine wine back in the day more shitty developers than shitty drivers.  Fine wine ended with RDNA, it was much simpler to optimize and all over the consoles. That means RX 5000 series going forward don't get those same bumps over time and we've seen it.  AMD fans repeating fine wine these days are talking about a golden age of Radeon that has long since ended without ever having experienced it themselves.

Then, after all that, the BEST they managed to do was copy Nvidia (-$50) by listing a fake MSRP, at least in the US, then lied about availability when claiming inventory issues were solely due to demand despite having warehouses full of cards for months from the delayed launch which was due to waiting for Nvidia pricing + selling ALL RDNA 3 inventory to milk RDNA 4 pricing (and not due to the expiring rebates they weren't going to provide retailers or the fact that AIBs would only sell models > $2-300 above MSRP).

This effectively means they no longer do development on the legacy branch.   Even in theory fixing bugs in old unmaintained code is difficult because it stops looking like the cold you're working on on a  regular basis. But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing. This happens quite frequently. These GPUs are only a few years old , some 5 years max.   >If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it.   They won't.

If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  They've never done this for the legacy Vega branch. It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.

I think that's a little bit unfair towards AMD. On the kernel side, they put in the work with amdgpu, writing parts of it from scratch *and* getting it being accepted into the mainline kernel - which is a steep barrier to entry (the battles on the LKML were a fascinating read :) ), but which makes long-term support infinitely more viable due to the nature of Linux kernel development.  On the userland side: While RADV of course has been and still is first and foremost Valve-driven, the no AMD involvement hasn't been true anymore for a while. AMD driver devs have actively contributed to RADV for a while now, and recently they had the saliency to make Mesa RADV the officially supported Vulkan driver, going so far as to actually discontinue AMDVLK.

Unlike the classic DisplayPort USB-C alternate mode, VirtualLink has no USB 2.0 channels active, instead providing a higher speed USB 3.1 Gen 2 (SuperSpeed+) over the same A6, A7, B7, B6 pins.

AMD,nmfdrzc,"> The adapter cable was originally meant to provide added convenience for Valve Index users, making it so they could rely on a single USB-C connection to the headset rather than requiring separate physical connections for video, USB, and power.  > However, for multiple technical reasons we no longer believe that the product would deliver that added convenience. Foremost on that list is reliability. Our current testing indicates the VR connection may fail to establish in a reliable manner. Additionally, Virtual Link technology has not been widely adopted by manufacturers, laptops in particular (where a single connection could be the most beneficial), translating to very few PCs having viable ports for the connection.  PSVR2 also does not use VirtualLink. It needs a port capable of DP Alt Mode and 12v USB PD. VirtualLink ports happen to be compatible. It's an important distinction. It doesn't repurpose the USB 2.0 data pins for 3.0 speeds, which is part of the VirtualLink spec and was the issue.   https://steamcommunity.com/app/992490/discussions/17/3879344463500344882/",hardware,2025-10-31 19:58:04,11,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99371576), 'word': 'Valve Index', 'start': 74, 'end': 85}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99561864), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 134, 'end': 137}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.969232), 'word': 'C', 'start': 138, 'end': 139}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9727367), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 229, 'end': 232}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.671678), 'word': 'V', 'start': 436, 'end': 437}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8672502), 'word': 'Virtual Link', 'start': 508, 'end': 520}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.63227373), 'word': 'PSVR', 'start': 727, 'end': 731}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6844166), 'word': 'VirtualLink', 'start': 751, 'end': 762}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9263536), 'word': 'D', 'start': 791, 'end': 792}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7745913), 'word': 'Mode', 'start': 798, 'end': 802}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8224616), 'word': 'USB PD', 'start': 811, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47668645), 'word': 'VirtualL', 'start': 819, 'end': 827}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62345296), 'word': '##ink', 'start': 827, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9779498), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 918, 'end': 921}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64587), 'word': 'VirtualL', 'start': 973, 'end': 981}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51471984), 'word': '##ink', 'start': 981, 'end': 984}]",Tópico 1

The main downside was that the BIOS was pretty clunky. Looked very dated, it was hard to find features that the board did have (enabling RAM EXPO was a bit fiddly, but to be fair once I enabled it it worked great with no tweaking required) and it listed features that the board didn't have (There was a toggle for Intel Turbo Boost and hyperthreading... on an AMD board...). The RGB software also was pretty bad, very few RGB modes, slow and unresponsive, and the installer was in Mandarin.

My end review is that the product itself was OK with a few QoL problems but nothing major, but it's totally worth spending another $20 to get something like a Gigabyte B650M Gaming, or an ASUS B650M AYW, just because BIOS and software will be better, you're far more likely to keep getting BIOS updates from a major brand, and if you ever need to warranty claim something I'd rather try my luck with a big brand over Maxsun.",hardware,2025-11-06 22:37:02,2,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65672684), 'word': 'Max', 'start': 15, 'end': 18}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5745012), 'word': '##sun', 'start': 18, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8185121), 'word': 'B65', 'start': 22, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8023405), 'word': 'Challenger Ice Wi', 'start': 28, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.89474946), 'word': 'Fi', 'start': 46, 'end': 48}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.971995), 'word': 'Aussie', 'start': 258, 'end': 264}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8845353), 'word': 'Intel Turbo Boost', 'start': 589, 'end': 606}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.92579794), 'word': 'R', 'start': 654, 'end': 655}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9442985), 'word': 'R', 'start': 697, 'end': 698}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99932516), 'word': 'Mandarin', 'start': 756, 'end': 764}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9988549), 'word': 'Western', 'start': 820, 'end': 827}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99924505), 'word': 'English', 'start': 874, 'end': 881}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7946327), 'word': 'G', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1045}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9917437), 'word': 'Maxsun', 'start': 1302, 'end': 1308}]",Tópico 1

I don't need the highest of qualities (1080p is fine for me, coming from a laptop with an i3 with 2 cores and integrated uhd graphics), as long as it can run games and my other needs smoothly, i can lose out on the 1440p or 4k. All I need it to do is run Ultra 1080p on games, I'll even settle for high considering anything other than ""the lowest possible settings"" is where I'm at currently. I'd ignore it and go with my gut but after a very quick search I saw the 9070 is quite a bit faster than the 9060, but once again, if the 9060 can handle what I need it too at 1080p ultra/high, I will take it for $200 less.  Notes: ~~I see when I put all this into the PCPartPicker website that I get the message ""The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition 42 CFM CPU Cooler may require a separately available mounting adapter to fit the Gigabyte B850 GAMING X WIFI6E ATX AM5 Motherboard."" Is this anything to actually be concerned about?~~    Ignore. Accidentally scrolled up to my list and put that cooler in instead of the one you put.  Other than those three things, I thank you for putting this together for me! Especially the explanations of why the parts are chosen. If you could get back to me with the answers to my questions then I would appreciate it. Also just for clarification, these things should last right?

Running cpuz bench at the same time with BF6 to max the CPU and GPU I saw max 405W AC or 365W once the CPU package was at 130W.  9070XT is 100W more than a 4070S so 100% utilization would be no more than 465W.

DDR5 launch spec were slower than DDR4 because of similar or just a little bitter speeds but loose timings. And DDR6 might come with a similar problem as well.  I’m totally in for Zen7 being released for both AM5 & AM6, not just to make AM5 last longer but to give consumers the option, especially that going AM6 will be expensive for early adopters making Zen7 adoption slow if it was AM6 exclusive.  As for AM6, I really really hope it comes with extra PCIe lanes, like 4-8 lanes, I would hope for 12-16 but it not realistic unless they limit those 12-16 lanes to high end chipsets only (the E series) and can target workstation/server grade motherboards too. Currently AM5 high end, server & workstation grade motherboards are boring because of this, and the only way to get more PCIe lanes is to jump to Threadripper which is a very big jump considering how much more expensive it became compared to first generation Threadripper.",AMD,2025-11-12 13:28:18,4,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8766886), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 22, 'end': 26}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9805176), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 87, 'end': 90}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76827276), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 141, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8970592), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 148, 'end': 150}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.53693306), 'word': '##6', 'start': 151, 'end': 152}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9846577), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 190, 'end': 192}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93045944), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 223, 'end': 225}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8154477), 'word': 'DDR', 'start': 257, 'end': 260}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75023794), 'word': 'DDR6', 'start': 335, 'end': 339}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9037739), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 403, 'end': 407}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.918123), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 580, 'end': 584}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6317048), 'word': 'E', 'start': 817, 'end': 818}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.43840832), 'word': 'T', 'start': 1031, 'end': 1032}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60665923), 'word': '##rip', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1040}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.56100273), 'word': 'T', 'start': 1144, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.41042143), 'word': '##rip', 'start': 1150, 'end': 1153}]",Tópico 1

AMD,noisgw3,">I also think AM6 will be when DDR6 is ready.  I agree. That'd line up with how AMD's been doing things since the AM2 days.  >Might be they release a AM5+ with PCIe6 and more USB4  Given what they've been doing since Ryzen 3000 series, i think i'd be more likely that they do it as a chipset thing, a la 500 series chipsets supporting PCIe 4.0 on AM4. You could use Zen 5000 series chips on 300 series chipsets with the appropiate BIOS version, in some cases, you'd also lose support for older parts, and the newer CPU may become limited to the PCIe version of the Motherboard (3000 or newer CPUs being limited to PCIe 3.0 on 400 or older boards)   AM5 may go a simillar route, the upgrade path is one of the things that are attractive about AMD so I don't think they'll revise the socket until DDR6 is a thing, and they move onto AM6. Before Ryzen, there was some compatibility between regular AM2 and AM3 sockets/CPUs and the + versions, but it was a bit of a mess. I don't think AMD would want to go back to that.   The 800 and 600 series chipsets are confusing enough already. B850 supports PCIe 5 while B840 doesn't and B650E does   What i could see happening if Zen 7 comes out before DDR6: 900 Series chipset with PCIe 6 and more USB 4 lanes (, as long as the CPU supports it) still on the AM5 socket.",AMD,2025-11-12 21:02:46,10,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113265), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 14, 'end': 16}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91382694), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 31, 'end': 33}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.68773067), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 80, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66252136), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 175, 'end': 178}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.60299486), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 335, 'end': 337}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97057503), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 366, 'end': 369}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5629545), 'word': '##board', 'start': 571, 'end': 576}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9189589), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 742, 'end': 745}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8242035), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 795, 'end': 797}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80544937), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 895, 'end': 897}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77103585), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 903, 'end': 905}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97952133), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 982, 'end': 985}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.94337845), 'word': 'Zen 7', 'start': 1168, 'end': 1173}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9079434), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 1191, 'end': 1193}]",Tópico 2

It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware?

Meanwhile, the D: drive should focus on capacity before spending more money to upgrade from PCIe Gen 3 to PCIe Gen 4 or higher.  PCIe Gen 3 is fast enough for this storage drive.  Essentially, I expect the C: drive to fail.  I can easily do a clean reinstall of Windows and then reconnect the user folders to the existing D: drive folders.  The only folders I risk losing are the ""appdata"" folders.  Everything else, I can download and replace.  My clean reinstall of Windows is basically deleting all the partitions from the C: drive and continuing.  My general configuration recommendation for cost effectiveness:  C: Drive - 250GB NVMe SSD PCIe Gen 4 speeds at minimum - I normally recommend 500GB due to Windows.   \- Stores Windows, drivers, tiny replaceable programs, temporary data.  Don't store anything you can't replace  D: Drive - 1 to 2TB NVMe SSD, PCIe Gen 3 - Don't pay extra for faster than Gen 3 speeds, you won't see it.   \- Stores major applications and files considered irreplaceable  E: Drive - 4TB and larger HDD - SSDs of 4TB and larger are expensive.     \-  SATA and HDD can handle many games with little issue, and you can migrate unused Steam games to the HDD to save space on the D: Drive.  OS functions are what typically kills the performance for an HDD.  All of your media files like music and videos can easily run from an HDD.  The HDD is still faster than downloading.",AMD,2025-11-13 13:00:25,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8957928), 'word': 'Virtual RAM', 'start': 93, 'end': 104}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99371237), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 419, 'end': 426}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85325754), 'word': 'C', 'start': 432, 'end': 433}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7737205), 'word': 'C', 'start': 551, 'end': 552}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77131724), 'word': 'D', 'start': 577, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91851455), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 654, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9778189), 'word': 'Gen 3', 'start': 659, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85270274), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 668, 'end': 670}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9356131), 'word': 'Gen 4', 'start': 673, 'end': 678}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6800607), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 691, 'end': 693}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96839154), 'word': 'Gen 3', 'start': 696, 'end': 701}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8582733), 'word': 'C', 'start': 768, 'end': 769}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.94965464), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 824, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77153885), 'word': 'D', 'start': 884, 'end': 885}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95799625), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1030, 'end': 1037}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75234956), 'word': 'Gen', 'start': 1210, 'end': 1213}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9406121), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1270, 'end': 1277}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95916), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1291, 'end': 1298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77544093), 'word': 'Gen 3', 'start': 1428, 'end': 1433}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8439455), 'word': '3', 'start': 1472, 'end': 1473}]",Tópico 2

AMD,nomqkkd,"u/lelldorianx, think you guys need to look into this.   >It has been noticed and posted [multiple](https://techestigate.com/amd-ati-drivers-filling-up-space-on-system-disk-in-eeudumps-folder/) [times](https://github.com/GSDragoon/RadeonSoftwareSlimmer/discussions/140) by [different](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1brnh5c/constant_writes_to_windowssystem32amdeeudumps/) [people](https://pc-help.cnews.cz/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=226514), that AMD's drivers constantly writes to logfiles in `C:\Windows\System32\AMD\EEUDumps\`. Yesterday I found out, just how bad it really is. I have recorded a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw1yN0eq5zw  In the video, I have a program running that records every change to the hard drive (using [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-readdirectorychangesw)) Every new line in the console window is a modification of the file. Notice how they completely stop when I disable the ""AMD External Events Utility"" service.   Every time you move a window or resize a window on your desktop, those files get modified multiple (hundreds!) of times.  The writes seem to be caused by the service ""AMD External Events Utility"", disabling it immediately stops the writes. Apparently this service handles things like [FreeSync](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/8bvcfo/do_not_disable_amd_external_events_utility/) which has been confirmed by an AMD engineer.  There might be other oocasions, where the files are written to, but these are the most egregious situations I could find.  Nowadays, of course, most people will use SSDs, especially for their system drives. SSDs have a limited amount of bytes written before they inevitably degrade and die. Now just think about how much lifespan AMD takes of SSDs globally doing this. In my research I found that this has been an ongoing issue for multiple years.  Fun fact: I run an NVIDIA graphics card, but an AMD processor, and the chipset drivers apparently also include this service.  Testing for yourself: I've created a simple tool to watch for writes to that Folder. You can download it from my [GitHub](https://github.com/tGecko/AMD-EeuDumps)   I have kept the code simple and GitHub compiles it automatically, so it's guaranteed that the .exe represents the code in `AMD-EeuDumps.c` and can easily be verified. Your Browser and Windows will probably complain about the file, simply because it's an unknown .exe. Alternatively, compile the exe yourself from the source code using `cl.exe /O2 /Fe:AMD-EeuDumps.exe AMD-EeuDumps.c`  Workaround: I applied [this](https://github.com/GSDragoon/RadeonSoftwareSlimmer/discussions/140#discussion-7792873) workaround, redirecting writes to the whole folder to nul: so they never touch the disk. It seems to be working fine for me, but apply it at your own risk.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 2

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

AMD,n0ap7lk,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

AMD,n046z2m,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Intel,2025-06-27 19:06:33,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82722825), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 146, 'end': 148}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.58519953), 'word': 'Mac', 'start': 253, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96073776), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 338, 'end': 340}]",Tópico 1

AMD,n049nak,"I take no side there. I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).
