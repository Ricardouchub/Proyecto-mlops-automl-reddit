Intel,nito8rq,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads.

Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent.

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance.

Intel,netnyfa,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny.

Intel,nes030p,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,27,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99808574), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6214537), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.52357626), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99834645), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83350486), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99116546), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8770928), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99863094), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9641192), 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9881471), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96866584), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5841442), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980452), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99846077), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99331963), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81863767), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89312124), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982552), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47448224), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9968098), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972773), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961228), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 3

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614332), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.604474), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.420649), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713005), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 2

AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

For not much more money, at around $550, you can get a 9600X, a B850 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5.   If RAM prices weren't skyrocketing like they currently are, you could have gotten a basic AM5 setup for around $450 a few weeks ago. Some of the price hike can be explained by RAM chips being purchased for AI, due to many many data centers popping up all over major cities. But also can be explained by the upcoming holiday season in a few short weeks. Its a common trend now - you can use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel or PCPartpicker to look at the pricing trend.   Its not really ideal to move to AM4, especially buying brand new parts - the cost difference is in AM5's favor even with the DDR5 price hike. Any better CPU upgrade down the line would require you to jump to a new platform anyway, which means CPU/MOBO/RAM at a minimum.   Hell, if you're willing to wait a few weeks to see what the holiday ""sales"" bring. (more people are becoming aware that a few weeks before the holiday season price hikes tend to happen so that things like Black Friday and Christmas sales make you believe you're getting a good deal)  Starting off with something like the 9600X build I listed below will give you far more longevity, and the socket itself will have 1 or 2 more CPU generations so you'll still have an upgrade path even if something like AM6 comes out.

I think that applications that you would normally run locally should at minimum be *available* for local use, if not exclusively done that way, but for anything that's normally hosted remotely anyways, it makes sense at a high level to concentrate them in data centers and allocate resources as needed rather than having everyone try and purchase and maintain physical servers. The main issue I have with it is that it's controlled by private corporations. A network run by some kind of non profit coalition or something to that effect that sells the computing time essentially at cost and with redundant data centers in every region would save a lot of people time and money on server maintenance, space, and the actual cost of the physical servers without giving control of it to a private entity.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-29 19:29:30,1,Neutral,Neutral,[],Tópico 1

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",AMD,2024-10-30 19:35:13,1,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8982759), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9951883), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 14, 'end': 17}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8116601), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 134, 'end': 140}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943714), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 298, 'end': 301}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972882), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 378, 'end': 383}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99413234), 'word': 'PS5 Pro', 'start': 429, 'end': 436}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76614684), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 642, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66854084), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 680, 'end': 683}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9977957), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 867, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9570879), 'word': 'Mac', 'start': 982, 'end': 985}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.54528177), 'word': 'Surface', 'start': 1172, 'end': 1179}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67134994), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 1180, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.63227135), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1203}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83286864), 'word': 'MacBook', 'start': 1219, 'end': 1226}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99239796), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 1264, 'end': 1273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.851015), 'word': 'Office', 'start': 1297, 'end': 1303}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82443964), 'word': 'Surface', 'start': 1382, 'end': 1389}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.89342076), 'word': 'MacBook', 'start': 1428, 'end': 1435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8903414), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1478, 'end': 1481}]",Tópico 1

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,68,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98579425), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6807291), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.53338933), 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8288868), 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8976541), 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87239146), 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87449735), 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52110374), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.63087755), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9507805), 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5053189), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8337852), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69437224), 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5678201), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6214103), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6280626), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 4

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.949649), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378605), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84053415), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6853485), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 1

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9452912), 'word': 'Lenovo', 'start': 223, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8261307), 'word': 'Hogwartz', 'start': 805, 'end': 813}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9086967), 'word': 'Rachet', 'start': 815, 'end': 821}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6654186), 'word': 'Clank', 'start': 826, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.72740483), 'word': 'Re', 'start': 833, 'end': 835}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8370989), 'word': '2', 'start': 841, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9770279), 'word': 'O', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1467}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nirs4bu,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads.

Intel,nixt1zv,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,niy0ck1,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

Intel,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nmbgrrq,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.       AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.       There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.      If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it.

Videocardz is speculating, but it seems like AMD's workaround is to use an ancient (in terms of games) driver, so it's seemingly working just fine in **some** drivers.  //  The real problem: some bidirectional USB-C to DisplayPort cables [**require** power output on the USB-C port](https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/gh6w4e/comment/k4ugi44/):  >REVERSIBLE CABLE: This 6.6ft/2m DisplayPort to USB-C bidirectional cable connects your USB-C Laptop to a DisplayPort Monitor or DisplayPort device to a USB Type-C display; Note: **USB-C port (computer or monitor) must support Power Delivery (minimum 5V)**  Here, USB-C GPU to DisplayPort monitor would mean *only* the GPU can provide power and now these cables may no longer work properly.",hardware,2025-10-30 17:08:51,71,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98358136), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 4, 'end': 7}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.79475373), 'word': 'RX', 'start': 63, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99544454), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 87, 'end': 90}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96844697), 'word': 'C', 'start': 91, 'end': 92}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7487611), 'word': 'type', 'start': 180, 'end': 184}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6164516), 'word': 'C', 'start': 185, 'end': 186}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9808791), 'word': 'type', 'start': 223, 'end': 227}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.62930524), 'word': 'C', 'start': 228, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9490324), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 370, 'end': 373}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9326438), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 496, 'end': 499}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8857325), 'word': 'Videocardz', 'start': 510, 'end': 520}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95814943), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 555, 'end': 558}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99667054), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 720, 'end': 723}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.983904), 'word': 'C', 'start': 724, 'end': 725}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9450487), 'word': 'DisplayPort', 'start': 729, 'end': 740}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99563724), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 781, 'end': 784}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97389406), 'word': 'C', 'start': 785, 'end': 786}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6968434), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 900, 'end': 902}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6323637), 'word': '##layPort', 'start': 904, 'end': 911}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98859763), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 915, 'end': 918}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9622382), 'word': 'C', 'start': 919, 'end': 920}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9937443), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 955, 'end': 958}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96708995), 'word': 'C', 'start': 959, 'end': 960}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.74849933), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 973, 'end': 975}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.73631436), 'word': '##splayPort Monitor', 'start': 975, 'end': 992}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8360008), 'word': 'DisplayPort', 'start': 996, 'end': 1007}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98281145), 'word': 'USB Type', 'start': 1020, 'end': 1028}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98644257), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1029, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9828409), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 1048, 'end': 1051}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9553997), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1052, 'end': 1053}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.52879316), 'word': 'Power Del', 'start': 1094, 'end': 1103}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98966587), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 1131, 'end': 1134}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80850357), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1135, 'end': 1136}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91846764), 'word': 'DisplayPort', 'start': 1144, 'end': 1155}]",Tópico 4

From what the researchers are saying, client-side SGX used to use non-deterministic encryption; however, as the scope of protected memory ballooned (esp with TDX's use case on server), that shifted to deterministic encryption to limit the performance impact for memory regions that large.

AMD,nkpn3ce,"The lower cache is why the requests have to be made frequently.  You have 96MB of L3 on one CCD, and 32MB on the other CCD.  If a thread on the latter needs data cached on the former, it will retrieve it over the IF link, which is slower than a local cached read, but still faster than a DRAM access (which is why the request is made in the first place).  That will then be the newest line of memory, being stored in the L1/L2 of the core that requested it, kicking out the oldest line into the L3, which in turn kicks out the oldest L3 line.  When that latter evicted line is needed again, it will have to be refetched.  It's still likely in the L3 of the first CCD, due to that being triple the size, so it will be requested over the IF link again.    But if both cache sizes are the same, then that scenario will happen much less often.  Both CCD's will end up having mostly the same cache lines stored locally, and only if the data is invalidated (which won't happen to most of the read-only memory involved with running a game) would there need to be a cross-CCD transfer for the same cache line.  There's still room for particular code to not run all that well in that scenario, but it's likely uncommon.  Worst case scenario, you just relegate such a game to a single CCD using *Process Lasso* or some other means of managing process affinity on the fly.  All of this is obvious when you compare the performance of non-X3D 16-core parts to the equivalent 8-core part.  In nearly all games, there's no real difference.

Lots of E cores is better for more parallel work, but if you have too few P cores that can hurt performance due to [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law).  The thing about Amdahl's law is once you have enough parallel processors the task becomes dominated by the single thread part of the work, which is the setting it up and collecting the results and showing them to the user/storing them. So the ideal future involves the right amount of P cores to as many E cores as possible, but if you have too few P cores and that work ends up on E cores it will hurt performance. Too many P cores and you end up with less performance in the parallel part of the work.  Heterogenous cores is thus the obvious future as things become more concurrent and we use more parallel algorithms. Get the balance wrong and performance will suffer, we need just enough P cores to run the E cores.

AMD,nm7vprb,"I think that the exact motives for heterogeneous solutions vary from case to case.  E.g. if you look at AMD vs Intel, I think that Intel went with a heterogeneous design because they didn't have any other way to compete with AMD. AMD's Zen cores were already quite power efficient, while Intel was stuck with older designs for older nodes that were more power hungry, so they could not scale up the number of cores without making a power monster (plus it wouldn't fit on a reasonably priced die). Their solution became a hybrid design with a few powerful cores and a few less powerful cores.  In the case of Intel, it's quite clear that it was an emergency solution. They basically took two more or less readily available cores and put them on the same die. One quirk that came from that was that even if the bigger cores had some CPU extensions (some AVX instructions for instance), the smaller cores didn't. That meant that processes and threads could not be migrated from big cores to small cores without possibly crashing. IIRC the solution was simply to disable the advanced instructions in the big cores and have a more crippled CPU.  One observation that has been made in recent times is that in a multi-core CPU, you don't really need that many fast cores for your system to run fine. I think that Linus Torvalds expressed it something like this: ""The important thing is that the efficiency cores do not suck"" (i.e. that there's not an order of magnitude difference in performance, because then scheduling becomes really difficult).  For Apple I think they come from another reality, where their big-little design was first made for phones and tablets, where battery life is a key design goal. There it's important to have cores that draw little power to extend battery life as much as possible, and only use the big cores for interactive foreground processes for instance.",hardware,2025-10-30 16:38:35,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9815543), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 104, 'end': 107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.998727), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 111, 'end': 116}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9984242), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 131, 'end': 136}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9874112), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 225, 'end': 228}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922285), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 230, 'end': 233}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8964151), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 236, 'end': 239}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99835205), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 288, 'end': 293}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9984931), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 608, 'end': 613}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6491335), 'word': 'A', 'start': 852, 'end': 853}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9836706), 'word': 'IIRC', 'start': 1027, 'end': 1031}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.48423728), 'word': 'Lin', 'start': 1306, 'end': 1309}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.8895213), 'word': '##us Torval', 'start': 1309, 'end': 1318}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99795145), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1546, 'end': 1551}]",Tópico 3

AMD,nm7yhso,"You basically said it, e Cores don't make much sense in a low power design.  More general, the are two aspects that a CPU architecture can be designed around: throughput and latency.   Throughput means how much work can you do in a given amount of time and latency focuses on how much time do you need to finish a task.   Even though they seem to be similar, they're not. Power consumption scales with the square of clock speed. Increasing clockspeed by 2x requires 4x power, so you either have 1 core twice as fast or 4 cores running at the same speed. That's extremely oversimplified but gives a rough estimation on why it's generally much easier to get good throughput over latency.  Apart from that there are interconnects. CPUs cores share memory and caches to some degree and in todays designs, moving data typically costs more energy than compute does.   It's a complicated topic and I strongly recommend this [Video](https://youtu.be/8teWvMXK99I?si=i4BrzCp6kjsZn8RW) by Dr.Cutress which goes over the intrerconnect basics. Long story short, the more cores/hops you add your design the worse latencies get.   And that's also a reason why intel uses e cores. Intel generally targets latency more than throughput while AMD typically focuses more on throughput (there are exceptions on both). But still, both try to reduce latency as much as possible, both designs have their advantages and drawbacks.  Intel uses a high speed ring to connect their cores. Problem is that adding more hops will increase latency. Fun fact if you look at more technical analyses of Alder Lake, you'll find that the 6 core dies usually come with better core to core, cache and memory latencies than their high end many core designs do. To enable higher core counts, which are mostly useful for throughput heavy tasks anyway, they group 4 e cores into one hop on the ring. That means they can add 4 cores that have more throughput than 1 big core while only increasing throughput as much as adding one more core which is a pretty good idea.   But all that is only really useful on higher end parts, for low core count or limited power scenarios it's not that useful. Even though their marketing did present it a little bit different the e cores were never really about efficiency in low power scenarios.  AMD solves this problem quite different: They only build 8 core ""cpus"" and ""glue"" them together on one package and connect them through a cache coherent interface. Topology wise they act more like older dual socket systems before the North bridge was integrated into the chip. The IOD is basically the north bridge and each CCD acts like a CPU socket would but all at much higher speeds and lower latencies. But there are still issues.   The cache is only coherent, not shared. If both CCDs work on the same memory, the data in stored in both caches as copies. That's also the reason why the Ryzen 9 CPUs have twice the cache over Ryzen 7 CPUs but don't see any benefit in gaming from that. If anything, the coherent caches hurts low latency applications like gaming.   AMD ""fixes"" that by disabling one CCD in those tasks. And that's also one the reasons why Zen 3 improved so much in gaming: they went from 4 core CCX to 8 core CCX which also doubled the effective cache. Instead of 2x 16MB it was 1x 32MB since then.  So, heterogenous designs are relevant for scaling performance on the desktop.   In mobile systems, it can also be used to reduce power draw but that's an entirely different thing.  ARMs big.LITTLE which is often falsely compared to intels design works entirely different from what intel and AMD are doing. The orginal big.LITTLE was more like power settings than anything else.     Edit: Technically every single SMT/hyperthreading CPU is heterogeneous. From the OS perspective SMT is much more heterogeneous and a much bigger issue than big.LITTLE ever was.",hardware,2025-10-30 16:51:51,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.7996755), 'word': 'Cutress', 'start': 981, 'end': 988}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985335), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1165, 'end': 1170}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9959678), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1224, 'end': 1227}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99829036), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1407, 'end': 1412}]",Tópico 3

CPU rendering is useless. The only streamers that even have such bitrates available to stream at, at the ones who are pulling in tens thousands of viewers each stream, whom are on a consistent schedule that justifies the platform in unlocking that ability. And even most of those aren't game streamers, they're talking heads with a mostly static image coming from their $800+ DSLR face cam.   The average streamer, even if you run a podcast that has 1-5k viewers every stream... are usually locked to 6000 and below. I think on Twitch you're limited to a bitrate of 3500 and only until you meet certain thresholds will they even allow you to hit 6000.    The only time anyone should be using their CPU to encode for streaming, is when you're running a dual-PC streaming setup so that 1 PC runs the stream, alerts, overlays and transitions, recording and transcoding - so that the gaming PC's resources are not taking away from the performance of the gaming PC. And even then in a dual-PC setup - its just better to be letting the GPU on the Stream PC to be doing all that work.",buildapc,2025-10-27 15:18:37,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.45097333), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 341, 'end': 343}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80211556), 'word': 'DS', 'start': 953, 'end': 955}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6670094), 'word': '##witch', 'start': 1106, 'end': 1111}]",Tópico 1
AMD,nlkyzwy,"Hmmm, let's  think.  The Ultra 9 is on a platform that has no future, it's ""dead"", there is no opportunity to drop in the next gen Intel cpu.  The Ultra trails both your current cpu in many games and it trails many of the AMD cpu's.   The Ultra is obliterated by the AMD x3d chips.    The one advantage the Ultra has is in productivity apps.  The 9950x3d goes toe to toe with the Ultra 9 in productivity apps:  a little faster in some, a little slower in others.  The Ultra cannot compare with the 9950x3d in gaming.  The vcache side of 9950x3d is actually a 9800x3d. The 9950x3d also obliterates the Ultra in gaming, because, well it is a 9800x3d when gaming.  Both the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d are on the AM5 platform.  AMD will run its next generation of cpu's, Zen6, on the AM5 platform.  Reliable sources report that Zen7 will also be AM5.  If you go with a chip setting on the AM5 platform (e.g. 9950x3d), you have the opportunity to simply drop in a Zen6 then a Zen7 cpu and have a modern and relevant machine for another 5+ years.  Intel only dreams of this!  The price delta between the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d is about $200.  If you have any doubts, get the 9950x3d.   Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.    I was considering a 9800x3d vs a 9950x3d, I went with the 9950x3d.   Precisely because I want to know I have the flexibility to do more than game.  From a price to performance ratio for gaming, the 9800x3d is the winner.

It still wasn't *quite* as good as Intel's best at the time, but it was getting better. And because AMD was fabless, they could use the latest fab technology and not have to implement it themselves. So while Intel was more-or-less stuck on their endless refinement of the 14nm process in 2021, AMD was releasing Ryzen 5000 on 7nm. Intel did somewhat come back with their 12th gen CPUs, but then stumbled again as their panic releases took them in continually bad areas.

AMD,nm9lnn8,"AMD, in general, is just as good as intel for everything.  Their X3D CPUs are better for gaming than intel CPUs, but come at a premium.  The non-X3D CPUs are just on par.  That said, AMD's AM4 socket had a long life and AM5 will have at least one more generation of CPU before the switch to AM6.  Intel's current socket is done and will be replaced next year.  Most people recommend AM5 because of the potential to upgrade the CPU in the future is perceived to be higher.  If you are not someone who upgrades CPUs, it isn't really an issue.  Intel's core Ultra 2s are price/performance competitive (for the most part) with their AMD counterparts (excluding X3D for gaming).  Also, intel got a black eye with the way they handled the voltage spike degradation issue in the 13th and 14th gen K series CPU.  It isn't like AMD didn't have a somewhat similar issue with 7800X3Ds the year before (they did, but they addressed it a bit quicker and a bit more openly than intel did).  Also, on the upgrade front, recently there have been a few threads where people have asked about upgrading their AM4 CPUs and people are telling them to switch to AM5 for upgrade-ability, which kind of defeats the purpose of buying AM4 for upgrade-ability five or six years ago.  So, once AM6 comes out, the same people that are telling you to buy AM5 for ""upgrade-ability"" are going to tell you to just switch to AM6 when you ask them what AM5 CPU you should upgrade to 😉  My take is that if you are someone who has to have the latest and greatest and are likely to upgrade your CPU in the next year or two, go with AMD and AM5.  If all you do is gaming and you can afford the X3D premium price, go with AMD.  Otherwise, go with whatever you fancy.  By the time you upgrade, you'll be replacing the motherboard and memory (DDR6!) anyway.

AMD,nm9xxqf,"Setting aside any other functionality of the chip, because right now AMD is very competitive and in a lot of cases just better than Intel, let me give you the main reason why you should ONLY build your computer with AMD, and NEVER buy Intel if you can help it, with the ONLY exception being if someone is giving you an Intel motherboard and CPU for less than $100...   **Motherboards and CPUs are expensive.**  Even my used x870 and 7600X, on sale, cost me over $300: and you don't want to have to spend this kind of money every couple years just to upgrade the computer.   **Intel**, for at least a couple decades, has been doing anti-consumer crap where they purposefully make a new socket every couple years, forcing you to buy a new motherboard if you want to upgrade your CPU, with methods as absurd as arbitrarily changing the pin locations on their sockets so that even though the socket is functionally the same the two CPUs won't work in it.  There was even an absurd situation less than 10 years ago where you could upgrade your CPU by just using tape or bits of metal to arbitrarily cover or bridge connections to make the motherboard think it was a different CPU, because apparently they were cutting performance based on that.   **AMD**, meanwhile, just released another round of CPUs for the AM4 socket, which already held the record for the longest supported socket: everything from the ryzen 1000 series to the 5000 series works on that socket, meaning if you have a computer with a Ryzen 1500, you can upgrade it right now to a Ryzen 5950 X3D, assuming the power control supports that wattage.  Note that they came out with the AM5 socket a couple years ago, meaning ***AMD is still making new CPUs for a socket they aren't even pushing anymore.  Even the first AM4 socket computers can upgraded to support Windows 11 without buying a new Motherboard, CPU, and RAM.***  The AM5 socket is charted to be similar, with the 11000 and 13000 series slated for it.   Once again, **motherboards and CPUs are expensive.**  You don't want a CPU socket you can't upgrade.  Even if Ryzen processors weren't performing better than Intel processors, even if there was some known problem with them (like there is with Intel right now), if your motherboard has an AM5 socket, you could always go buy a newer one in a couple years.  Personally, I have a plan to replace this older Ryzen 5 with a 9800X3D or even a 11800X3D when the price gets dropped by newer CPUs coming out... And I won't have to replace the motherboard to do that, because I got a mid-range X870 with full PCIe5 support, meaning it was MADE to handle those CPUs to their full potential.   This is in contrast with my last few Intels I got on deals: the CPU no longer cuts it, and there's no option to upgrade, sometimes even within the *same generation.*  With my AMD?  No more problem.  If the CPU isn't cutting it (and it is, because the 7600X is excellent for the price point), I just go drop another couple hundred on a newer and better one.    This is just basic math: future me will be able to afford a newer CPU WAY sooner than a full-on motherboard, CPU, and potentially RAM.   Even if there's some reason to upgrade the motherboard, I can do that without buying a new CPU, because it's all the same socket.   **Side Note:**   I run Linux, which AMD has better support for in both CPUs and especially GPUs, so Fuck Nvidia, I'm recommending AMD for GPUs too.   **TLDR:** Don't make the mistake of boxing yourself in like I've done in the past, go with the company that is making sockets that last, and spend a little more on the motherboard now so you aren't buying a new one in a couple years.  YOU WILL SPEND LESS MONEY TO GET MORE.",buildapc,2025-10-30 22:46:52,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5551286), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 69, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98953336), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 132, 'end': 137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9765707), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 235, 'end': 240}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84266984), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 319, 'end': 324}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98412734), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 576, 'end': 581}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83229357), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1244, 'end': 1246}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7755497), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1499, 'end': 1500}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77345717), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1545, 'end': 1546}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.42479518), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1824, 'end': 1831}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80953944), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 2135, 'end': 2140}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nm9iek1,"AMD has a lead with their 3d cache technology which significantly helps frame rate in low resolution gaming.  Intel's 14900K was (initially) the king of last generation.  Trading blows in gaming benchmarks with the 7800x3d, while having double the productivity/rendering.  Then some people discovered that the CPUs were failing.  The cpus were running at too high voltage and damaging themselves (degrading)  By all reasonable accounts, it was about 5% of the chips, which is *way* too many, but not as ultimately devastating as the techtoobers would have you believe.    Intel released microcode which limits voltage spike potential, and offer 5yr warranty on these parts.  They did the right thing, but due to the nature of the problem people don't really know if it was solved for good.  Many people suspect they will continue to degrade although we haven't heard any recent reports to this affect, so probably fixed.  The 9800x3d introduced a lead over the 7800x3d (and 14900K) and simultaneously Intel released a new generation of CPU that is great for productivity, but worse than their 14th gen at gaming.  In the span of about 1.5 years they went from top dog to ""budget king"", much like AMD has been since it's inception.  Because of the fab situation, people generally don't see how Intel is going to catch up.  That said, a 14900K or 14700K on deep sale is going to be the best all around gaming/productivity value.  And the core ultra series (also heavily discounted) is a top performing productivity processor at bargain price.  Unfortunately, Intel just couldn't keep up with TMSC fabs and 3d cache technology used by AMD.

AMD,nm9dlu7,"> Ryzen was released way before Apple dropped Intel.  Fair enough - my memory was such that it was around the same time. But it looks like Apple dumped Intel in 2020 and Ryzen came out in 2017. Still the point stands - Apple was a HUGE customer for Intel, and losing them meant that they had a lot less money to throw at R&D like they had done in the past (i.e. the last time AMD was kicking their ass, they supposedly spent more in R&D than AMD's entire market valuation and somewhat violently took the performance crown back from AMD with the Core2 series).   And I believe I covered that the initial Ryzen releases weren't as good as Intel's options at the time, but they were a VAST improvement over Bulldozer. The point I was making was that they could rapidly improve their designs because they could use other company's fabs and didn't have to deploy new process tech on their own, having spun off Glo-Fo years earlier.   > The 13900k that I'm running is a fine chip and it could certainly handle itself against amd when it came out.  Right. That's why I mentioned that Intel recovered somewhat with the 12th gen, the 13th gen would be included in that (if you somewhat ignore the degradation issue with Raptor Lake silicon). Their rapid slide, however, continued with the panic release of the 14th ""gen"", which was basically an overclock of the 13th gen silicon.   > For gaming the x3D chips are best but they only have 8 cores and are mediocre workstations. They're not all rounders in that sense.  ...Right. That would be why I mentioned that ""for gaming they basically left Intel in the dust."" And also why literally the second sentence I wrote in that initial comment was that ""there are still situations where an Intel unit is a better choice, but those are somewhat rare.""

AMD,nm9hwpw,"I don't really get why it's so important for you to affirm all the things you got right. I wasn't trying to put you down or anything just pointing out the discrepancy between the ryzen release and the apple debacle.  Apple was a big customer but when Intel was dropped fully the M series of arm chips was already displacing them. It was still a huge blow for sure but it was never the real reason Intel ended up struggling. It was a symptom of the real problem and not the cause.  The real problem wasn't entirely complacency either even if they sure were milking consumers. The biggest issue was a combination of factors - mostly the natural monopoly emerging with tsmc while at the same time a short sighted but genuine sunken cost fallacy prevented Intel from going EUV.   I mean genuine as in, Intel was so much ahead that when they needed it EUV wasn't ready so they spent a metric ton of money maxing out multi patterning for the right reasons. EUV wasn't ready and they had to do something else in the meantime.   When EUV finally was ready, tsmc started buying EUV while Intel had enough (and at the time still competitive) production capacity with multi patterning. They were basically still making the money back on those investments.   The problem was when multi patterning hit the wall EUV was still accelerating and they were a mile behind at that front. They should've realized that they had to bite the bullit on it earlier, but this is hard when it's so expensive and your products still seem to be doing well.   I think it took way too long and I still think Pat Gelsinger essentially made all the right decisions, but just painfully late (though maybe still not too late).   The simplified story MBA's like to spin that you're a genius if you go fab-less in my view is bullshit because intel-foundry is a must survive strategic asset and it wasn't doomed from the start (and still isn't).   The mindset that all that matters is margins and short term shareholder value is how the entire world ends up dependent on Taiwan. It's painfully undesirable but indeed slightly more profitable per unit for all companies involved.   That also becomes a self fulfilling prophecy though. ASML machines become progressively tuned and better yielding as you pump out volume.   A monopoly has the highest volume so will end up with the best tuned machines and the best yields.   Given that engineers are massively cheaper and work longer hours in Taiwan and that tsmc receives strong government support in Taiwan, combined with the volume advantages makes it hard for them not to win.   Spinning of Intel-design as fabless leaves Intel foundry with less volume and you can't survive or thrive as a foundry that way.   The Chinese understand this hence the ban on using foreign silicon in the future.   Normally it's a bad move to force your companies to use inferior products but foundries are weird. The product is inferior with low volume because you don't get to tune the machines enough. If you do guarantee high volume you do get to tune the machines and your product won't be so inferior anymore.   This weird dynamic (and the fact that you need to sell your early wafers while you're still tuning the machines to survive economically) is what makes foundry challenging and weird.",buildapc,2025-10-30 21:18:38,2,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99702734), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 217, 'end': 222}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99849176), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 251, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986473), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 397, 'end': 402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986028), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 752, 'end': 757}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48062205), 'word': 'EU', 'start': 769, 'end': 771}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985683), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 798, 'end': 803}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93337417), 'word': 'EUV', 'start': 847, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004388), 'word': 'EUV', 'start': 951, 'end': 954}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94061846), 'word': 'EUV', 'start': 1026, 'end': 1029}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8177331), 'word': 'EU', 'start': 1069, 'end': 1071}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9979311), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1079, 'end': 1084}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97676337), 'word': 'EUV', 'start': 1298, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.8933109), 'word': 'Pat Gelsinger', 'start': 1576, 'end': 1589}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9970145), 'word': 'Taiwan', 'start': 2032, 'end': 2038}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9786178), 'word': 'AS', 'start': 2195, 'end': 2197}]",Tópico 5

They took a small problem that very few people actually had and blew it up to make it sound as if everyone who bought Intel was not only stupid, but they also had issues with the 13-14th generation of processors. But remember, Reddit HATES Intel. This site led by the AMD fanboys over at r/pcmasterrace will say anything to make Intel look bad. These kids worship AMD and saying anything against AMD is almost sacrilege. I have had an I7-14700k with 0 issues for over a year now.  I've been building my own PCs since I was 19 years old. That was over 20 years ago. The first PC I bought and built myself was an AMD. (K6-3) And I was the biggest AMD fanboy you could find. You could get more bang for your buck. Intel at the time was vastly more expensive than AMD. So if you didn't have a ton of cash to blow on a new rig, AMD was a better choice. But then came the performance and driver issues that plagued AMD for years. Frequent blue screens, random crashes, coil whine and buggy video drivers. I remember having to find a 3rd party program to de-clock my video card because the sucker would overheat.  When I had some money I decided to splurge and get the Intel I7-920 and an Nvidia card, which was in 2008. Overnight all of my problems disappeared. No more blue screens and random crashes. No more buggy video drivers. I've since used all Asus, Intel and Nvidia parts and I've never had an issue with my PCs other than a failed network adapter on a MoBo that I bought open box. I don't care about the fact that AMD might have slightly better gaming performance. I'm not going to notice that 1% difference when running at max settings. All I want is my system to be stable and have no issues or errors and I've never had a stability issue on any Intel system that I have built since the I7-920.

While ofc there's fanboys for everything everywhere pretty much, I haven't seen what you've seen, not in this subreddit at least.  You had problems with AMD 17 years ago when AMD and Intel were *very* different companies than they are now. Very likely 99% of the staff isn't even the same. Certainly both AMD and Intel both have had execs come and go, the leadership of both has changed, the computing world has changed. Yet, you continue to write off AMD in 2025 despite that, which really surprises me. You say you were an AMD fanboy back then.. seems like maybe you've become an Intel fanboy instead. Better I think to not be a fanboy at all. I've owned both AMD and Intel, had good success with both. I've been on Intel since about 2010, but had the 7800X3D been out when I bought my 12700K in 2021, you can be sure I would have gone AMD again then, bc the X3D CPUs really *are* the best for gaming (and way more than 1% as you claim).. and bc gaming is my most-demanding use case. Likewise, when I upgrade in a year and a half, I'm certainly going to consider Intel, Nova Lake looks really interesting, but will it perform? I'll wait on independent benchmarks before deciding what I'll get. Logic, not fanboyism.   Idk, seems like AMD (Lisa Su) has the leadership to make good products, and has proven that by doing so. Intel on the other hand, thought it was a great idea to cancel the ""Royal Core"" project led by Jim Keller, thinking mediocre improvements like in the 2010s was the way to go, and has bungled every CPU line after Alder Lake (12th gen), so I've lost confidence in Intel's leadership, for now.   Do as you wish, it's your money, your choice, and maybe Intel will be the best to buy next-gen, but if I buy Intel next time, it'll be because it's the stable AND most-performant choice, and not bc I had a bad experience a human generation ago.",buildapc,2025-10-30 23:38:58,1,Negative,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91402674), 'word': 'Reddit', 'start': 0, 'end': 6}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9913703), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 266, 'end': 269}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9926825), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 288, 'end': 291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99884975), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 296, 'end': 301}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98958254), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 418, 'end': 421}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9988398), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 426, 'end': 431}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98938775), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 565, 'end': 568}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8429996), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 638, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99834824), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 695, 'end': 700}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9857061), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 775, 'end': 778}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99824536), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 783, 'end': 788}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9977186), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 831, 'end': 836}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9427451), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 951, 'end': 954}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99755704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1178, 'end': 1183}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9736526), 'word': 'Nova Lake', 'start': 1185, 'end': 1194}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98176503), 'word': 'I', 'start': 1333, 'end': 1334}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6205111), 'word': '##dk', 'start': 1334, 'end': 1336}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98759174), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1349, 'end': 1352}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.8890649), 'word': 'Lisa Su', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9987998), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1438, 'end': 1443}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78324777), 'word': 'Royal', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1511}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.50214636), 'word': 'Jim', 'start': 1533, 'end': 1536}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.51958823), 'word': 'Keller', 'start': 1537, 'end': 1543}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.38311833), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 1656, 'end': 1660}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952923), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1700, 'end': 1705}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9949314), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1787, 'end': 1792}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99582064), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1840, 'end': 1845}]",Tópico 1

Nvidia on the other hand was laying the ground work starting with 20 series and why they can STILL have some carryover support for new features and keep things going. Their whole line up has a single trajectory and don’t require different teams and feature sets because their products are scattered all over the place.

My 1080p monitor is the only bottleneck now 😅  **Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK?**   750W should technically be enough, check the GPU vendor specifications just to be safe.  **Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that.**   I’m using the MSI B650 Plus and it works perfectly fine. Unless you need advanced PCIe 5.0 support or beefier VRMs for heavy overclocking, B650(E) should be enough.  **For the 9070XT, I mostly see Sapphire and XFX at lower prices. Are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or ASRock, for example?**   I went with Sapphire—great cooling and no issues so far. If you're not into overclocking, Sapphire or XFX are solid picks. For more aggressive tuning, you might want to compare thermals and VRMs across brands.  **Do I need to buy thermal paste separately?**   I didn’t. My cooler came with pre-applied paste, and I run my CPU at 105W mode. If you’re planning to push beyond that, investing in a good thermal paste could help.  **Do I need a GPU bracket/support/holder?**   Yes—definitely recommended. The 9070XT is a heavy card, and a bracket helps prevent long-term sag or stress on the PCIe slot.  **Do I need anything else that won’t be provided with any of the components yet?**   If you’ve got a modular PSU, make sure you have all the necessary power cables. Also double-check for case screws, standoffs, and Wi-Fi antennas (if your mobo supports it).",pcmasterrace,2025-10-21 13:32:50,2,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9503969), 'word': 'MS', 'start': 557, 'end': 559}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5577263), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 740, 'end': 742}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7793154), 'word': '##pphire', 'start': 742, 'end': 748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67109156), 'word': 'X', 'start': 753, 'end': 754}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.41336167), 'word': 'Giga', 'start': 820, 'end': 824}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.44674876), 'word': 'AS', 'start': 832, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5205169), 'word': 'Sapphire', 'start': 869, 'end': 877}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45685434), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 947, 'end': 949}]",Tópico 1

Yeah, we know, moving it to a legacy branch doesn't means it's getting no support, but less support, which is ridiculous, hence deserving of backlash. They're still dropping support for the cards, just not entirely.  I've been saying this for years that AMD has worse driver support than NVIDIA. It's not just that they drop products faster and push older ones to legacy branches, they also have worse driver feature support, even when they're still on the main branch.  Every time AMD releases a new radeon software feature, it's always locked to the newest cards, or the second newest. RSR, SAM, AFMF, RIS 2, Anti-Lag+, etc  I remember when RSR came out and NVIDIA responded with NIS for feature parity, and it worked on every GPU they still updated. AMD then claimed Anti-Lag+ couldn’t run on older cards, only to prove themselves wrong by adding support through Anti-Lag 2 in games using those same GPUs.  The reason why is because in games, AMD needs as many compatible cards as possible to convince developers to integrate their features. On the driver side, there’s no such pressure, so they use feature restrictions as a way to push upgrades.  That’s why I switched to NVIDIA. They’re just better when it comes to long-term driver and driver feature support.

AMD,nmadmti,"7000 isn't that far off either since it also lacks  the support they need going forward. They just don't want to spend time/money on supporting prior gens that aren't cross compatible with their current/future AI focused generations.  Nvidia doesn't have that problem because they've been laying th groundwork for AI features since 2018 with their 20 series, it's why they can push some of their current DLSS4 features all the way back to 7+ year old arch. AMD can't even push any of their FSR4 feautres to 1 generation old cards (7000 series), they'd have to develop and maintain a different approach or new ""comparable"" features that wouldn't be moved forward to current or future cards, no business sense in continuing to support such products apparently. Same reason they are disabling the USB-C port, underused now, no longer used in current/future products and requires continuted support....best they can do is just ditch it.  Simply put, AMD missed the bus years ago and now they're trying to catch it. Some of us were saying that they need to get on baord pronto but people were too busy knocking down AI, DLSS, RT. Apparently AMD and their fanboys thought native res and raster was where it was at, all while Nvidia saw the challenges and limits on continuing to increase the raw power needed to keep up with the ever growing demands of software/games.",pcmasterrace,2025-10-31 00:16:10,7,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9849414), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 210, 'end': 212}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98710054), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 235, 'end': 241}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97420347), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 314, 'end': 316}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9111872), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 404, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99556214), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 457, 'end': 460}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.90973717), 'word': 'F', 'start': 490, 'end': 491}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99215007), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 794, 'end': 797}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95237374), 'word': 'C', 'start': 798, 'end': 799}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9912832), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 946, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.73135257), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 1111, 'end': 1113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5137446), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1115, 'end': 1117}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99397266), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1136, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9776972), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1219, 'end': 1225}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nm81xun,"BF6 already feels smoother! Before I was still getting 120 fps ( locked I don't want or need the extra frames, can't hit a consistent 130 anyway) but it didn't FEEL like I was getting anything more than 100.  Now it actually feels and looks like 120 fps with the added bonus of reduced to almost non-existent stuttering and micro-freezing. I think I gained a few extra frames as well but still can't hit a solid 130 so I'll stay locked to 120. Frame timings have definitely been improved!  Super happy with the update so far, will continue to monitor and update you all!  Edit 1: Ran a game of Conquest on Mirak Valley and two rounds of RedSec, I could INSTANTLY feel and see the improved frame timing and smoothness overall.

AMD,nm9i9yk,"This is what the AMD Stans can't seem to understand. As someone who's used both Radeon and GeForce stuff, I can tell you... NVIDIA even when they remove support, they just get it right from the beginning. With GeForce you get 99% of the performance day 1. Rather than waiting months for the full performance of my card, NVIDIA gives it basically right away.  The whole FineWine argument makes no sense to me, these cards have a limited shelf life, if the first 6 months you're getting gimped performance, how is that a good thing? These cards are only relevant for maybe 24 months and their support is maybe 6 years of support if you're lucky with AMD and more like 8 years with NVIDIA. If I have to wait 4-6 months to get the full performance of my card, then any money you saved buying AMD is basically mute imo. The extra $50-100 is worth getting the full performance day 1 rather than waiting months for it. Especially if the issue is making the device completely unusable.   Then take into account black screen issues, game issues, multi-monitor power usage and inconsistent driver updates where like you said AMD may not ship a driver every month. I just never understood the FineWine thing... Now I will be fair and say NVIDIA's drivers honestly haven't been the best with Blackwell, but they've been just bad relative to how they were with Ampere, Pascal, Turing etc. They're still a lot better than AMD's worst driver moments the past couple of years and they're no where near Intel's driver problems for GFX. So NVIDIA is still the better choice in terms of driver support and I will give AMD credit, they held back RDNA4 to work on drivers more and it helped them a lot.  Either way, I'm tired of this duopoly and the GPU industry in general, too many people not willing to call out the BS from any of these companies and all of them are just screwing consumers.

It didn't matter what you picked and tbh that's how they should have carried on, only make the new stuff the new generation naming.  In the 7000 series though they went back to the 5000 series naming sort of because they decided to mix old architectures again with the new stuff. For example, the 7735HS a Zen 3 chip and the 7745HX a Zen4 chip, that one third digit is supposed to notify you that you're buy Zen4, therefore it was as an indicator as to what Ryzen generation you were buying, but it just confused consumers even more because some people thought a 7640HS was worse than a 7735HS, but in single core the 7640HS beat the 7735HS and in multi-thread both were about even.

AMD,nlts0kp,"The problem's that the moment these come onto the market isn't the moment every single older laptop gets wiped off the market, especially considering these are practically the same chips being re-released time and time again by AMD. Here's an example:  One customer looks at 5 budget laptops and their processors. #1 has a Ryzen 5 7520U, #2 has a Ryzen 3 7440U, #3 has a Ryzen 5 220, #4 has an older, discounted Ryzen 5 5600U, #5 has a Ryzen 5 40. Place your bets on the best one now.  Where do you even begin to compare these? Well, the Ryzen 5 7520U has a higher number than the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 5600U, so it should be better, right? Wrong. Both the 7520U and 7440U are 4-cores, 8-threads, but the Ryzen 5 7520U has a 15W TDP, 4MB of L3 cache, is Zen 2-based (from 2019), and has a Radeon 610M iGPU. Meanwhile, the 7440U has a 28W TDP, 8MB of L3 cache, is Zen 4-based (3 years newer), and has a Radeon 740M iGPU. It's going to be an order of magnitude faster than the chip that's a higher number than it. As for the Ryzen 5 5600U? It's a 6-core, 12-thread Zen 3 chip with a 15W TDP, 16MB of L3 cache, with a much inferior Vega 7 iGPU.  Okay... so the Ryzen 7520U is a no-go, and the Ryzen 7440U and Ryzen 5600U are kind of up for debate if you have a dGPU in these laptops (though absolutely pick the 7440U if the iGPU is the only form of graphics onboard). Well what's up with the Ryzen 5 40? What generation does that fall under? If the third digit of the 7000 series was architecture, and the first digit of the 5000 series was architecture, is the Ryzen 5 40... Zen 4 based? Well no, you're not supposed to know that, you're supposed to just believe it's a new chip. Well we know it's a Zen 2 4-core 8-thread with 4MB of L3 cache from the article, but this potential customer doesn't. They'll find it out if they research it, but by this point they're probably getting sick of researching CPUs when the vast majority of people know barely anything more than an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 being good, and an RTX graphics also being good. They most likely don't know anything about cores, architectures, TDP, or L3 cache, and probably just want a working laptop.  What about the, uh, Ryzen 5 220? That seems... probably a fair bit worse than the Ryzen 3 7440U and Ryzen 5 5600U going off the name and potentially being connected in naming scheme to the Ryzen 5 40, so it's worse, right? Nope. The Ryzen 5 220 is a 6-core, 12-thread, Zen 4-based, 28W chip with 16MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 740M graphics. A clear choice to pick that gets the best of both worlds with regards to the cores & cache of the older chip, and the newer architecture and iGPU of the newer chip.  Outside of this hypothetical scenario now, I want to add an honourable mention to compare to the Ryzen 5 220. I'd like to bring up the Ryzen AI 5 330, which is a Zen 5-based 4-core 8-thread 28W chip with 8MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 820M graphics. It's got less cores and less L3 cache than the Ryzen 5 220 and most likely will be worse in benchmarks [(and as a matter of fact, it is)](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6616vs6917/AMD-Ryzen-5-220-vs-AMD-Ryzen-AI-5-330), but despite this is a tier above (X20 v. X30) the 220, and very few will catch that the newer chip is worse than the older one. Even chips within this new naming scheme are inconsistent.  When these chips come out, the laptop market isn't going to have done away with the older chips for no good reason. [These chips are still out there](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Notebook-Keyboard-Professional/dp/B0FT3CR5VK), and customers looking for an AMD chip are gonna regret looking for one if they have to compare this kind of shit. This naming scheme's only a year old with the Ryzen AI 300 series, and the previous one (where the architecture was defined by the third digit) lasted two generations from 2023 to 2024. Pre-2023 laptops are perfectly usable for the average person and they're still going to be selling those laptops today, and god help anyone looking for an AMD laptop that has to deal with this naming BS. Intel's not much better with their 200V series but at least it looks like they're going to stay the course and keep using that naming scheme now that desktop and mobile are somewhat unified. AMD's just drunkenly driving off a cliff with their mobile naming scheme and landing on another cliff they'll drive off on in a year or two. Meanwhile, their desktop chips are very easy to understand in comparison. No random digit amount switching, no sneaky third digit signifying architectures, or any of that nonsense. The Ryzen 5 9600 is faster than the Ryzen 5 7600.

AMD,nlxevge,"You can judge a CPU based on if it's a Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, or Ryzen 7, but that's not really a good idea beyond a generalization. A Ryzen 7 1800X is much worse than a Ryzen 5 7600. An Intel i7-870 is much worse than an Intel i3-12100.  Going past the obvious, a Ryzen 9 9900X is worse for gaming than a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and Ryzen 7 5700 is worse than a Ryzen 5 5600 (because the 5700 is a special chip - whereas usually chips like the 5600 are based off lower-clocked 5600Xs under the same architecture, the 5700 is based off the 5700G with PCIe 3.0 and much lower L3 cache. This continues with mobile hardware, from my comment above, with CPUs like the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 7520U. One is two architectures newer, with double the L3 cache, double the TDP, with higher clocks, and a better iGPU. You'd think it to be the Ryzen 5 of the same ""generation"" (7000U) but it's not.

Or better still, dedicate 2 ram slots to the CPU, and the other 2 ram slots (which are usually empty and useless since you lose performance running 4 sticks in most scenarios nowadays) are dedicated to the GPU as MOAR V-RAM.  That would actually be epic and massively increase the adaptability and versatility of each individual GPU, which would also increase competition too (meaning cheaper GPU's that are also significantly better).",AMD,2025-10-30 03:04:58,0,Positive,Neutral,[],Tópico 1

AMD,nm5j350,"How have I not hears of LPCAMM until now!?  Yeah, in an ideal world you would have M-board that has 3 separate chip sockets, one for your CPU, one for your unified RAM, and one for your GPU chip. It would probably look something like 3 CPU sockets.  Which would also make cooling very easy and scalable, something our current M-board layout didn't account for. They did account for development add-on cards however so it was a necessary step and an integral part of computer design history. However now that we've optimised general use computers to CPU, GPU, and RAM (ignoring storage, keeping that scalable with addon slots is definitely the way) I do definitely feel that new layout standard is due.  Of course that's an ideal world where CPU, GPU, and RAM manufacturers all agree on the same socket, we'd probably need some kind of modular M-board that allows the use of whatever Intel, Nvidia, AMD, etc.... GPU, CPU, and RAM sockets each company invents, otherwise you'd get stuck in a closed ecosystem where you're at the whim of the manufacturer of wether you're allowed to have more RAM or a more powerful GPU or a more efficient CPU or not.  Though it's nice to dream of a more optimal computer layout (of course my personal take is to have the CPU and GPU on opposite sides of the M-board, that way they each get their own separate airflow, and also the backside of each socket/slot can get some extra passive cooling which would help with the higher and higher clock speeds our chips are now reaching).  It is the worst of both worlds, however it is highly scalable and if the GPU had it's own dedicated memory controller then it could work as an alternative where you have double the memory, but each chip only sees half of that memory. I imagine in high-demand dynamic workloads where the CPU wants more RAM one second, then the GPU wants more ram the next, that having separated RAM for each chip could become a benefit and act as a safety margin. Though I do agree that it's probably not the best idea and would require just as much of a redesign as unified RAM would.  Unless you just put RAM stick slots on the GPU (probably a really good use case for LPCAMM as that would allow you to maintain the same backplate clearance standard current GPU's are built to) then independent scalable RAM would just be a direct upgrade to our current layout as-is.  Though I definitely want discrete chips on an M-board with unified memory (and probably some extra silicone chip, hell you could probably split the traditional rasterisation GPU chip and the RT/AI/Tensor/etc... chip into separate sockets) cause that would mean having 3-4 AIO's on your board with nothing else and that would just look too cool imho.",AMD,2025-10-30 07:29:00,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6861295), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 24, 'end': 26}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99821895), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 883, 'end': 888}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9428539), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 890, 'end': 896}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9692312), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 898, 'end': 901}]",Tópico 1

You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

AMD,n0ap7lk,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

AMD,n046z2m,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Intel,2025-06-27 19:06:33,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82722825), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 146, 'end': 148}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.58519953), 'word': 'Mac', 'start': 253, 'end': 256}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96073776), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 338, 'end': 340}]",Tópico 1

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked.

The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period.
