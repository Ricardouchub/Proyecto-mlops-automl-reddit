Intel,ntcj3az,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**.

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3.

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power.

Intel,nnhqy1t,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",hardware,2025-10-10 19:19:56,-3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5901546), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 478, 'end': 480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9591582), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 657, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5589075), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 840, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8458032), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 861, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.894982), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 872, 'end': 874}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83673716), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 897, 'end': 899}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9113383), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 960, 'end': 967}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9057014), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1045, 'end': 1051}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8788988), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1331, 'end': 1337}]",Tópico 5

Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel?

Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",hardware,2025-10-09 20:55:03,-1,Negative,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982318), 'word': 'BMG', 'start': 22, 'end': 25}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93915), 'word': 'PT', 'start': 71, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99868506), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 205, 'end': 210}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.903507), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 257, 'end': 260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986084), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 493, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.63241297), 'word': 'B', 'start': 641, 'end': 642}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985177), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9988906), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 850, 'end': 855}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9460265), 'word': 'Op', 'start': 1150, 'end': 1152}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985813), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1341, 'end': 1346}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.53755426), 'word': 'Op', 'start': 1364, 'end': 1366}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93981016), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1382, 'end': 1384}]",Tópico 5

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Hell, at 1080p my 8gb card was over capacity on battlefield 6. There's an argument to be made that it isn't enough for future 1080p gaming as well.  Can you do plenty of gaming on an 8gb card? Yes. Can you run every game at max settings? No, not even on 1080p. You'll have to turn settings down.

Intel,nwn5ndl,"So recently I bought a new prebuilt that came with a 5060 TI 8GB. For my old system, shortly before, I'd purchased a 9060 XT 16GB.  I haven't had an AMD card in many a year, and I was inclined to be generous to NVIDIA, thinking ""Hey, they've got DLSS, they've got multi-frame gen, yadda yadda yadda...""  So I'd been playing Borderlands 4 on my old rig with the 9060 XT when the 5060 TI system came in a few days ago. I tried playing Borderlands 4 on the new PC with DDR5 RAM and a much better processor, and for every game I tried (Witchfire, Borderlands 4), it was a much worse experience.  DLSS frame gen treated me well on my old 4060 so I thought  multi-frame gen would be rad and close the 8GB-16GB gap, but holy shit the lag was like improperly configured Lossless Scaling. It was awful, and I am NOT generally sensitive to latency. I really learned that without enough native frames to feed frame gen, it's not even a feature worth using.  I suspect had my new PC had the 16gb version of the 5060 TI it probably would have run everything as well as, if not better than, the 9060 XT.  As an example, on my new PC with the 5060 TI, Borderlands 4 was running like less than between 35-50 fps native on medium settings. With the same processor, same RAM, but a 9060 XT 16GB, it runs natively in the 70s and 80s on high settings.  Now, I do only game at 1080p, mind you, so that factors in as well, I suppose.  I was a true believer that 8GB was still enough in late 2025, especially with AI assistance, until this past weekend. I would urge you to go with more VRAM.

Intel,nwbcqeu,"Without checking, it could be thermals, stability or even power issues. I would start with HWinfo and check to see if anything it running beyond the thermal limits. You can google what the running temps should be for GPU, CPU and motherboard chips. HWinfo will also give you a look at how much power is being used. Some adding up may give you an indication if it is power spikes causing shut downs.  If it is not down to overheating then check stability. I always check memory first, then CPU and finally the GPU. I use Kharhu for memory. This is not a free app, but you can use HCImemtest which is comparable. I have yet to see anyone use memtest in any version that gives credible results. It may have improved in recent years, but I tend to avoid it from its history.  CPU testing just run cinebench on a loop for 10 minutes. That will tell you if you have heat or stability issues.  GPU tends to be games as they tend to utilise the most assets in the GPU. If the CPU and memory come back clear, then running different games may narrow it down.  When stability testing though, there is no 100% guarantee on the results. Because you are allocating resources to run the programme, then it is impossible to test 100% of any device.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware?

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551167), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4739347), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221626), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936435), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7001683), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9795221), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800244), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.66826093), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658418), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568377), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9011492), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040777), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75001216), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83806634), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164697), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8814712), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97932374), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90052766), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748384), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866346), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113533), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401754), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70765054), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8874185), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076941), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363593), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 5

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67433), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718553), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9804187), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.789196), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56807995), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224169), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943218), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6215225), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8683438), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277298), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.74155277), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8893399), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7274337), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.985618), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676907), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811373), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200319), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515256), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5171995), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736856), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 3

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards).

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.

Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.78064805), 'word': 'N', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49205962), 'word': '##vid', 'start': 290, 'end': 293}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.59018373), 'word': 'T', 'start': 312, 'end': 313}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8755106), 'word': 'Polarix', 'start': 348, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96025205), 'word': 'R', 'start': 361, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.754549), 'word': 'PSP', 'start': 567, 'end': 570}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.49702105), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 631, 'end': 633}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48533577), 'word': '##on VII', 'start': 635, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.808714), 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 652, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85674125), 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 900, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7854365), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66929007), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8934811), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1491, 'end': 1494}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96433926), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1627, 'end': 1630}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.80651206), 'word': 'George', 'start': 1813, 'end': 1819}]",Tópico 4

It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic.

And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility).

They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,nnz3axo,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.

Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one.

I do have 8x MI50 hooked up to a LGA2066 board with two PLX8749 switches, running x8 to each.

AMD,nvftzjh,"They don't hate them, AMD GPUs simply SUCKS for what Laptop requires most  \#1 Reason: EFFICIENCY, Nvidia destroys AMD gpus in terms of efficiency, not even close, and efficiency is everything in laptop, even 10W higher could become a problem. Nvidia just draws so much less power at the same performance level for many generations already ever since the first RTX. The 5700XT draws the same power as 2080ti while being way slower and has no feature, 7900XTX consume more power than 4090 while being destroyed in everything, even newest 9070XT consumes about 100W higher than 5070Ti even though it's still slightly worse, this might not be relevant in PC at all, but for Laptop this is super crucial, and AMD completely failed at this. Not to mention idle power draw is a problem for AMD gpu.     \#2: Laptops are always meant for WORK and PRODUCTIVITY, not just gaming. If you want gaming only just build pc or get a console, but laptops have to be able to do as many productivity tasks as possible, that's what laptop is made for, a portable pc for work, even gaming laptop is made so that people can work and game on them, and AMD failed this aspect as well, Nvidia not only offer far better feature sets, but also simply work way better and compatible with everything, never need to workaround or tinkering, everything works with Nvidia gpu, and this is massive for laptop     These are the 2 biggest reasons, it's never about stocks or lack of volume that some clueless comments here suggest. That's why AMD thrives with Console instead, because consoles don't need neither of the reasons I mention above, console doesn't care about efficiency since they always plugged in, and console is for gaming only, never for anything else, so AMD has no problem fulfilling the massive volume of console Gpus, because for console use case AMD gpus make sense, unlike laptop",hardware,2025-12-22 21:42:38,1,Negative,Anger,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81541055), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 53, 'end': 59}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8387707), 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 99, 'end': 103}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81221503), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 244, 'end': 250}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82069004), 'word': 'R', 'start': 361, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9281061), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 671, 'end': 677}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9365858), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 705, 'end': 708}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8037381), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 784, 'end': 787}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71043634), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1130, 'end': 1133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8613513), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1162, 'end': 1168}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6720902), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1334, 'end': 1335}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9187207), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1509, 'end': 1512}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7436074), 'word': 'Con', 'start': 1526, 'end': 1529}]",Tópico 1

I do remember some talk about how the specific model also might affect things due to... something, rather than just pure refresh/res combo. thought that was mainly for 3(+) panels where it mattered, but maybe that could be what's happening even with just 2 panels.",hardware,2025-12-22 19:15:41,0,Neutral,Neutral,[],Tópico 4

They still make and sell 6000 series cards.  Then there's the fact that partial FSR4 support is possible on older cards, but not released or enabled by AMD.  I don't really care about the upscaling part of it, the 6800 chewed up any game i threw at it at 1440p without RT. I wanted it because TAA or FSR3 are horrid when it comes to image quality when you use them as AA solutions.   Playing something like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a travesty if using TAA or FSR 3. Such a beautiful game that looks like a smudged mess with those solutions.  So i got an Nvidia 5080 for black friday sales. I basically just don't trust AMD's GPU division to not abandon even their 9000 series once they release a new series. And i'm done giving money to a  company division that is content in merely keeping their cards in ""Nvidia -50$"" price range for much lower feature sets.  I HATE AND LOATHE Nvidia as a corporation and hate that i gave them money, but i ultimately just picked the better product for my needs.

The roadmap has more effect, and TSMC, Samsung, or Intel being in the picture is rarely used to drive prices lower.   Sure competition among fabs and packagers may set the ballpark of costs. But designers rarely use the threat of going with a different process to get a lower/better price from TSMC, Samsung, etc.   If AMD is going w Samsung it is likely because Samsung's roadmap may align w AMD requirements for a specific design.   The reason why this news may be unlikely is that AMD does not have an stablished silicon team with Samsung (that I am aware of). And that usually is how you can tell any type of significant volume from a large design team is going to be on a given foundry.   However Samsung does have a very nice roadmap for the type of large dies AMD has in their pipeline for their monolithic SoCs (mainly their APUs and GPUs). So there could be some alignment there.

AMD,nuk1fn8,"> It definitely feels like an ego thing that they didn't just copy Ryzen's super successful and ultimately quite straightforward chiplet scaling strategy.  Well, I think Intel at least *tried* to copy AMD's chiplet-paradigm helplessly for the last couple of years …  It seems that Intel was taken totally by surprise on anything Chiplets and got caught with their pants down (again), when AMD brought it this quick to market, when having worked on them for a decade plus.  Though IF Intel would already worked on anything *disintegrated silicon* for said 10 years by then (like Intel claimed when announcing their heterogenous '*Mix and Match*'-approach around 2018), *Intel would* ***not*** *have needed +6 years for finally reaching a fairly comparable design-approach* only half a decade later in 2023 with Meteor&nbsp;Lake (also Arrow Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Ponte Vecchio).  Since sure enough, all these disintegrated designs \*somehow\* brought Intel truly massive troubles engineering-wise and they had tremendous difficulties to overcome those for years — The years-long horror-stories over validation and dead-on silicon past tape-outs on *Sapphire Rapids* and *Ponte Vecchio* for example are testament to that … *Meteor Lake* was also everything but a performer.  ---- The issue at hand for Intel was quite many-layered …  * Intel hardly knew how to do it (despite claiming otherwise for years). *Shocker!*  * Intel had no real equivalent to AMD's SuperGlue aka *Infinity&nbsp;Fabric*™   That's for sure the most striking one, obviously — The reason they had to wait for PCi-E 5.0 to become a thing, for ""Intel's"" *CXL* to finalize upon it (which in itself is basically just AMD's former *CCIX* in disguise as Copy-pasta anyway done out of spite).  * Intel haven't remotely had adopted a design-strategy by then, which would've offered so to speak ""intelligent"" chiplets/tiles, which could be freely thrown together randomly at will on a (PCi-E) bus (which AMD actually evidently can with their CCX and I/O-dies since ages).  So Intel's claims before the press in 2018, of already working on disintegrated silicon since years already (and that AMD *weren't* actually as spearheading as they became), was pure virtue-signaling, a blatant lie.  As a result, Intel's IP-blocks still remained virtually *dumb* (in the sense of *head*|*less*) for years on out afterwards and most of it had to be *re-engineered from scratch* in all this other trouble like lay-offs, down-sizing or Intel's road-maps being constantly thrown out again (only to start over once more).  The reason why AMD had a years-long edge on chiplets from the onset, was since Intel just couldn't place or handle the stuff as ***independent*** *IP-blocks* — Everything was grown intercoupled and -linked together.  AMD on the other hand already had a decade-long headstart, due to their already well-tuned modular concept of IP-blocks (building-block principle with IP-blocks to freely chose from) attuned for the console-era from back then for the console-contracts (those, Intel always made fun of since).  So Intel allegedly been working on chiplet-esque designs for years already, was utter bullsh!t, and that's actually the sole reason WHY Intel struggled so hard for years with anything Tiles — They started at 0.",hardware,2025-12-17 18:49:09,1,Neutral,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.99109393), 'word': 'R', 'start': 67, 'end': 68}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.32849276), 'word': '##zen', 'start': 69, 'end': 72}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986168), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 170, 'end': 175}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99442935), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 201, 'end': 204}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99776673), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 281, 'end': 286}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.43427613), 'word': 'Chip', 'start': 329, 'end': 333}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961066), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 389, 'end': 392}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9487529), 'word': 'IF Intel', 'start': 480, 'end': 488}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99805945), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 578, 'end': 583}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9973374), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 669, 'end': 674}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8920873), 'word': 'Meteor &', 'start': 810, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6621619), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 822, 'end': 826}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.83863854), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 833, 'end': 843}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.93017673), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 845, 'end': 847}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9556483), 'word': '##pphire Rapids', 'start': 847, 'end': 860}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.9387083), 'word': 'Ponte Vecchio', 'start': 862, 'end': 875}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9979424), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 950, 'end': 955}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.7426384), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 1148, 'end': 1150}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.8074026), 'word': '##pphire Rapids', 'start': 1150, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7674334), 'word': 'Pont', 'start': 1170, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.78894573), 'word': '##e Vecchi', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1182}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6195514), 'word': '##o', 'start': 1182, 'end': 1183}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8411248), 'word': 'Met', 'start': 1222, 'end': 1225}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4919284), 'word': '##eor', 'start': 1225, 'end': 1228}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6543499), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 1229, 'end': 1233}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980032), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1305}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1334, 'end': 1339}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9976815), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1419, 'end': 1424}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9887272), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1451, 'end': 1454}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.64404446), 'word': '##G', 'start': 1462, 'end': 1463}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67761683), 'word': 'Infinity', 'start': 1472, 'end': 1480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98793507), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1614, 'end': 1619}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9870587), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1760, 'end': 1765}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45422596), 'word': 'O', 'start': 2014, 'end': 2015}]",Tópico 3

Three years in advance, you are kicking the tires on the PDK and making sure the node will achieve your goals for your design.  That is not so expensive you cannot do it for multiple foundries.  The next step, is finalizing the layout for masks, which culminates in the tape-out.  You could do that for multiple processes, but it does not make much sense, as you should have known which process you prefer before that step.  Masks are very expensive so you don't want to make them for two different processes.  So tape out is the last chance you have to make a foundry decision, but you should make it months before that.  As an example, AMD announced back in April that Venice chiplets taped out on TSMC 2nm.  Venice is going to be included in Helios racks that are being delivered in Q3 next year.  So maybe a little less than 1.5 years from tapeout to product.  Add in the time for doing the physical layout, and you get pretty close to 2 years.

I had the 12600K paired with my 4070 Ti, and upgraded to a 9800X3D, seeing this kind of improvement, but note also I was on a DDR4 build so part of that was undoubtedly the RAM moving up a generation. But in tests, [the 9800X3D stomps the average FPS and 1% lows of the 12th gen Intel chips](https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/rip-intel-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-285k-14900k-more#9800x3d-gaming-benchmarks) often by 50% or more.  In my personal experience and having had it for just under a year now, it just feels more ""stable"". On my 12600K I'd play games that would sometimes have inexplicable micro-stutters in the frame rate which I later learned were those 1% lows I'd read about. The AMD chip smoothed those out and now the games feel markedly more consistent.  Do note though that if you do productivity, e.g. video editing, 3D modeling, etc., the 9800X3D isn't optimal for them. It's no slouch, and I still do that as a hobby myself, but if your daily pay relies on lots of threads then something like the Intel Core Ultra 9 or the 9950X3D is a better choice. But for gaming, the 9800X3D really is the sweet spot for price and performance.  Also, it can be cooled with air alone. I have a Peerless Assassin 120 on mine and it has no trouble at all.

This will make this stuff in your system capable of actually using Gen 4 PCIe which is much faster than the Gen 3 it's really the only big step that's been useful recently.

AMD,nwforp0,"> ROG  I can't wait for them to cost more than the CPUs going into them./s  Seriously though, I feel the chipset offerings for higher-end systems is lacklustre, especially considering the insane prices some of these boards go for.  X870 is just a B650E in fancier terms and X870E is basically X670E but with USB 4. I feel X870E in particular is bad as it takes up 4 PCIe lanes and provides less options to the user (you could always add USB 4 through a PCIe expansion card and basically have an X870E, if needed).  X870 may also be seen as a downgrade on X670 as it offers less M.2 slots due to having only one BIOS chip instead of two, like X670, X670E and X870E. Some X670 boards also received unofficial PCIe 5.0 support on the main x16 slot, which brings it on par with X670E.  I feel AMD should've changed the chipset uplink to PCIe 5.0 x4 instead of PCIe 4.0 x4 for X870 and X870E, as this would bring the bandwidth between the chipset and the CPU to parity with Intel's Z890 (runs at PCIe 4.0 x8). This would also enable the use of an extra PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD without leaving too much performance on the table as it will no longer be bottlenecked by PCIe 4.0 between the chipset and the CPU.",AMD,2025-12-28 21:48:20,20,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70065546), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 308, 'end': 311}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56234276), 'word': 'X', 'start': 322, 'end': 323}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8925276), 'word': 'USB', 'start': 437, 'end': 440}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8844867), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 789, 'end': 792}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9968298), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 969, 'end': 974}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.942119), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 977, 'end': 978}]",Tópico 1

Yes, hardware acceleration was the *first* thing that I turned off. Wasn't the refresh rate, since both of my monitors at the time were the exact same model, DDU didn't fix it, and I'd had the issue on 2 different builds over the span of like 5 years.  So I plugged secondary display into the motherboard to use the iGPU on my 7800X3D and haven't had the stuttering issue ever since. The thought process was like: ""well, if it's a resource/utilization thing, what if they both used a different GPU?. I only run games on my primary monitor, and I only use my secondary display for my browser, watching videos, Spotify, Discord, etc., so they don't *need* to be running off the same GPU. It's worth a try.""

Not as much as i used to, i play a few games a day now as opposed to like 5-6 fron S1 to S9, so roughly half the playtime, but i have easily over 10k hrs in this game, likely closer to 15k. And i play ranked only, so since im not a casual i cant just ditch the game like that. Over the 5 yrs i played many other competitive games, i played cs go, fortnite, wow, rocket league, but none of em could scratch the itch. After coming back to league, i realized what i was missing. I was missing league. Theres just no other game out there that feels this good to play. Especially since im very good at it (I was Master in S8 which is like GM now due to inflation and cuz GM didnt exist back then). Turns out, being REALLY good at a game makes it 10x more fun when u're playing it competitively, who would have thought! Ofc, im not gonna be a pro player or anything like that, but it doesnt mean i cant feel satisfaction from my 3 ranked games a day and feel the pleasure of improving and watching my rank grow. None of the other games i played felt anywhere near as good. In cs go i got master guardian but thats kinda mid. In rocket league i saw the dudes flying and i was like, nah no way i can learn that without another 10k hours investment, same for dota. Fortnite no build was cool, i employed the hide in a cellar afk strategy and was able to reach Unreal, the highest rank, averaging 0.11 kills per game. I quit cuz it was boring and after watching pros like Prospering i realized this guy can do 40 kill games, aint no way i will ever be as good as him at this game. Wow was cool and i nearly got the 0.1% title in m+, fell barely short, was doin 14s and 15s as a tank. However, these 3 months were miserable, everything was a chore, its like u gotta wash the dishes and clean the toilet in a video game, dailies weeklies rep farm, alt chars grinding, raids and vault slots to rng the bis trinkets etc. And in the end it didnt even feel that good, honestly wow is such a slow paced game its kinda boring.

AMD,nvj61bm,"I think league is not different than the other games like Marvel Rivals. U feel amazing when u win (dopamine rush), and u feel terrible when u lose. Altho, in league it feels extra miserable. Like in cs or rivals, u can be 1v3 and u might just clutch it, even with a deagle u can get some good headshots and win the round. But in league, if ur teammates were feeding, well now that 1v3 is the enemies also having 2 items on top of u, meaning they are like a tank and u're like a kitten to them, making it impossible to win. So u lose and ur whole game experience is getting trashed around because someone else fed the enemies. Even when i came back to league and i initially didnt care about my rank cuz i was just relearning the game after 5 yrs of not playing, it felt sooo miserable to lose. I didnt care about my LP at all cuz i knew i was rusty as fuck, and it still felt so bad to lose cuz the entire experience that u spend there feels like u're locked in like a hostage or smth. And yeah i main jungle and get told to kill myself and flamed every game (with creative ways like talon E off a building cuz the chat punishments are unreal in 2025), but ive grown such thick skin over the years that it doesnt bother me at all anymore, but yeah definitely the most toxic of all the mainstream games, except maybe for dbd, tho in the last few yrs bhvr introduced anti camping and anti tunneling mechanics so its not that bad. But yeah asides from that league is really not as bad as people make it seem to be, my only big complaint is that people dont surrender early enough. Im in diamond so unlike low elo they do surrender a lot, but still not quite as much as they should, but i also mainly play late game scaling champs so it doesnt bother me as much cuz my teammates wanna keep me hostage by not surrendering (cuz they still think we can win, somehow) then good for me cuz if any1s gonna carry its gonna be me on my monster scaling champ, tho realistically once ure far behind its prob like 10% chance to win, not worth dragging a 20 min game out for another 10 mins to slowly suffocate to death. Enemies in diamond are good at ending games but not amazing like master+ are, so they generally manage to end but it takes a bit more time which makes it more frustrating cuz like they have a 12k gold lead, mess around a lil bit, give u 4k gold back but they still have 8k lead and and 3 drakes so they end anyway with baron/soul at like 30 mins. Basically the enemies throw just enough to give 2 of ur 4 teammates enough hope to press No in the surrender vote, but not enough to actually come back (usually). But yeah i wouldnt say league is a bad game, it teaches u patience and perseverence ESPECIALLY if u main jungle cuz every1 always blames u all the time. U learn quickly whose opinion and words to ignore and how to read people's emotional wellbeing. The jungler is the leader of the team and he's the one who makes the calls on the map, like calling ur support to roam to voidgrubs, telling ur mid laner to push and recall 30 secs before the spawn timer so he can arrive full hp to the fight and so on. If u play mechanically easy champs (so not leesin or nidalee) u can carry pretty much exclusively by using ur brain even if u dont have great hands (aka mechanics), u cant really do that in most other games, like i was great with nades and setups in cs go but my aim sucks so much i always lose a 1v1 fight even in gold, honestly amazing i got to master guardian like that.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability.

AMD,ngmx0bu,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.

I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.

When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed. Despite extensive testing, the issue remains unresolved and continues to occur consistently now.  Specs:  Operating System: Windows 11 Pro 25H2 (Build 26200.7462)  CPU: Intel Core i7-13700KF (stock settings)  GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 8GB (stock)  Motherboard: MSI PRO Z690-A WIFI (MS-7D25), BIOS v5.32  RAM: 32GB (2×16GB) DDR5-5600 (G.Skill)  Storage: WD Blue SN570 1TB NVMe SSD  Cooling: NZXT Kraken 240mm AIO liquid CPU cooler  PSU: 750W 80+ Gold (PowerSpec OEM, included with prebuilt)  Display: Dual monitor setup, tested individually  I gave a call to Intel and now waiting for a call back.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.59896004), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166495), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933384), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176112), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867068), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694116), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6542172), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523955), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51501906), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546406), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089731), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235843), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 5

AMD,nt12wk5,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

AMD,ntz1is6,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Intel,2025-12-14 13:04:59,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985821), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 589, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9987382), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 638, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9978817), 'word': 'Final Fantasy XI', 'start': 807, 'end': 823}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.
