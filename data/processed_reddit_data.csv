The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",hardware,2026-01-11 16:53:47,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99530303), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 10, 'end': 13}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7197183), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 33, 'end': 36}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986958), 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 90, 'end': 94}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5870025), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 120, 'end': 122}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9838643), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 171, 'end': 174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.886636), 'word': 'St', 'start': 416, 'end': 418}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8116927), 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 422, 'end': 426}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70450944), 'word': 'SON', 'start': 431, 'end': 434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7414603), 'word': 'SONY', 'start': 518, 'end': 522}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980957), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 527, 'end': 536}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6963909), 'word': 'SONY', 'start': 827, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980106), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 835, 'end': 844}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9067299), 'word': 'PS', 'start': 1038, 'end': 1040}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7624722), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1158, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7628503), 'word': 'Desktop', 'start': 1347, 'end': 1354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.75722647), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 1359, 'end': 1365}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87763417), 'word': 'St', 'start': 1443, 'end': 1445}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8686893), 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 1449, 'end': 1453}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5764848), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1483}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9519312), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1641, 'end': 1646}]",Tópico 3

Intel,ny0j8e4,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.

Intel,nxycvko,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",hardware,2026-01-06 04:46:15,80,Neutral,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9844598), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 0, 'end': 3}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9919697), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 190, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99390405), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 225, 'end': 230}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9917518), 'word': 'Intel Arc', 'start': 342, 'end': 351}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99836713), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 421, 'end': 426}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95931274), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 463, 'end': 466}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6094787), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 555, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.53226596), 'word': 'St', 'start': 616, 'end': 618}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8117601), 'word': 'Hal', 'start': 622, 'end': 625}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94069374), 'word': 'X', 'start': 711, 'end': 712}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62377757), 'word': '##SS', 'start': 713, 'end': 715}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9834733), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 807, 'end': 810}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.48080903), 'word': 'F', 'start': 885, 'end': 886}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.72648776), 'word': 'R', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93468), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 951, 'end': 954}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.722687), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1000, 'end': 1002}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87178564), 'word': 'Switch', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76294184), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1061, 'end': 1062}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.51886696), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1128, 'end': 1130}]",Tópico 3

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:41:27,-2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8437369), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 52, 'end': 61}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8637726), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 63, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.777726), 'word': 'Met', 'start': 101, 'end': 104}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60526794), 'word': '##eor', 'start': 104, 'end': 107}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.89358836), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 108, 'end': 112}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.76103985), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 114, 'end': 124}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.7814685), 'word': 'Luna', 'start': 130, 'end': 134}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5881488), 'word': '##r', 'start': 134, 'end': 135}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.969792), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 136, 'end': 140}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.86424387), 'word': 'Cine', 'start': 216, 'end': 220}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7164214), 'word': '##ben', 'start': 220, 'end': 223}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7820184), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 462, 'end': 466}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9941365), 'word': 'IPC', 'start': 558, 'end': 561}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8300363), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 760, 'end': 769}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98455614), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 777, 'end': 785}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9908302), 'word': 'IPC', 'start': 820, 'end': 823}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9818982), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 894, 'end': 903}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9830823), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 962, 'end': 970}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.8178022), 'word': 'Cine', 'start': 1281, 'end': 1285}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5331531), 'word': '##ben', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1288}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6922188), 'word': '##ch', 'start': 1288, 'end': 1290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8266062), 'word': 'Cinebench', 'start': 1378, 'end': 1387}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97780275), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1446, 'end': 1454}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8220637), 'word': 'Elite', 'start': 1459, 'end': 1464}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9303267), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 1573, 'end': 1580}]",Tópico 3

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.

Went from Chinese 650w to a Corsair 850w.  And new cpu cooler, master cooler halo or something. (Air cooled) kept my old case.  I got my ram, mobo and gpu all from facebook marketplace. All brand new unopened, but it took me a while to gather all the parts. I was not trying to spend full price on anything.  Right now I play 4k max settings and get 250-300 fps with frame gen on.

Since we're talking about the server side now, Haswell-EP went from 18 cores maximum to 22 core Broadwell-EP to 28 cores on Skylake-SP. Cascade Lake-AP (rare bespoke sku) went up to 56 cores per socket.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing.

But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Intel,nymut0x,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Intel,o2dekrv,"I need help! My rig was having issues mounting drives, and crashing, and hang ups, so I figured my 13900k was finally dying (as expected from Intel). So I bought a 14900k and that wouldn't boot even with the latest bios. I had an Auros Z790 elite AX motherboard with 96gb Corsair vengeance 5200mhz DDR5 ram, and RTX 4090. So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now. When I press shut down, my screens turn off and it seems like it's off, but my fans and light and everything else are still running. So I have to hold the power button to shut it down.   I am suspicious of my PSU because I think it could cause some of these issues, but I've had this PSU only since 2023 and it's a Corsair HX1000i.   The only things I kept from my old build were the PSU, GPU, and ram. And considering both systems were having issues, it makes sense that maybe one of them is acting up. But I don't really know if that explains all the problems I've been having.   I've updated the Bios, I've reinstalled windows, I've tweaked power plans and bios settings, reseated hardware, and I feel like I'm just on a wild goose chase.

Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets.

I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.

As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.

Intel,o16r403,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware?

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,23,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9604742), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393346), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7001686), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 3

We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services.

Intel,lukywwo,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles.

It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682612), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658414), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568305), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114903), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8751363), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80407614), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83806515), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147056), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005272), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6974834), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5886638), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113516), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741815), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076934), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363589), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,68,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98579425), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.68072945), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5333894), 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82888675), 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8976545), 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8723915), 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87449723), 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52110404), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.63087773), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9507805), 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5053189), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83378524), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6943724), 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5678203), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6214106), 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6280624), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 5

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6743293), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.77185565), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041886), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891967), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808144), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224165), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943218), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152326), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277302), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415535), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8893401), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.985618), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676908), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811378), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72003263), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515258), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5171998), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5073669), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 5

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

AMD,o297kvo,"Zen 5 isnt a stagnation per se, nor is the Core stagnant itself.   If it truly were Intels Sky/Kabylake era... A Ryzen 5 wouldnt have been around 10-20% faster in MT/ST every fucking Gen except Zen 5 since that was only a major core and arch overhaul that should have been delayed a year for the overhauled IO Die that comes with Zen 6. Would even say it makes sense its a stagnation in performance in gaming and workloads that DONT use AVX512 instructions.   Stuff that uses AVX512 instructions is a major uplift Zen 4 vs 5 since they broadened the pipelines, as well as doing a true AVX512 implementation.    You could also say, why didnt they use Zen 4/5 Dense instead of the normal Zen Core structure, since it iant missing anything the Big Zen has...  I can tell you, because the performance uplift came from a combination of frequency and architecture itself.  Zen Dense clocks alot lower in some cases, which sure, gives you more cores, but in turn ruins the gains the Arch ITSELF has to offer, which scales with frequency to a certain point.   Then there is also the issue with Zen 5 lacking internal bandwidth and external (DDR5) in 1:1 mode. Which shows up, since a 9950X3D despite lower max boost clock, is faster than the non 3D. Same will be with the 9950X3D2, will be faster, since both CCDs will have access to a big chunk of extremely fast and low latency brick of storage.  Zen 6 will definitely be a massive change, since it comes with a 12 Core CCX, the reworked IO die for alot higher memory speed aka more bandwidth from the get go and a refreshed Arch which takes the groundwork of Zen 5 and iterates on it.   Zen 5 is a stopgap and rework of the old Zen 2/3 Arch.  Its basically what Zen/Zen+ to Zen 2 was. A major groundwork rework, but nothing spectacular for performance.   Imo, calling AMD stagnant like Kaby Lake-Skylake Era is not fair. Especially looking at all the facts, Kaby Lake to Skylake you were lucky to get single digit improvements evey Gen.

AMD,o10xa2g,"Summary:  “While the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was faster overall, the Framework Desktop was consuming more power than the Dell Pro Max GB10. On average the Framework Desktop over this entire span of CPU benchmarks saw an average wall power reading of 133 Watts with a recorded peak of 227 Watts. The Dell Pro Max GB10 meanwhile had a 103 Watt average with a recorded 164 Watt peak for all of these benchmarks. So while the Framework Desktop performance geo mean was at 1.285x, the total system power consumption was 1.29x higher on average and the peak was 1.38x.  If you are investing in the Dell Pro Max GB10 or any other GB10 platform, chances are though you are running AI workloads and other software fully engaging both the CPU and GPU. The Blackwell GPU with the GB10 offers a lot more compute potential over the Radeon 8060S graphics but similarly the Dell Pro Max GB10 pricing is around $4139 USD as of writing and the Framework Desktop around $2928 USD if going for the same RAM and storage capacity.

Honestly DLSS is a godsend for low vram cards, as the newer models allow much lower resolutions while somehow looking better than older models at quality. It gives the card something to use its muscle on instead of just being vram constrained and running at 70% utilization.   I still have to turn textures down sometimes but the lower resolution from DLSS is often the difference between medium and high textures running smoothly.  Everyone dumped on the 8gb card but if you look at what cards are actually going for now (not the msrp) it's actually not bad. The 8gb version is available for $330 while the 16gb is $520.

The fact that the desktop lineup is basically only one GPU die, and then another GPU that's essentially just the one copy/pasted and glued together, along with this constant reuse of RDNA3.5 for mobile/APU's tells me they really didn't invest much into RDNA4's success at all.

Perf wasn't affected by the memory latency, but if we're talking about SoC power (vs core power), then LNL made significant strides in power budget available to compute. That's one of the biggest factors at lower TDPs (and light loads), actually, because SoC power doesn't scale down as well.   > 5% performance improvement in 1T could be explained by the new SoC/updated core.

AMD,o21mth3,"The new Xeon’s will probably feature the [APX extension.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/advanced-performance-extensions-apx.html)  APX is intended to be what AVX-2 was back in 2012, it is going to set a baseline. It’s directly targeting the parts that sped up ARM.   The main thing is the doubling of the general purpose registers to 32 different registers to keep more data on chip (probably indicative of the modern CPU’s cache increases and their importance for performance). ARM’s has pretty much supported 32 registers for years.   The other big thing is three operand instructions. So instead of doing something like “ADD A,B” which would remove the value in “A” (meaning you have to do another move operation before adding) you can do “ADD A,B,C” which would store the result in “C” without unnecessary moves. ARM has had that for years, but now APX is adding it to x86.   This is probably the next big step towards “true” 64 bit computing rather than the hybrid we had before.   This sort of thing helps power consumption as well. The lack of register pressure and moving around means we aren’t necessarily having to do that as much. You’re saving on flushes and other aspects that ARM had benefited from for years.   Basically, x86 will still be around.   Also this “beef” with x86 and ARM is so tiring.   Right now, we have two manufacturers in AMD and Intel who propose and maintain the x86 instruction set. Any extensions made by one is allowed to be used by the other, due to the cross licensing agreement.

I mean if you have 100% CPU utilization and 15% GPU utilization, maybe you might still see the same number of frames., but if you have 100% CPU utilization and 50% GPU utilization, switch from 1080p to 4K results in 4x the work for the GPU.

AMD,o2pn61a,"When I overclock my RX 6650 XT too far it crashes with a green screen.  It sounds like an OC profile configuration error like perhaps you saved an aggressive overclock through AMD Arenalin.  First thing I would try is a 100Mhz underclock on the GPU and see if it happens.  If you aren't getting the speed promised by an RX 7600 then I would consider an RMA.  The green screen is a very big tell that its an overclock crash, in my opinion.  Anyone with an AMD thats stress tested it in Heaven could tell you that.  Also Heaven is a good benchmark to run in a loop and play with the GPU frequency sliders to check for stability and artifacts.  Mine typically makes zero artifacts and just crashes.  It can't even tolerate even a mild overclock like 2703 core -> 2725 core is about the best it can do.  Mine has 2300mhz ram chips (Its an RX 6650 XT so very similar) so I actually run mine at 2499core/2300 ram and I get like 95% of the performance for 75% of the power.  So it typically draws like 125watts in that configuration and I'm happy with that.  My default never crashes though (2703Mhz), I would be suspicious and potentially RMA the card if that were the case.  You can \*maybe\* try reseating the GPU as maybe it has power delivery issues through the slot or cable.  I'm 100% certain though that green screen crashes are AMD GPU errors, like what you would see from too aggressive of an overclock.  The good thing is its definitely fixable with an underclock.

AMD,o2vp0k5,"At 1440p with your RX 9070 XT, the GPU is still the main driver for performance, but your current Ryzen 5 5500 can start to bottleneck in CPU-heavy games, especially ones with high frame rates or simulation workloads. Moving up to a Ryzen 7 5700X or 5900X will give you more cores and threads, which is helpful for multitasking and modern gaming, but the difference at 1440p is not as dramatic as at 1080p, because the GPU is doing most of the work. The memory configuration you have (16+4 GB) is not ideal. Mismatched DIMMs can impact performance, particularly on AMD platforms where dual-channel operation is crucial. Even if you upgrade the CPU, that memory setup could hold you back slightly. Ideally, a matched 32 GB dual-channel kit would squeeze the most performance out of a 5900X or X3D CPU. As for the X3D chips, they excel in gaming due to the large L3 cache, but at 1440p and with your PCIe 3.0 board, the real-world benefit may be modest. They are expensive and hard to source, so unless you find a deal, the value proposition isn’t great compared to a standard 5900X or even a 5700X. Jumping to AM5 now would solve the memory limitation and future-proof you for PCIe 4.0/5.0 and DDR5, but it comes with significant cost due to new motherboard and RAM prices. If you’re price-sensitive and the goal is mainly to get a modest CPU improvement at 1440p, staying on AM4 with a 5700X or 5900X is reasonable. You’ll reduce bottlenecks for CPU-heavy titles and keep most of your investment intact. So in short: for 1440p gaming, upgrading to a 5700X or 5900X gives you a tangible benefit without the high costs of AM5/X3D. Don’t stress too much about PCIe 3.0 or DDR4; your GPU will still be the main factor for FPS.

AMD,o2udqp2,Ddr4 pricing is starting to get bad enough it doesn’t really make sense to invest anything on am4 now. 16gb is on the low end of ram usage nowadays but AM5 long term gives you a much cheaper upgrade relevant upgrade path. AM4 you’re more or less done as the only sensible upgrade on AM4 from the 5600xt is a 5700x3d/5800x3d and they cost more than like a 9800x3d.   Even if you can get a 32gb ddr4 equipped bundle it just means later down the line you’re going to have to invest way more to upgrade. Some of the games you mentioned aren’t going to run poorly on the am4 setup but it won’t be great and will show its age now.  Get the micro center bundle and if you can add more ram or find a bundle with 32gb in your price range. I know they have a few of those starting around $550 and a 7800x3d bundle for $600. If you can’t save up for those I’d still get the 16gb bundle now.  AM5 has at least one more upcoming generation of releases and possibly more as AMD is having to adapt to this new market.

AMD,o2uf4h0,"It is twice the capacity but about half the bandwidth of DDR5. Bandwidth is measured in GB per second. High memory bandwidth is useful in tasks like video editing amd 3D rendering, but not as much in gaming. If you multitask while you game: streaming, browser windiws open, other software open, etc. then the capacity will be more beneficial to you than bandwidth. If you are mainly using this to ""do stuff"" then the DDR5 *could* be more beneficial, unless having only 16GB would hamstring you in applications that like RAM capacity. Using software that loads large datasets would probably benefit from more capacity vs bandwidth.   Also one thing to consider is due to the high cost of DDR5, the more affordable kits will have high latency compared to DDR4. Having low latency RAM is important for a lot of games. Example: let's say the only RAM you can afford is either a 16GB 5600 CL36 kit of DDR5 @$226 or 32GB of DDR4 at 3200 CL16 for $220 (current Amazon prices) the DDR5 has a latency of 13 nanoseconds and the DDR4 has a latency of 10 nanoseconds. The DDR4 is actually faster, relatively speaking. The equivalent DDR5 speeds that have 10ns latency is 6000 CL30, and those 32GB DDR5 kits are $480.

My 1 TB NVMe is rated for 600 TBW. Keep in mind, that's just for the warranty. Such products generally last longer than what the warranty period specifies.  AM4 is too expensive. I was about to give my buddy for free an AM4 motherboard, 32 GB DDR4, and a PSU that I have in storage and the cost was like $1300-$1400 when you include a 5700X3D, a 5060 Ti 16 GB, storage, and other necessary accessories combined. For a few hundred more you can get a prebuilt AM5 system that would provide a greater performance benefit (hard to say spending $1300-$1400 for a 30% performance boost in one of his favorite games is worth it).  I would advise anyone who wants a decent gaming PC to save up for a newer prebuild unless they come across a good deal.  Moore's law is not everything. It's now about including new features to make up for the lack of raw performance increases. So for example, the raw performance with each GPU gen is getting more disappointing, but it is partially offset by newer features like multiframe generation, better raytracing, DLSS, etc. Or often times in CPUs, a bigger cache,  You can get a significant performance boost going from a 14900k to a 9800X3D in CPU bound gaming scenarios because of the extra cache. Zen6 and Intel Nova Lake will have a lot to offer. Zen6 will include more cores on one CCD (12 instead of 8) and probably more cache. Intel Nova Lake will include a significant amount of more cores.

AMD,o2kho9h,"Hey man so I recommend doing some good research into what makes a pc work. The main things are as you’ve listed: CPU, GPU, Motherboard, RAM, Storage, and the PSU. For your case specifically you want a GPU, PSU, and cpu+motherboard upgrade, in order of importance.  Don’t worry about your RAM or SSD. 32GB ddr4 is a great place to be right now with how prices are, and storage is equally expensive. If you store a bunch of stuff you don’t regularly use then get a hard drive. If your SSD is more full than 80%, delete stuff until it’s less full. SSDs are fast, but they use the first available storage, and if you fill them beyond around 80% the latency between reads and writes increases dramatically. (If you fill a closet by putting things in the front first, it becomes significantly harder to put things in the back as the closet fills up.)  Your GPU is most specifically what gives you gaming performance. The rx 570 is gonna be what’s holding you back the most. It’s outdated, and slow by modern standards. You’re gonna want an RTX 3060 12GB equivalent or better going forward, and with that you’ll have drastically better gaming performance. An RTX 3060 won’t be future proof, but it will be better. The newer your card, the better off you’ll be in the future. This draws two big questions however. Power draw, and PCIE generation  A newer card will be more power efficient so it may not necessarily have a higher TDP (power draw), but it may very well require a different PCIE power connector. The RX 570 has generally a 6 pin power connector, but you may have an 8 pin variant. Every new graphics card you look at will require an 8 pin or better power connector. If you don’t have the proper power connector for the new GPU, it will not work.  Because of the power connector problem, you’ll want to do research into what your PSU currently is. Look at what PCIE power connectors it currently has, and what wattage it’s rated for. When you upgrade your GPU, this is a good thing to upgrade as well.  PCIE generation also matters. The slot that connects your motherboard to your GPU is called the PCI Express slot. They have different generations as hardware gets newer and newer. Newer generations have more bandwidth, and higher data speeds. Your motherboard and CPU are PCIE gen 3.0. Newer gpus are rated for 4.0 or 5.0. If you only upgrade your GPU, you may see it getting a 5%-20% decrease in performance compared to standard benchmarks using the newest PCIE generation. This isn’t a huge deal, but may be something to consider for the future.  Your cpu and motherboard would be good to upgrade down the line to unlock your full GPU performance. Your current CPU may bottleneck a better GPU as well. This would cause even further performance loss from the new GPU. However your motherboard is compatible with all AM4 CPU’s other than the top of the line ones rated above 105W. With a simple BIOS update you can slot in a great 5000 series 5600x or 5700x and get better performance without worrying about the PCIE generation bullshit right now.",buildapc,2026-01-30 08:21:16,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8510656), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1034, 'end': 1035}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85322374), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1152, 'end': 1153}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5946906), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 1421, 'end': 1423}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67044675), 'word': 'PC', 'start': 1480, 'end': 1482}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7939937), 'word': 'RX', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}]",Tópico 4

GPU- RTX 3060 12GB on the lowest end will give you dramatically better performance for $200-$250. As others have recommended, RX 9060 XT will give you significantly better performance than an RTX 3060 12GB for $300-$400. If you’re willing to spend more it’s by far the best deal you’ll get for MSRP on a GPU. $200-$400.  PSU- get a nice bequite 750W or any C tier or higher on the cultist network tier list for between $80-$120  CPU- as another person recommended, r5 5500 will give you a sizable CPU performance boost for $90. Make sure to update your bios first. Even the R5 5600 would be a sizable upgrade to that as it supports pcie gen 4, has higher clock speeds, and more cache, but I wouldn’t upgrade to this if you don’t upgrade your motherboard. Also, it’s double the price, but not nearly double the performance. You could go for a better cpu like a r7 5700X with 8 cores, but you won’t see a change in performance more than 10% over the r5 5600. $90-$200  Motherboard- not too complicated if you don’t care about tons of features.

In the pic there’s a USB fan blowing air on it - I later found it it was useless and the difference is negligible   -30CO all core, I can still float around 4.9GHz while gaming on this thing. It’ll hit 79-82C. I’m not worried whatsoever.  My desktop PC runs a 42mmx360mm AIO on a 7800X3D. I didn’t build it that way, it’s just the AIO I had upgrading from a 9900K. My temps are lower, but performance is more or less the same. I might see 5050MHz all core at times but to me that’s more silicon lottery than anything. The 3d vcache being placed on top of the chiplet really ruins any real gains you could get from better cooling. These things all hit 4.7-5.0ghz while sipping on minimal power and consequently minimal heat.  9800X3D? Starts to make more sense with better cooling and an unlocked multiplier.

If they've been around a long time, they may be insisting on going with liquid cooling because they believe anything over 75C or so could damage the CPU, and for old CPUs that was actually the case.

AMD,o2ou62v,"It’s not a gimmick, and it’s getting pretty old watching the recieved wisdom in here oscillate between aggressively pro liquid or air.    They both serve a purpose.  Sure, if you’re judging by cooling capacity per dollar in a full atx case, air is way (way) better.  But that’s not the only metric.   First off, in certain form factors and certain cases, liquid cooling is practically mandatory.  There simply isn’t room, and airflow will be a nightmare with the gpu mashed against an air cooler.  Some popular, good cases are designed to be liquid cooled.   Second, liquid cooling does generally offer better cooling, if that’s all you’re looking for.  A 360mm aio might not be *necessary* for most consumer chips, but that doesn’t mean a good one won’t outperform every air cooler.  The difference isn’t significant enough to be worth the money in most situations… but there’s still a difference. It’s all about surface area.   Third, and probably the biggest reason why I personally stick with aios, is that it’s just easier.  In my current build I would have to remove the cooler, reapply thermal paste, and reseat it just to replace the ram, add an m.2 drive, and really almost anything else on the mobo.  An air cooler, especially a good one (again, all about surface area) is a real pain in the ass to work around.  An aio gets the bulk out of the way.  If you’re an upgrader or a tinkerer spending an extra 75 bucks just to get the cooler off the mobo can be worth it.

AIOs and custom loops just trade the heatpipes for water hoses so that you can move the ""hot"" part from a restricted area (above a cpu) to somewhere else.   What matters in either is the cooling surface and the capacity of transferring heat from the radiator (be it the cooling tower on top of the cpu or the radiator on the other side of the loop) to the atmosphere. Reason why it is perceived that an AIO looks like it cools better it's because it's really hard to get an air tower with more cooling surface than a 360mm or bigger radiator, to fit inside a case on top of the cpu, even considering the amount of thermal mass (that you are definitely restricted to be at a temperature slightly above ambient), that an AIO, or even a custom loop has.",buildapc,2026-01-30 15:55:07,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.79591966), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 541, 'end': 543}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8218473), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 857, 'end': 859}]",Tópico 1

I like the AOC has 0.3ms response time.  Maybe see if can go with a more reliable brand at 27"" 1440p but lower refresh rate if that gets it in similar price range.

System: Intel i5 12400, 32GB ddr4 ram, 1000W psu, Asus TUF RX 9070. Nothing overclocked. Default Adrenaline settings. Main display: 1920x1080@240hz Second display: 2560x1440@60hz  I've had this issue since I first installed my rx 9070. It's been driving me crazy, being new to AMD after a long time made me think it was just me. I never had this happen before on my system, so when the only change was replacing my gtx 1060, it didn't make sense. Went through it all, replaced the PSU, clean windows installs, new and old driver reinstalls, stress testing my system(showed no issues), changing bios settings etc. Even reseated RAM and GPU, replugged cables, flipped bios on GPU. Sent multiple bug reports through adrenaline software with all data I could find.  I use Firefox and it wouldn't happen so often, but it was still frustrating when it did, so I swapped to Edge. Thought it was just a Firefox problem because it seemed like it wasn't going to timeout, until it did. Tried Chrome, happened on my first attempt. Back to Firefox now and after a recent update, v147, it looks to be stable. It could have been windows updates being helpful, though there was no description of this problem in the change logs. This occurred from driver 25.9.1 to 25.12.1. Haven't tried Chrome and Edge again since I don't use them normally, but I did it at the time to try and find a solution.  I opened a bug report on Firefox: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433)  After all of this, I think it is not a browser specific issue, though at first I thought it was. But I do think that for whatever reason, hardware accelerated programmes displaying media as it is drawn in or interacted with, on a second display, have a chance to cause a driver timeout. What made this clear was when I simply scrolled in Discord one time and it timed out, as it is also hardware accelerated.

AMD,o0z30iu,"You know what? I've been having the same problem. Not with Chromium apps per-se, as I use Firefox, but I've had a hanging problem happening for the last few months which happens at pure random. Only when playing / scrubbing through video in Firefox or VLC. The hang usually happens very quickly after starting playback. I've also crashed it with Vegas Pro, which also uses the Media Engine.  But I can run video for hours, or game + play video for hours, and have absolutely no timeout. But if I lock and unlock my PC, I might get a hang 1/50 times. Or if I spend a half hour or so scrubbing through video, which is heavily stop and go. Eventually I'll crash it.  There is also a REALLY annoying VRAM memory leak I've been trying to track down. I caught Discord once using over 8GB of VRAM. It's another one of those random and intermittent things which shows up, but doesn't correspond with any GPU usage. Only uptime.  I can't crash the card with only games, or with any stress test though. Even tried OCCT with variable and fixed loads. No crash. No errors. Even tried both of the BIOSs, which were both stable for a good two years, with my card.  EDIT: Hopefully not just speaking too soon, but I remembered that my card has a problem with one of the DisplayPort outputs.

If you have a task where memory bandwidth and latency sensitivities are VERY high and the need for communication between threads is relatively low then the task would work better spread across two CCDs with tons of cache. One hypothetical would be background tasks (windows, etc.) on their own CCD and whatever minor spill over there is from a game also living there.

They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

AMD,nxugtl3,">We need to stop looking at the Core Ultra 9 285K through the lens of a typical generational refresh  That's all what consumers care about. They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.

AMD,nxvyiba,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable?

Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.
