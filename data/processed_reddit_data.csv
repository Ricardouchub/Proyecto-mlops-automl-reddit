Intel,npclgdx,"It'll happen eventually but they have a few issues.  First is memory bandwidth, they'd need to put a wider bus on it to address which is costly.  Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power.

Intel,nnj4lq1,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.

Is there any greater penalty (latency or cache-flush-wise) for moving threads off the LP-island to P-cores?  *Thanks for the insides so far though!* I can't really see through anymore to all these constant arch-changes.",hardware,2025-11-08 04:12:06,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9700972), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 27, 'end': 29}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9627577), 'word': 'E', 'start': 30, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7856819), 'word': 'M', 'start': 235, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89533246), 'word': 'MTL', 'start': 258, 'end': 261}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7244176), 'word': 'ARL', 'start': 262, 'end': 265}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.963476), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 268, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91517335), 'word': 'E', 'start': 271, 'end': 272}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9977799), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 650, 'end': 655}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9967327), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 662, 'end': 667}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.61986643), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 691, 'end': 693}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78710175), 'word': 'MTL', 'start': 704, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9685737), 'word': 'LNL', 'start': 943, 'end': 946}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8394272), 'word': 'PTL', 'start': 947, 'end': 950}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8412905), 'word': 'N', 'start': 951, 'end': 952}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96165675), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 979, 'end': 981}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95923644), 'word': 'E', 'start': 982, 'end': 983}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.39727062), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 1060, 'end': 1062}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.32601485), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 1239, 'end': 1241}]",Tópico 4

Intel,nito8rq,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",hardware,2025-10-10 19:19:56,-3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5901536), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 478, 'end': 480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95915806), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 657, 'end': 664}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5589056), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 840, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84580344), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 861, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8949823), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 872, 'end': 874}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83673733), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 897, 'end': 899}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9113381), 'word': 'Steam H', 'start': 960, 'end': 967}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90570134), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1045, 'end': 1051}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8788991), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1331, 'end': 1337}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

Intel,ne6f8e1,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

Intel,netnyfa,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,27,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99808574), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6214537), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.52357626), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99834645), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83350486), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99116546), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8770928), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99863094), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9641192), 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9881471), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96866584), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5841442), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980452), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99846077), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99331963), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81863767), 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89312124), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9982552), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47448224), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9968098), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9972773), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961228), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 4

TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614332), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.604474), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.420649), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713005), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 1

TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

Intel,noy0ero,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",pcmasterrace,2025-11-15 07:22:01,1,Positive,Anger,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91723), 'word': 'Arc B', 'start': 7, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9098244), 'word': 'R', 'start': 64, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.9685042), 'word': 'Ya', 'start': 250, 'end': 252}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.90118825), 'word': '##za Ki', 'start': 254, 'end': 259}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96355784), 'word': 'PS3', 'start': 417, 'end': 420}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.9579374), 'word': 'Ki', 'start': 478, 'end': 480}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84165114), 'word': 'Y', 'start': 492, 'end': 493}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7486298), 'word': 'D', 'start': 775, 'end': 776}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8886655), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 983, 'end': 987}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5099653), 'word': '##G', 'start': 1027, 'end': 1028}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99695504), 'word': 'Java', 'start': 1067, 'end': 1071}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6577854), 'word': 'OpenG', 'start': 1076, 'end': 1081}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93386745), 'word': 'Mesa', 'start': 1122, 'end': 1126}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8307983), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1131, 'end': 1138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9525027), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1214, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7680797), 'word': 'OpenGL', 'start': 1234, 'end': 1240}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9644679), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1256, 'end': 1263}]",Tópico 2

I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.

When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency.

If anything we are in a drought as tech is no longer having big gains as the best nvidia and amd can do is make bigger chips and pushing more wattage.   Its not just devs or engines its hardware manufacturers no longer able to keep up. Since every time pc gaming looks to stabilize we get a big boom and something spikes and those prices stay. As of now everything past 2020 is just price gouging that you paid for. Your money to performance is worse than ever before and you paid for it. You should be mad at nvidia with messing with their stacks. Then increasing the prices. Next gen is only to get worse.   The way I see it top end gpus have a harder time keeping up with what unreal 5 wants to do and since nvidia cuts the stack by 40% for the next tier down their is no gains on moving up unless you move up a tier.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware?

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 4

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.780761), 'word': 'YouTube', 'start': 186, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.632216), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 202, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89879507), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52583975), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 211, 'end': 213}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71377695), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 213, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56497085), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 266, 'end': 268}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",AMD,2024-04-01 02:18:57,28,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96870226), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9156764), 'word': 'I', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9579422), 'word': 'M', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6767603), 'word': 'N', 'start': 78, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.69673014), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 79, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8865069), 'word': '##DI', 'start': 81, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98826766), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 142, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81870246), 'word': 'VFIO', 'start': 220, 'end': 224}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004071), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 270, 'end': 273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97644997), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 355, 'end': 358}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78370017), 'word': 'V', 'start': 478, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9868846), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8120332), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 637, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40551057), 'word': 'M', 'start': 679, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7868693), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 721, 'end': 727}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.657153), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 746, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99238694), 'word': 'Debian', 'start': 835, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86615694), 'word': 'Proxmox', 'start': 865, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936753), 'word': 'N', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81987095), 'word': '##utanix', 'start': 906, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9508743), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 923, 'end': 929}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9956404), 'word': 'Broadcom', 'start': 941, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9882114), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7132545), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93465674), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1279, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91439724), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658943), 'word': 'Spice', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 3

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized?

Intel,k755j7t,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.949649), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378605), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84053415), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6853485), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 5

But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets.

And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu.

The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.

I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Intel,2025-11-06 07:19:59,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51401126), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 292, 'end': 294}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9971359), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 314, 'end': 319}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98042005), 'word': 'PowerVia', 'start': 489, 'end': 497}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99182194), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 647, 'end': 649}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98752546), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 899, 'end': 902}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9622613), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 995, 'end': 1005}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98830426), 'word': 'Fire Range', 'start': 1016, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.80416733), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 1204, 'end': 1206}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49430886), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1316, 'end': 1317}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9173438), 'word': 'U', 'start': 1512, 'end': 1513}]",Tópico 1

In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread.

Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.

Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away.

AMD,nphtq7s,"$1000 also isn't a great look for a console killer. Between Sony releasing the PS5 Pro at a really steep price ($750/€800), both Microsoft jacking up the Xbox Series price (X for $650) and Sony doing the same (PS5 for $550) and Nintendo charging quite a bit more for the Switch 2 ($450) I'd say there's an opening here for a Steam Machine to enter the console market.  If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console... Not a bad sales pitch.  BTW, lots of people are using a Steam Deck as their main console. If millions are happy with Deck performance, this is more than enough.

AMD,npj9v4j,"The same reason Intel's Lunar Lake was a one-off.  Companies run a percentage profit margin they report to their investors. If they produce a good that costs 50$ to make, and sell it for 100$, then they have a profit margin of 50%. For investors this means that every dollar they put into production results in 2 dollars of capital, which is a good indicator for potential growth, and, of course, potential dividend payout.  If costs increase by 10$, then, if price were left unchanged, their profit margin would sink to 40%. if They increase their price by 10$ as well their profit margin would sink to ~55%. Investors will look at those numbers and conclude that the company is doing poorly: it is no longer able to achieve the same return on investment that it did previously, and they might just conclude that their money can be better spent elsewhere and cancel further investments.  So, a 10$ cost increase results in a 20$ price hike. In reality, profit margins aren't really that high for third-parties like Asus and others, investors can be persuaded that the costs aren't due to mismanagement and companies will take a hit in profitability in the short-run to maintain marketshare (although, again, AIB companies generally run razor-thin profit margins).  Another reason for adding margin to price-hikes is Machiavellian psychology: Gigabyte and others know the way the wind is blowing, RAM prices are going to keep climbing for the foreseeable future and people respond worse to smaller price increases every month than a big price increase every 6 months. So they'll add some padding now, 'worst' case they can drop the price later or give greater discounts during sales, best case they're better insulated from any future inflation.",hardware,2025-11-18 18:29:07,9,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99806935), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 16, 'end': 21}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5744266), 'word': 'Luna', 'start': 24, 'end': 28}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6070794), 'word': '##r', 'start': 28, 'end': 29}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7573541), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 30, 'end': 34}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70139563), 'word': 'Asus', 'start': 1016, 'end': 1020}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99683046), 'word': 'AIB', 'start': 1209, 'end': 1212}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.86995214), 'word': 'Machiavellian', 'start': 1317, 'end': 1330}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72139394), 'word': 'Giga', 'start': 1343, 'end': 1347}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9108642), 'word': 'RAM', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1400}]",Tópico 1

This is a fairly straightforward optimization problem. Total profit = per unit profit \* volume. There's also a tradeoff between per unit profit and volume: The higher the per unit profit (and therefore sale price) the lower the volume, and vice versa. When per unit profit is zero then total profit is zero, and likewise when volume is zero total profit is also zero. Somewhere between those two extremes there's a point of maximum total profit. Because per unit profit is price - cost, a change is cost is going to have a relatively larger effect on per unit profits, possibly even putting it negative without a price change. This will cause the optimal price point to move towards higher per unit profit, lower volume. This is what causes the price to go even higher than just the increase in cost.

To me it's like you're building a table for 8 hours and getting $200 in labour and praying $100 in wood, tools, etc. you'd probably charge $300 for the table. $100+$200.  33.3% is your cost in parts, and 66.6% is your profit margins that is also your hourly pay in a way.   Now imagine your parts cost went up by $100 to $200. Do you now charge $200+$200? (You pass the cost onto the consumer) Or do you charge $200 for parts/supplies plus ANOTHER $400 for the labour, because you think the 100% increase parts/supplies cost also justifies you getting a 100% hourly wage increase. After all, you want to maintain the same 66.6% margin. $200-$400.   I think in a small business like this, that would be insane to demand you get double the annual revenue and profit margin in salary. If I went from 66k a year annual net income to 133k, because my supplies cost went from 33k to 66k, that would be weird. Now admittedly, you'd sell a lot fewer tables, so you'd probably not hit those yearly goals. But in part that's your own fault for doubling your table sale price.   The second you have investors, it's suddenly justifiable though. Which to me makes the system look broken.  Personally I think what's going on is that that WANT to sell less gaming GPUs.

AMD,npqu54i,"You analogy makes even less sense, and keep mixing up what you're actually calculating, and muddying the water by adding the materials in there. My point was that it's fair to ask for more money based on how much you've invested, be that either time (hours worked) or money (buying materials)      Philosophically: If my profit margin is 100% based on the labor, an increase in cost of materials has no impact on it.    You ALSO forgot to account for the cost of you time, i.e. how much are these 8 hours worth if I'm not building this table. What is 8 hours at minimum wage? What's 8 hours working for somebody elses company worth? This is opportunity cost. You're just assuming the labour is 100% profit, which breaks real-word profitability analysis.    To make it fair, you should be calculating the cost of hiring someone to build the table, and you then sell it. You're not going to have 66.6% profit margins.  Anyway...  If the parts cost goes up to $200, and my hours worked stays the same, an absolute minimum price would be $400. And especially if you market your services as ""no profit on materials, only work"". You might do this, because sales/VAT taxation reasons like if materials are taxed higher, but labour is lower. So you give a receipt for materials, bill them as paid-for (0 profit) and then bill your work.    This way of doing things, your profit margin technically doesn't change, since the material is expensed at-cost, your business is selling your labor. You're just expensing the materials, not selling it to the customer. It's almost a balance sheet transaction, that doesn't appear on the P&L.

AMD,npqt711,"Well, it seems AMD has something... Sarcasm aside, nice to see DF's input on this 'early look' of FSR RR.  A lot of strange things observed. With the same settings AMD has some things omitted compared to Nvidia, as seen with shadows in a distance, it's quality, as well with objects reflected like with lights (can't say for sure if this an AMDs or dev thing, regardless it doesn't matter to the end user to who's fault).  With FSR RR, the most noticeable spotted difference from at first glance is the retrieval quality and AA from the reconstructed/regenerated scene. DLSS RR is better which shouldn't be shocking. This is due to how AMD does their upscaling passes with RR, as you can choose whatever upscaling method you want with RR and how it can be clearly seen with water reflections. FSR4 Perf is noticeably blurrier than FSR4 Native when comparing the reflections in the water, while it wouldn't matter what DLSS quality setting you use in conjunction w/ DLSS RR. As an aside, I found it interesting how FSR4 Perf had better texture detail on the letters than DLSS4 Perf (that said perhaps could be a sharpening thing outside of the upscalers used).  Moving on, FSR RR has missing features as noted with how reflections should be reconstructed. Reflected objects/scenes do not correctly diffuse, and are sharp throughout (typing this, I use [10:20](https://youtu.be/RuASMLRGFus?si=p1ECIQiTwNLLxeT0&t=617), but interestingly enough w/ DLSS RR, the gun has noticeable artifcating maybe due to the denoiser?). Environments with FSR RR do not have correct contact lighting as seen with the part about the trash can.  AMD does have some things going for it (though, I suspect is more per game basis). In motion, DLSS RR while clearer experiences more ghosting/smearing elements compared to FSR RR. That said, can't be said for the disocclusion aspect as seen with swapping guns with water in the foreground (that said I wonder if this is again the same problem with the upscaler/denoiser pass with FSR RR or if the problems with game settings between AMD and Nvidia has something to do with it like SSR).  There are things to note about performance, but isn't wildly different, so I won't make comments there.  Overall, again strange to say the least. It's obvious FSR RR isn't quite done, which can be worrying considering it's still one part of Redstone. Also, the game itself isn't a good test bed for the feature (as if it only being enabled for MP wasn't obvious enough) as there are bugs and instabilities. I guess, if anything, AMD has a step in the door which will have improvements. That said, isn't quite like with FSR4 in terms of wow. Not only that FSR4 can easily be swapped with Optiscaler and recently in AMD's own driver with most DX12 games.

AMD,npqva0w,"Yeah, IIRC when FSR FG released, the Square Enix game that was poorly received, had frame pacing problems. It was then around when Avatar released FSR FG was solid and at the time in terms of performance was quite competitive with DLSS3 FG's HW accelerated Optical Flow overhead.  Reality is, no one should really expect AMD to have Nvidia features day one or even have parity.

Enable FG and it's hitting my monitor refresh rate, with the base framerate high enough that the input lag doesn't feel bad.  Even Cyberpunk is fully playable with path tracing if you're willing to drop down to FSR 4 balanced. It sits at around 45-60 FPS, or around 90-110 FPS with frame gen. Obviously path tracing doesn't look all that great without an ML denoiser, but it's completely playable with PT on, and will look absolutely stunning once we get RR on AMD, not to mention feel even better if NRC works in the game, since it should yield a 20-30% boost in PT performance.

AMD,nogei5r,"(Peak) Multi-thread performance is not necessarily the right way to look at the addition of more cores. Software support is just not mature enough with most approach still just trying to parallelize one task even well beyond reasonable scaling, making large core counts seem useless.  Once core counts where naive scaling approaches break too often become common, we'll start to see a shift revealing more benefits of having a lot of cores. Task preemption which was the foundation of modern complex systems may be eventually demoted to a last resort solution for keeping misbehaving processes in line.  Spreading processes to different cores generally reduces the peak performance requirement, so cores can be operated at a lower frequency, with lower voltage greatly increasing efficiency.  Tasks sticking to specific cores without getting preempted and moved around also increases efficiency, and reduces the occurrence and impact of worst case latency penalties.  Software is just way too behind hardware, but throwing faster hardware at the problem still works, so problems are not getting fixed. For example it's amusing to see that single CCD AMD CPUs are the most common for gaming, not because they are good enough, but because dual CCD CPUs just perform worse for the average gamer.  A Linux gaming setup with a container and/or Wine limited to a single CCD with the other CCD being used for the rest of the system is the superior approach to Windows bloatware services and background processes competing with the game for the resources of the same CCD, but the later is what's the easiest to setup/get for most users, so that's what they will plan builds for.  A lot of games also just spawn one software thread per hardware thread per thread manager, which stops reasonably scaling after a point. It may be worthy to even attempt to lie about having only 8 hardware threads, then spread around the mess on 8 cores with SMT more efficiently handling the overcommitment.  Browser loads may not be even worthy of a lot of analysis. Website design regressed to the point where latency hiding is intentionally prevented, and an incredible amount of bloatware logic is expected to be processed serially.",hardware,2025-11-12 13:51:38,5,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9476321), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1296, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9944273), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 1453, 'end': 1460}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nohn51a,"There's a performance benefit to keeping everything else away from the CCD occupied by the game. There aren't a whole lot of people remaining who close everything else anymore when starting a game, and starting from (late?) Windows 10, it's even hard to get rid of a lot of unnecessary background tasks.  It's a bit hard to judge objectively though, because Windows doesn't have containers necessary for proper testing, and Linux is already often faster even without scheduling changes, so it's not feasible to compare the two platforms. A Linux test with one CCD disabled, then both enabled but the game constrained to one CCD could be interesting, but then Linux on its own isn't heavy in the background, so the test would be greatly affected by the choice of extra programs running, where heavy hitters like Discord would start favoring the 2 CCD setup significantly.  I'm not out of touch with more budget conscious people, but if it wasn't obvious, I wanted to point out that even the people who typically spend a lot more of minimal or only perceived benefit go with a single CCD this time, because on their setup (typical Windows gaming), 2 CCDs actually result in worse performance.  It's on software even to the point of Intel attempting to help the industry with best practices: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/optimizing-threading-for-gaming-performance.html (although this one gets more specific to their architecture, even if it still mentions concurrency limitations).

Yeah, blew my mind too, how people would be so dumb and shortsighted, to actually play right into nVidia's hands and reward them for that — The constant covert down-tearing while at the same time openly jack up price-tags (and thus essentially sell last-gen's performance-class now at a *higher* price-point and tier, than on their last gen before), was always blatant profiteering with every new generation …  I remember a lot of people, who manically refreshed all these price-trackers every couple of minutes, only to get a chance for throwing away +$1,800–2,000 USD for the top-tier nVidia-card back then.  nVidia just out-played these fools using psychological mind-games over their own wounded pride and grandstanding (since that's actually what it always came down to). Jensen most definitely had a lot of sh!t and giggles pulling that every new generation, while laughing on his way to the bank for sure …  > I'm just blown away people kept buying and paying $3k+ for 5090s. They've basically guaranteed the 6090 will be $2500 msrp.  I think they can count themselves lucky if it's ""only"" +$2,500 USD by now. nVidia will most likely go for the throat and make it more like +$3,200–3,500 USD, essentially sell off their cards at +$2,500–2,800 USD at a minimum.  *Using artificial scarcity, has been literally the oldest trick in the book of cut-throat merchants since time immemorial*.  Though in all fairness, nVidia basically just took a page of Apple's book here, since Cupertino started all that sh!t with the iPhone already prior, or their MacBooks — *Remember the black MacBook back then, which was WAY pricier for just being black and +50 MHz?* Campuses back then were full of people having the black one in no time, virtue signaling, they'd belong to be off the class of the better-off students …  I actually knew a gal, who in all seriousness ate nothing but crisp bread and orange-juice for a months plus, only to have the money for the black MacBook!

No, you're wrong.

In any case, by the time AMD was taking onto R&D for anything Ryzen in 2012, their financials actually mostly recovered through external investments and the aiding console-deals (Work on Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One began around 2010–2011) … These ""peanuts"" of their custom-semi division mostly saved their day-to-day.

AMD,np0c7uj,"1) The N150 is part of the same family, just a little bit “overclocked”. It isn’t a literally a new gen (same socket FCBGA1264, both based on Alder Lake cores, even if they have different naming (Twin Lake) because the dates of launch) but a “refresh”. It doesn’t have anything “new”.  And that’s logical. As I explained, this CPUs have a very thin economic margin, so they must use internal capacity of their nodes. And they still haven’t upgraded them since the N100 introduction. Also, the making of new e-Cores (again, given they won’t invest a lot on them given the margins) isn’t coming before 2026-2027 as earliest.  2) The N100 family runs correctly. Heck, I’m using in a desktop a N6005 (with Fedora I must say) no problem, playing 2K YouTube videos, sometimes +30 tabs, and mild multitasking (browser + another browser + Libreoffice)  I don’t know how your experience is even possible, 4 cores at 100% opening browser? Slow? It isn’t certainly the usual experience even if using Win11  I would say something else is at play, like low RAM availability (4-8GB?), slow SSD, bloated Windows or something else.  You can see benchmarks, the N100 is about the same performance as an Intel i5 8250U, and I know people even using that at their workplace no problem. Something is up with your PC, not the CPU.  In any case, I recommend you running Linux with this low resources things and avoid Windows 11 bloat.  3) That AMD you link has worse iGPU depending what you do (Intel QSV for encoding/decoding is miles ahead of AMD), and anyway, its GPU isn’t really a factor given at this performances you won’t be gaming precisely.

AMD,nmbgrrq,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,nmeds5z,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one. And the passage of time now positions early RDNA as a temporary measure, a stopgap until AMD figures out how to get back in the fight.  It remains quietly amusing how utterly wrong the YouTubers and online forums have misread the future about five-six years ago. Architecture/features/support, as it turns out, matter more than raster parity at a 5-10% discount.",hardware,2025-10-31 16:54:04,6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9718374), 'word': 'R', 'start': 76, 'end': 77}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.42423245), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 78, 'end': 80}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91033673), 'word': 'R', 'start': 105, 'end': 106}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5144856), 'word': 'R', 'start': 117, 'end': 118}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76329285), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 119, 'end': 121}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6393619), 'word': 'R', 'start': 305, 'end': 306}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94805515), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 402, 'end': 406}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.73335314), 'word': 'RX', 'start': 464, 'end': 466}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93588954), 'word': 'R', 'start': 536, 'end': 537}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97308636), 'word': 'HairWorks', 'start': 696, 'end': 705}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95992434), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 806, 'end': 808}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98625195), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 880, 'end': 883}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56247264), 'word': 'R', 'start': 907, 'end': 908}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.3213744), 'word': 'R', 'start': 917, 'end': 918}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50909925), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1076, 'end': 1077}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5630991), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1100, 'end': 1101}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9142218), 'word': 'N', 'start': 1187, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.3297731), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 1188, 'end': 1190}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83098423), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 1190, 'end': 1193}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91309756), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1209, 'end': 1210}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96880114), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1246, 'end': 1247}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5374484), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1485, 'end': 1486}]",Tópico 2

I can see why people are upset, but I also see it as AMD being transparent. Their older cards are in 'maintenance mode' now, which means they are still supported, will still get bug fixes, will still work with your games, but if you want the best experience, buy a newer card.

AMD,nmbeqwq,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.

AMD,nmkm4ow,"Fine wine definitely was a thing back with the GCN architecture. Part of GPU drivers is bug fixes, but the whole game ready part is Nvidia/AMD optimizing games for the developer. Back with GCN the AMD architecture was a bit more complex and developers used it poorly. Developers did stupid things like tessellating concrete barriers and the surface of the water to hell and back. So over time you would have real gains and the AMD cards would have a better lifespan than their Nvidia counterparts. The RX 580 was phenomenal.  I would call the fine wine back in the day more shitty developers than shitty drivers.  Fine wine ended with RDNA, it was much simpler to optimize and all over the consoles. That means RX 5000 series going forward don't get those same bumps over time and we've seen it.  AMD fans repeating fine wine these days are talking about a golden age of Radeon that has long since ended without ever having experienced it themselves.  The better aging has been on the Nvidia side with things like DLSS squeezing more performance out of cards.

AMD,nmbrxh6,">AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs.  That's not what they do. They freeze development by branching the code bases off. This effectively means they no longer do development on the legacy branch.   Even in theory fixing bugs in old unmaintained code is difficult because it stops looking like the cold you're working on on a  regular basis. But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing. This happens quite frequently. These GPUs are only a few years old , some 5 years max.   >If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it.   They won't.

If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  They've never done this for the legacy Vega branch. It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.   Yes this applies to all sorts of GCN hardware because they're extremely capable still. You can do shader emulated ray tracing on Vega and RDNA1 with playable performance.on Linux.

AMD,nmdmdmo,"> On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level, and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.  I think that's a little bit unfair towards AMD. On the kernel side, they put in the work with amdgpu, writing parts of it from scratch *and* getting it being accepted into the mainline kernel - which is a steep barrier to entry (the battles on the LKML were a fascinating read :) ), but which makes long-term support infinitely more viable due to the nature of Linux kernel development.

You could even include a bunch of tests with arbitrary units like 3D mark and still get meaningful rankings, as long as all your measurement units are consistent in the sense that higher always means better (or the other way around). The only thing you have to be careful about is that the units of your geomean score will be completely arbitrary and shouldn't be interpreted as any real-world analogue. It's only good for telling whether system A is better than B and how big relatively the gap between them is. Arguably even in the case where the choice of units across all tests is the same (FPS), the geomean FPS isn't a particularly meaningful number.  Which brings me to the question, why would you want to use the harmonic mean instead? What exactly is the question you're trying to answer?  Let's say for example, you want to assume that a player is going to play each of the games from the test suite for an hour, then calculate what the average framerate they're going to experience will be. Since average framerate = total # of frames / total time played, an arithmetic mean of the per-game FPS scores will do the job just fine. In reality, nobody is going to play the exact same games for exact same amounts of time, so maybe it's better for players to calculate their own weighted averages based on their own habits.  Now let's say on the other hand, you wanted to assume that your player is going to play each of the games for exactly 100000 frames, then calculate the average framerate during their session. I'll leave the calculations up to you if you want to try it out for yourself, but the short of it is, you're looking for, you guessed it, the harmonic mean of the per-game FPS scores!  You'll get the correct answer to the question you posed, but why was that even a question in the first place? Why would you want to treat every frame as equally important, regardless of how long you're looking at it?",hardware,2025-11-19 09:35:20,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6817284), 'word': '3D', 'start': 564, 'end': 566}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9136284), 'word': 'F', 'start': 1600, 'end': 1601}]",Tópico 1

AMD,npownpk,"Well, why do people care about a game's average FPS in the first place? The two main reasons that I hear are that higher FPS mean greater smoothness and better responsiveness. Both smoothness and responsiveness are related to frame times, and FPS is the inverse of the arithmetic mean of frame times. So, people care about average FPS for a game because it gives an easily digestible number that communicates something about smoothness and responsiveness. If those are the metrics that people care about in the first place, then harmonic mean of FPS gives you the arithmetic mean of the frame times across the variety of games tested, so you get a better representation of the thing that gamers care about across those games.  If you want to say that FPS averages shouldn't be expected to correspond to anything real anyway, and they just give a way to measure relative strength between cards, that's fine. But arithmetic mean is just as good at doing that as geometric mean. The reason that many reviewers switched to geometric mean instead of arithmetic mean in the first place was because they felt that it was a better representation of performance.

I don't know that Thermalright is doing it, but I don't know that they aren't either.   Beyond this, if you pay $130 for a Noctua NH-D15 (the cheapest variant currently), you can buy a Thermalright Dual tower 3-4 times. Or a Dual Tower, a 360mm AIO, and another dual tower.

AMD,npim6wy,"It also depends on the game, but in general, DLSS is at least as good as FSR, but usually, it gives a better image quality.  That said, it seems that the difference between DLSS 4 and FSR 4 is not as big, so AMD is slowly catching up.  But the FSR 4 version is barely available yet we can not see the future for now.  Likely RTX card still has a slight advantage in ray tracing performance, but again, the gap is not that big.  RTX 5060 TI is likely slightly stronger in raster/pure performance but the 9060XT is a better value for dollar IF you only care about raster performance and do not use ray tracing.  NVIDIA is usually better at encoding and some other stuff if you do streaming and so on, but if you don't, you are paying some extra for that as well.    Now the question is how much extra you need to pay for the 5060TI over AMD, price difference likely also depends on the country you live in.  And I would not choose the 8GB version in any recent card, both Ray tracing and even Frame generation tools also increase VRAM usage. So an 8GB card often can not even use those features.  Borderlands 4 on all low 1080p is already close to 8GB VRAM.  If you want to max Resident Evil 4 from early 2023 with ray tracing on, including 8GB textures, you already above 10GB VRAM at 1080p.

AMD,npkyjac,"I'm surprised that I haven't seen 2.5 things mentioned in the discussion thus far.   First, the PS5 Pro being likely to drive development. Even if you don't care about consoles, the PS5 Pro pushing FSR 4.0 support could be massive for day one FSR 4.0 support especially in titles focusing on cross-platform development.   Second: DLSS is a general model while FSR 4.0 is game specific.  Two-point-fifth: Even if FSR 4.0 does achieve better adaption, DLSS may still be easy enough to integrate into cross-platform releases as it's a general model. That said, given that it's a general model perhaps FSR 4.0 continues to go this ""game-specific"" model path instead of ""general model"" and give developers more game-specific control over the FSR 4.0 model. Albeit, that could end up as more of a drawback especially for more indie titles.   I don't think you're going to need to worry about it any time soon and it's something that we've really had no indication of seeing,.. but if such models *expand* beyond simple frame sharpening and generation & into experimental generative, I'd expect FSR's positioning in console adaption to potentially give whichever model dominates console a massive edge? For instance, how long will it be before we see game-specific trained generative FSR models replace things with unique, AI generated assets. Example: using generative model to create 360 sprites derived from an extremely high poly models to populate many variants of stumps in a drab forest, without ever needing more than a flat plane. If that's a feature which ever becomes feasible, that's where I'd watch for FSR's game-specific models & their positioning on consoles to possibly surge ahead (as you wouldn't want to train two of these, just one).

Unlike DLSS, a lot of other effects and techniques that a modern game uses, like AO or DoF, often run at 1/4 resolution without the ability to set it to native, so, if anything - it's those things to blame for ""making the image not native"".  >I get what you're saying that it supports native because you can output to native.  No, I was saying that it suports native resolution as **input**. Say, if you set DLSS performance/quality preset to ""Quality"" on game set to FHD, the game renders at HD, DLSS upscales it, and outputs at FHD. However, if you select DLSS ""DLAA"" mode, or ""Native"" mode, or set resolution slider to 100% - the game will render at native resolution to begin with. Nvidia most often refers to native mode as ""DLAA"", while AMD and Intel refer to their respective FSR and XeSS modes as ""Native AA""; as long as input and output resolutions match, the game is rendered at native, that's it. Quite often DLSS at native looks better than other native AA options, definitely less blurry (well, DLSS 4 presets have visual issues in DLAA mode, but that's a different topic).  >If speaking about anti-aliasing and enabling it then referring to not using it as natively seeing it.  If you refer to ""native"" as in ""what game offers out of the box"", then DLSS also falls under ""native"". I mean, it's one of AA options, developers had to implement it in their game to make it work. If the game offers, say, TAAU, TSR, DLSS, and FSR - I don't see how one of the options can be considered ""native to the game"" and some other not, since all of them is what the game has. Same as, say, texture quality settings, or draw distance settings. But within the context of AA/upscaling, ""native"" most often refers to input resolution.  >I see native as the stock settings on the game regardless of levels you choose  But which settings are the ""stock"" settings? Quite often the games don't offer ""stock"" settings, but they offer a range of settings' presets, like ""medium"" and ""high"". Moreover, a lot of games also auto-select settings depending on your hardware. Both the presets and auto-selection may set AA/upscaling to DLSS, and the funniest thing - I've never seen DLSS resolution being set to ""Native"" or ""DLAA"" via settings presets or auto-selection of settings, it was always ""Quality"" or lower. So, from this point of view, using ""stock"" settings or presets actually makes the rendering sub-native.",buildapc,2025-11-19 12:09:18,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.74622667), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 25, 'end': 27}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8488288), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 120, 'end': 122}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87667286), 'word': 'A', 'start': 194, 'end': 195}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.43493718), 'word': 'Do', 'start': 200, 'end': 202}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.79848754), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 521, 'end': 523}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8587756), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 606, 'end': 608}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.879894), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 610, 'end': 614}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47274178), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 677, 'end': 679}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8262811), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 799, 'end': 805}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.975094), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 856, 'end': 859}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99810237), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 864, 'end': 869}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.61739683), 'word': 'FSR', 'start': 896, 'end': 899}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6152389), 'word': 'Native AA', 'start': 919, 'end': 928}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6747531), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1033, 'end': 1037}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49215212), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1121, 'end': 1123}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.33126092), 'word': 'DL', 'start': 1158, 'end': 1160}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.83623743), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1376, 'end': 1380}]",Tópico 5

AMD,npsbmej,"Since you have an RX 7700 XT, the AMD Adrenalin software is the prime suspect. It has features that override in-game settings, often enabling themselves during ""Gaming"" profile setups.  1. Radeon Chill: This feature dynamically lowers FPS to save power when user input is low, often capping it at weird intervals (like 75).    * Open AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition.    * Go to Gaming -> Graphics (Global Graphics).    * Ensure Radeon Chill is Disabled.    * *Note:* Also check the specific profiles for Overwatch 2 or Palworld in the ""Games"" tab, as they can have custom overrides. 2. Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC): Check if this is enabled and set to a specific limit in the Global Graphics settings. 3. Radeon Enhanced Sync: If you have V-Sync off in-game but ""Enhanced Sync"" on in drivers, it can sometimes cause stuttering if the monitor's refresh rate isn't perfectly matched. Try turning this Off for testing. 4. Wait for Vertical Refresh: Set this to ""Always Off"" globally to ensure the driver isn't forcing V-Sync even when the game requests it off.  You mentioned a Gigabyte B650 motherboard. If you installed the Gigabyte Control Center (GCC), it is a known cause of stuttering and performance caps.  * The Issue: GCC often tries to manage fan curves, RGB, and *performance profiles* automatically. It can conflict with AMD Adrenalin. * The Fix: If installed, completely uninstall Gigabyte Control Center. It is not necessary for the PC to function (you can set fan curves in BIOS). * Check Background Apps: Look for ""App Center"" or any other Gigabyte utilities in your system tray and close them.",buildapc,2025-11-20 03:35:12,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9520108), 'word': 'R', 'start': 18, 'end': 19}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93309397), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 34, 'end': 36}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.92056733), 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 38, 'end': 40}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.44449493), 'word': '##lin', 'start': 44, 'end': 47}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9022489), 'word': 'Gaming', 'start': 161, 'end': 167}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4960782), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 189, 'end': 191}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6499938), 'word': 'Chi', 'start': 196, 'end': 199}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5935722), 'word': 'Software', 'start': 338, 'end': 346}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7454046), 'word': 'Gaming', 'start': 378, 'end': 384}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.68257165), 'word': 'Graphics', 'start': 405, 'end': 413}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.85198843), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 428, 'end': 430}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7473671), 'word': 'Chi', 'start': 435, 'end': 438}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.762345), 'word': 'Overwatch 2', 'start': 504, 'end': 515}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5077537), 'word': 'Pal', 'start': 519, 'end': 522}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67071253), 'word': '##world', 'start': 522, 'end': 527}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82992023), 'word': 'Games', 'start': 536, 'end': 541}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8391455), 'word': 'Global Graphics', 'start': 680, 'end': 695}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6012368), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 709, 'end': 711}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75596035), 'word': 'S', 'start': 745, 'end': 746}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.554206), 'word': 'Giga', 'start': 1079, 'end': 1083}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7565298), 'word': 'B', 'start': 1088, 'end': 1089}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66580176), 'word': 'Gigaby', 'start': 1127, 'end': 1133}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5803921), 'word': 'Control Center', 'start': 1136, 'end': 1150}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6542744), 'word': 'G', 'start': 1152, 'end': 1153}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9550673), 'word': 'G', 'start': 1228, 'end': 1229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71784604), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1334, 'end': 1336}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7162734), 'word': 'Ad', 'start': 1338, 'end': 1340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95273167), 'word': 'G', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1396}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.3507536), 'word': '##iga', 'start': 1396, 'end': 1399}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.79345155), 'word': 'Control Center', 'start': 1404, 'end': 1418}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nppax8t,"Making chips is extremely difficult. Despite electronics getting more and more popular over last 3 decades, there have been a lot of companies failing, or companies ditching their semiconductor divisions, and chip manufacturing especially has been hit the hardest. The last victim of this was Intel and Samsung. Intel has problems with their manufacturing which is why they are lagging behind TSMC now in their chips, and Samsung is unable to produce DRAM as cheaply as SK Hynix, which is the reason for their huge value decrease.  It seems like AI actually breathed some life into the industry, and is subsidising consumer markets, which is why we have seen bigger improvements than expected for 50xx series of graphic cards. Despite the fact that people think 50xx series of cards have been a disappointment, the larger volume of chips has allowed for more money to be invested in the research and mass manufacturing, which made them faster and cheaper than the predictions were.  The truth is that due to the nature of memory and bandwidth being space inefficient, the only way to increase those now is to just make them physically bigger, which influences the cost A LOT, which is why we have seen less memory on cards from both AMD and Nvidia, despite the fact that their speed increased proportionally more than memory.  The worst part is that there does not seem to be any research breakthroughs in the next decade that would allow to make those cheaper, which means 32 GB of VRAM might become the upper limit for consumer grade cards for at least next decade.",pcmasterrace,2025-11-19 17:42:15,-37,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9991841), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 293, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99883837), 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 303, 'end': 310}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99907327), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 312, 'end': 317}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9310756), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 393, 'end': 397}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9987205), 'word': 'Samsung', 'start': 422, 'end': 429}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9958744), 'word': 'SK Hynix', 'start': 470, 'end': 478}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60421854), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 546, 'end': 548}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95615184), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1233, 'end': 1236}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81463104), 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 1241, 'end': 1247}]",Tópico 3

Forget the specifics of whether it's GDDR7 or HBM, this is just an example. You can either make it into 6 x Consumer Tier cards, or 1 x AI DC based cards.   If you make it into a consumer based card, you might make 6 x $500 profit, or $3k. If you make 1 x DC based card, you might make $15k. Sounds like a dead easy choice, right? Not always.   If they expect this to be a very short bubble, they don't want to lose the market share from the consumer, because it can be hard to get it back. So they usually just let the opportunity go.    However, if their competitor has the same supply side problems, then they feel safer in losing the consumer, because where will they go? Everyone just puts off buying a generation, they don't all flock to AMD/Intel because they have the same supply issues.   Even if AMD/Intel don't have that impairment, for the difference in profit, they'll set aside some of it to ""buy back"" the business. I.e instead of delivering the whole $15k profit from the DC card to shareholders, they reserve say. $3k per  card. Once the shortage is over, they produce the next generation, and subsidise the consumer card so that it's very low margin, then go on a PR campaign to hype ""Nvidia is back - this game changing card is just $xxxx (sold on tiny margins using the stored up profit).

AMD,nppfaba,"AI isnt breathing life into the industry, its stucking it out.   And the memory manufacturers kind of know its a bubble thats starting to burst already, so while AI gobbles up more and more memory production, so much that it outstrips production and leads to raised prices for gaming GPU VRAM and DDR5 RAM, they are hesitant to increase production, because the second the bubble bursts they will sit there with three extra factories and nobody to sell memory to.   And even on GPUs specifically, AI has caused stagnation. Nvidia xx90 cards still improve from one generation to the next, but the difference between 40 and 50 series is just raw bulk, hence the 12VHPWR connector catching fire so much. Below xx90 cards performance has stagnated in raster performance and only increased in RT and Tensor cores, the latter running DLSS and framegen, and so has memory, more or less since the 30 series. Its why xx60 cards seem eternally stuck on 8GB. Featuresets overall dont seem to really improve in that many useful ways. DLSS is great, 1x framegen I can see for higher refresh rate displays if you reach 60fps base, but already disliked for the latency increase, and then multi-framegen just takes that and makes it so much worse. Really all it does now is inflate numbers for marketing purposes.  Its happening on AMDs end, too, though they innovate the featureset in some good ways, like FSR 4 catching up to DLSS in image quality at least, but in terms of performance its not a huge uplift either.   All because for Nvidia the gaming market has lost most of its importance, so they dont really bother, and if Nvidia doesnt improve much, then neither does AMD.

DDR5 launch spec were slower than DDR4 because of similar or just a little bitter speeds but loose timings. And DDR6 might come with a similar problem as well.  I’m totally in for Zen7 being released for both AM5 & AM6, not just to make AM5 last longer but to give consumers the option, especially that going AM6 will be expensive for early adopters making Zen7 adoption slow if it was AM6 exclusive.  As for AM6, I really really hope it comes with extra PCIe lanes, like 4-8 lanes, I would hope for 12-16 but it not realistic unless they limit those 12-16 lanes to high end chipsets only (the E series) and can target workstation/server grade motherboards too. Currently AM5 high end, server & workstation grade motherboards are boring because of this, and the only way to get more PCIe lanes is to jump to Threadripper which is a very big jump considering how much more expensive it became compared to first generation Threadripper.",AMD,2025-11-12 13:28:18,5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8766886), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 22, 'end': 26}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9805176), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 87, 'end': 90}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76827276), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 141, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8970592), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 148, 'end': 150}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.53693306), 'word': '##6', 'start': 151, 'end': 152}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9846577), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 190, 'end': 192}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.93045944), 'word': 'DD', 'start': 223, 'end': 225}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8154477), 'word': 'DDR', 'start': 257, 'end': 260}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75023794), 'word': 'DDR6', 'start': 335, 'end': 339}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9037739), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 403, 'end': 407}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.918123), 'word': 'Zen7', 'start': 580, 'end': 584}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6317048), 'word': 'E', 'start': 817, 'end': 818}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.43840832), 'word': 'T', 'start': 1031, 'end': 1032}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60665923), 'word': '##rip', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1040}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.56100273), 'word': 'T', 'start': 1144, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.41042143), 'word': '##rip', 'start': 1150, 'end': 1153}]",Tópico 1

AMD,noisgw3,">I also think AM6 will be when DDR6 is ready.  I agree. That'd line up with how AMD's been doing things since the AM2 days.  >Might be they release a AM5+ with PCIe6 and more USB4  Given what they've been doing since Ryzen 3000 series, i think i'd be more likely that they do it as a chipset thing, a la 500 series chipsets supporting PCIe 4.0 on AM4. You could use Zen 5000 series chips on 300 series chipsets with the appropiate BIOS version, in some cases, you'd also lose support for older parts, and the newer CPU may become limited to the PCIe version of the Motherboard (3000 or newer CPUs being limited to PCIe 3.0 on 400 or older boards)   AM5 may go a simillar route, the upgrade path is one of the things that are attractive about AMD so I don't think they'll revise the socket until DDR6 is a thing, and they move onto AM6.

AMD,norjsvf,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",AMD,2025-11-14 05:48:36,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.86930275), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 100, 'end': 102}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.78668326), 'word': 'Ch', 'start': 371, 'end': 373}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9945775), 'word': 'Edge', 'start': 416, 'end': 420}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6136532), 'word': 'Ch', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1024}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.68942505), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1070, 'end': 1073}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9185944), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1134}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9277409), 'word': 'Firefox', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1249}]",Tópico 5

AMD,npltnvb,"Well this will likely use the INT8 version of FSR4 on older RDNA GPUs. The only reason AMD is not bringing FSR 4 to older rdna GPUs is because they lack FP8 suppprt that RDNA 4 has. The FP8 units are very important for ML based upscalars that DLSS and now FSR 4 use.   Thats the reason older FSR versions which used INT8 worked on a lot of older GPUs as they all already had INT8.  The INT8 Version of FSR 4 is better than the FSR 3.1 but not as good as the FP8 version.

If more people used Linux to cheat and it affected the game, they'd immediately block it. Which it will become an issue if more people play on Linux. This is doubly so if the game is cross play with consoles.   Plus the steam machine needs to cost around the same as a PS5 given it's performance. Valve have indicated it will cost the same as a entry level gaming pc which is much more.   The deck had the novelty of being the first handheld pc that did it right and was priced right. The steam machine doesn't have that luxury. The amount of people buying it for it's OS are tiny, it's cheaper to install bazzite on a PC. Most people think their deck just runs ""steam"" not Linux. Plus the console market this is aimed at won't be able to play the console bread and butter like FIFA, CoD, Fortnite and more. It's all about the price whether it succeeds or not. If it costs 800-1000 you'd be better getting a pc that you can at least upgrade or a PS5 pro if you lean more console as that can play the aforementioned games.

Welcome to corporate politics where a PR dept. that always and solely operates in ""damage control mode"" plays stupid games and consumers ""win"" collateral damage as a prize.  If AMD was smart or forward-thinking regarding brand recognition and customer reception, they'd just fully release or open-source the INT8 version of FSR4 and make it available as a vendor-agnostic, ""experimental"" ""FSR4-lite"".

I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.598958), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166454), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933385), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176113), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867158), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694113), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.65421814), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523964), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5150183), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546408), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089722), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235836), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 2

The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.
