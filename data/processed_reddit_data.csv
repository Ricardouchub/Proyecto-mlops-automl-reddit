There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",hardware,2025-07-04 02:03:25,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90186936, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 214, 'end': 217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86568034, 'word': 'N', 'start': 863, 'end': 864}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.62983924, 'word': 'Pascal', 'start': 888, 'end': 894}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5193365, 'word': 'Titan', 'start': 1013, 'end': 1018}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7143878, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1344, 'end': 1350}]",Tópico 1

I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support).

Intel,mt4vsoz,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,11,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87045366, 'word': 'A', 'start': 9, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8757272, 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 492, 'end': 501}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4702369, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 580, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9827648, 'word': 'LL', 'start': 666, 'end': 668}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.75775045, 'word': 'Flash Attention', 'start': 892, 'end': 907}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99654156, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 911, 'end': 916}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9984048, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7069878, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1250, 'end': 1251}]",Tópico 1

Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Intel,n4j4ewg,"Driver support in games is very good these days, I have had considerably more issues on my NVIDIA PC than on my arc PC, over the last six months or so (I've also used that one more but still felt like a worse overall experience in terms of gaming drivers). Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",buildapc,2025-07-22 14:26:29,5,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.40689486, 'word': 'N', 'start': 91, 'end': 92}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.66853505, 'word': '##VI', 'start': 92, 'end': 94}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.64355624, 'word': '##DI', 'start': 94, 'end': 96}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87526065, 'word': 'Adobe Photoshop', 'start': 351, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9673004, 'word': 'After Effects', 'start': 390, 'end': 403}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97547114, 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 427, 'end': 430}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8766316, 'word': 'XESS 2', 'start': 433, 'end': 439}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6037617, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 538, 'end': 542}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6383771, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 757, 'end': 760}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7866408, 'word': 'N', 'start': 765, 'end': 766}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.41666016, 'word': '##VI', 'start': 766, 'end': 768}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6164392, 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 768, 'end': 771}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8475369, 'word': 'R', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.40597844, 'word': '##D', 'start': 872, 'end': 873}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8440125, 'word': '##NA 4', 'start': 873, 'end': 877}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90254444, 'word': 'Blackwell', 'start': 882, 'end': 891}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7276044, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1311, 'end': 1317}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9284942, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1322, 'end': 1325}]",Tópico 1

Intel,n6ses8s,"Honestly? If I were you I’d get a 9060xt 16gb for 350-370 and then enjoy your $400 saved.  Reason being that with your setup, once you start moving up in GPU, you’re not gonna see as big of a performance uplift because of your 5700x, which will start to slightly but noticeably bottleneck a 9070/5070 or above  Which if you did go with a 9070/5070, say you get one for $600, you’d need a new PSU, which is around $70-$100. And at that point, it’s not worth paying $300 extra for a 25-30% performance uplift at 1440p because thats a 50-60% price increase.  You could upgrade your CPU sure, but then at that point, with a new CPU/RAM/MOBO/GPU and Power Supply, that’s basically just building a whole new PC, and you’re not gonna be able to do that for under $800, nor should you because again, the price increase isn’t worth the performance increase.  If I were in your shoes, I’d get the 9060xt 16gb and ride out the rest of my PC for 4-5 more years playing at 1440p. After that, if Im unsatisfied with the performance and frames im getting in games, I’d sell it/keep it as a spare and start from scratch a brand new build ground up.

Intel,ndc08oa,"So this is the Intel Arc B50. It's an *extremely* power limited BMG-G21 with only 16 Xe2 cores (B580 has 20) and only a 128 bit memory bus, limiting memory performance to just 224 GB/s: B580 has 456 GB/s.  To get power down to 70 watts and be slot powered, it has utterly castrated the BMG-G21. Only 4 MB L2 cache is enabled (of the 18 MB on the silicon) and it runs 1,000 MHz slower than it does in B580. Some sources claim 8 MB L2 is enabled, so this appears to be a bit unsure at the moment. It's not remotely B580's 18 MB and Intel's dGPU caching architecture is still a train wreck from its IGP origins.  What Intel has done is given it a similar memory config to AMD's 7600XT, 128 bit GDDR6 and 16 GB of it and cut the BMG-G21 down so far it can barely do anything. It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.

Engineering and architecture workstations are about rasterisation performance. The designs and drawings have to be rendered quickly and smoothly on your two 4K monitors, which a stripped back and power-throttled 70 watt BMG-G21 isn't going to do.  For very entry level visualisation, we use RX 7600XTs with 16 GB, they have AutoDesk and Bentley certified drivers and enough VRAM and rasterisation to handle it. The RTX 4060 Ti isn't that bad there either, again you need the 16 GB version. On the next refresh of the low end workstations, they're probably going to end up being 9060XT and 5060Tis. Both of those would smash this little thing silly.  To that, I'm not sure who Intel wants to sell this to. $350 isn't serious money and it's competing with gaming-intended GPUs (which are utterly fine for visualisation and design) of much higher performance. It doesn't have substantially more RAM than competing products, it doesn't ECC protect the RAM and workstations generally don't care for slot powered cards either way. The ones we use come as standard with 800 watt PSUs and our choice of ""gaming"" CPUs like Ryzens or Cores, or Threadrippers and Xeons - Xeons are a bit less popular these days.

Compatibility is pretty decent but it’s hard to tell under gaming since there’s no GPU drivers for anything but embedded ARM graphics.  Under Linux, it’s a totally different story. You have Box64 and FEX-EMU. I switched to all ARM years ago but it came with a learning curve. Compared to three years ago, there’s many high performance games and performance reaches about 50-70% of native x86 performance.  If you wanna see some games running on ARM you can check out some videos I made almost 3 years ago below.

You have to manage everything else first, especially GPU... if you have a weak graphics card, it doesn't matter if you have 32gb or 64gb of RAM... you'll be limited by the GPU before you run in RAM issues.  Depending on your monitor resolution, and resolution you play at.... 'maxed out settings' is going to be all relative. For example if you have 1440P monitor, if you get a 5060ti/9060XT tier card.... you're not going to be playing maxed out settings without help of upscaler (DLSS or  FSR4).. 16 or 32gb RAM becomes irrelevant.

The 5070 will requires PSU upgrade, but others may not. 5070 comes w/ game code but limited to who you can sell to if you don't need it. Might be able recoup some money though as plenty of people who bought before promotion. w/ that in mind.. if you can get say $40ish for the game code.. the 5070 is better buy over the 4060ti. If you don't want to spend that much then it's a tossup between 9060XT and 5060ti. The 5060ti is about 5% better raw performance wise but does have a more widely supported DLSS software stack which at that caliber of card you are more likely to use.....so to you it may or may not be worth the extra $70.... if not and you really don't want to spend as much then 9060XT @ $350 is better value card in that budget.  If you prefer Nvidia card, then 5070 is overall better value card as it is 30-40% faster than 5060ti and why I'd pick it over the 5060ti if one can budget for it. Difference in performance is too big.  I'm not even bringing up (since someone else will) the AMD 9070 and 9070XT because they're well over MSRP and out of your budget and not worth it at the prices they sell at.... and at those inflated prices, you might as well move to 5070 ti (which is well over your budget as well).",pcmasterrace,2025-09-10 03:41:20,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6702995, 'word': 'PS', 'start': 764, 'end': 766}]",Tópico 1

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,23,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96047413, 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97551155, 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.47393385, 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9978709, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9221623, 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9936434, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.70016813, 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.99374455, 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97952205, 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.996042, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9800243, 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9670311, 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9871013, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9752412, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9922133, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6682615, 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99653184, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86584127, 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.64568275, 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90114915, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87513644, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8040758, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7500115, 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8380654, 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8164692, 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.88147104, 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9793236, 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9005273, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.69748294, 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.58866495, 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.511351, 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99225956, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.80401796, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7076516, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88741785, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5076931, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7363588, 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9888704, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99029034, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,67,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.98579425, 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6807291, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.53338933, 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8288868, 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8976541, 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87239146, 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87449735, 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.52110374, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.63087755, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9507805, 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5053189, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8337852, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69437224, 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5678201, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6214103, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6280626, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 1

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone.

Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",AMD,2024-04-03 08:42:33,9,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98876595, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 226, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8690469, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 266, 'end': 269}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9643116, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 419, 'end': 422}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.97362816, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 492, 'end': 495}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.59755176, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 726, 'end': 729}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.99718016, 'word': 'DirectX 12', 'start': 879, 'end': 889}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.62031287, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1402, 'end': 1404}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91604114, 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1466}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.995836, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.67432916, 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7718556, 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98041874, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7891968, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.56808084, 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6224168, 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9943219, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.997389, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.62152374, 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99866533, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86834437, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9983454, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8277303, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99850535, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7415536, 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88934016, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99857795, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.72743416, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.991135, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9856181, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99898607, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9676909, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99495494, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9952302, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6811376, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7200327, 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99592286, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7515257, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5172002, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9934948, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.50736785, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 1

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.

More often than not any system issues im having end up being the fault of Microsoft, or a specific game wasnt tested on AMD properly and the blame lies with the devs.",AMD,2024-04-01 20:48:17,3,Negative,Surprise,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92542624, 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 29, 'end': 33}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8244546, 'word': 'EV', 'start': 133, 'end': 135}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.978301, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 165, 'end': 168}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.57068884, 'word': 'R', 'start': 202, 'end': 203}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98619413, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 299, 'end': 302}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9922058, 'word': 'D', 'start': 389, 'end': 390}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.53306735, 'word': 'Na', 'start': 496, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.54683864, 'word': 'R', 'start': 501, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.45491752, 'word': '##NA', 'start': 503, 'end': 505}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9972282, 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 633, 'end': 640}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9787724, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 698, 'end': 701}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9960812, 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 888, 'end': 897}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9796407, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 934, 'end': 937}]",Tópico 1

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.949649, 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91378605, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7303601, 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975333, 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84053415, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6853485, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 1

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9945433, 'word': 'Nintendo', 'start': 23, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7072387, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 104, 'end': 108}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.736587, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 145, 'end': 149}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9411086, 'word': 'N', 'start': 262, 'end': 263}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99181014, 'word': 'C', 'start': 334, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7018669, 'word': '##UDA', 'start': 335, 'end': 338}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9394868, 'word': 'C', 'start': 595, 'end': 596}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.59285474, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 597, 'end': 599}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69475675, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 996, 'end': 999}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.93300354, 'word': 'PyTorch', 'start': 1181, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8076242, 'word': 'AL', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1397}]",Tópico 1

For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9452912, 'word': 'Lenovo', 'start': 223, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8261307, 'word': 'Hogwartz', 'start': 805, 'end': 813}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9086967, 'word': 'Rachet', 'start': 815, 'end': 821}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6654186, 'word': 'Clank', 'start': 826, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.72740483, 'word': 'Re', 'start': 833, 'end': 835}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8370989, 'word': '2', 'start': 841, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9770279, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1467}]",Tópico 1

What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

Intel,n0yywsv,"Different strategies. X3D has its place in time. X3D chips have to have another separate line to build and now test. No mobile X3D chips so far.   Silicon cost is greatly lowered if the design is the same and desktop/mobile chips can be binned to create separate product lines.    AMD I will argue absolutely needed to produce stellar products because of their past history before Zen 1. No one will defend AMD products before Zen 1.   I will definitely use a newer better AMD chip today but back then he'll no. There GPU line has driver issues and its why all of us just use NVIDIA gpus. There is a good reason.    Intel's new chip design strategy and leading edge fab is solid. The problem is foundry capital expenditure and foundry capacity. They have to build excess and train excess personal. The Ohio Silicon Heart Land. A whole new campus, town, new families, and Silicon ecosystem.    That takes time and a ton of money. And investment (aka the money levers) just dont want to pay for this. They rather get there money's worth of AI and self driving vehicles today. They know Chinese EV investment is bad and Chinese AI is bad. So rather than invest in Chinese companies and not make money, they want to use there leverage to pump up American companies.    This way American companies like Tesla and AI will succeed and win this AI race.   In other words, China ain't in the leading edge foundry game. None at all. No chance. So why pump money into that? They instead are attacking the EV and AI race. So our American companies will need capital to defend that space.   Intel design products are absolutely solid. 1000% they maintain better MT performance without SMT. SMT has security vulnerability.    Intel products are wafer Silicon efficient with p and E cores. Intel design is solid. Just foundry is extremely expensive and there isnt a China competitor. Taiwan is a very safe island.   If Taiwan was like a Hawaii, easily conquered, then for sure TSMC is at risk. But Taiwan today is like an island carrier/fortress. Too difficult to go against. At least not yet.

The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz. That's a huge clock speed deficit compared to the 5800XT and 5800X3D. When the 5800X3D first came out, it spanked the 5800X even though it was clocked 200MHz lower all-core (4500MHz vs 4300MHz).  But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron. For those on a budget, the 5800XT looks even more attractive because it has gone on sale for $125-150 and comes with a decent cooler.",hardware,2025-08-30 11:49:49,11,Neutral,Neutral,[],Tópico 1

AMD,nd367aj,"Non existent.  That was a thing about a decade ago.  First of all, Intel can still produce in different nodes.  Intel had the problem that they developed both architectures and process nodes together which both had advantages and disadvantages.  You can’t just switch out the process node for an architecture, every architecture is designed for some nodes specifications. The more you focus on one node the better you can use its advantages which is one of the reasons why Intel was typically superior with their chips. But that also comes with drawbacks like Intels 10nm issues.  Intel didn’t stay with basically Kaby lake for years because they wanted to but because they couldn’t switch to ice lake without the 10nm node. And that’s the reason why Intel fell back on the desktop and servers. If you look at their roadmaps, what became Tiger lake H was supposed to come out as Ice lake in like 2018. But with Rocket Lake they backported Ice lake to 14nm which worked more or less well, depending on who you ask. Since then, Intel developed their Architectures with no specific node in mind which makes them as flexible as any fabless company.   I’d say if anything it’s a huge advantage to have your own fabs today because you can determine how much volume you want for yourself.  TSMC is basically a monopoly at that point which also means that all three, NVIDIA, AMD and Intel compete over capacities and that drives up cost.  And then there is Apple.

For example, AMD has shown flexibility in the past, like when they re-lithographed Polaris (RX 580 → RX 590 on 12nm). Would that kind of move count as being “not node tied”? * And for Intel specifically, how should we think about this? Are their designs today still bound in ways that limit shifting across nodes, or is the tile-based approach (like with iGPU/cache tiles on Intel 3 vs. cores on 18A) essentially giving them AMD-like flexibility?

AMD,nc00dol,"The 5070 Super is rumoured to have 6% more cores, as well as 18GB GDDR7 and possibly a small clock speed bump. It should be reasonably powerful, probably matching the 9070 in raster. If that is the case, the 5070 Super could be a no-brained.  But I would guess that AMD will refresh the 9070 if Nvidia refreshes the 5070. It won't get a VRAM bump, but I could see them bumping the power limit up to the same wattage/CU as the 9070XT, which would be 266W. The 9070 is currently so power limited that simply pushing more power is a completely viable option for a refresh.  266W would enable AMD to bump the clock speeds by 300-400 Mhz, which would keep the 9070 firmly in contention with the 5070 Super, while costing AMD and their board partners nothing, since 9070s usually have 9070 XT coolers specced for 304W or higher, I think the Sapphire pulse 9070 is the only exception.

AMD,nc47tse,"Here's why Intel will never make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and why their situation is different to AMD/Radeon's.  1. Intel is basically an upstart in GPU, they have zero brand presence or mindshare to build off of. AMD on the other hand has Radeon which has been around for 20+ years. In fact the only thing gamers know about Intel's GPUs is their crappy Intel HD 3000 iGPUs that couldn't run games at playable frame rates. AMD doesn't have this issue.  2. Intel is slow to compete with NVIDIA. Look at Battlemage and how we're STILL waiting on the B770, it might not even release. People are not willing to wait for your product to release, if they want to upgrade, they will upgrade to what is available. AMD also doesn't have this issue, within a month or two, AMD was competing with Blackwell.  3. Intel had only bad press with ARC's initial launch, especially because of the drivers situation. Whilst Intel has tried to improve the drivers significantly and done a great job marketing Battlemage and the product even being solid, first impressions are hard to shake and had Alchemist had a better launch, Battlemage would have sold better. AMD doesn't really have this issue, they have for one or two gens but that was long ago and not anywhere close to the disastrous driver situation Intel's had. AMD drivers for the most part, might have a small issue in a few games on release, but they actually worked and were able to play games. Some games on Alchemist wouldn't even launch or run correctly.  4. Battlemage and Alchmeist doesn't compete across the stack. For what it's worth, only competing with basically the 4060 made Battlemage a sort of pointless generation because if you bought say an RTX 3060 years ago, it's not really an upgrade to buy a B580 or B570. Furthermore, if you have a 3070 or anything else, you literally cannot upgrade to a Battlemage card because it's a downgrade in performance. Competing across the whole stack is essential to getting sales and to convince people that your product is fast. This is probably the closest problem AMD has to Intel, but with RDNA3 they tried to compete across the whole stack, they just got destroyed.",hardware,2025-09-03 01:21:43,6,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99875855, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 11, 'end': 16}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92881143, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 43, 'end': 49}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9230656, 'word': 'AMD / Radeon', 'start': 104, 'end': 114}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9988977, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 122, 'end': 127}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69209313, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 155, 'end': 157}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9822433, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 220, 'end': 223}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98802376, 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 246, 'end': 248}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9198082, 'word': '##deon', 'start': 248, 'end': 252}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9979321, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 331, 'end': 336}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9693157, 'word': 'Intel HD 3000', 'start': 360, 'end': 373}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98913956, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 429, 'end': 432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9988581, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 462, 'end': 467}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9258038, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 492, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87792647, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 508, 'end': 518}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9917762, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 712, 'end': 715}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9859884, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 769, 'end': 772}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98962116, 'word': 'Blackwell', 'start': 792, 'end': 801}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9985354, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 807, 'end': 812}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9894731, 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 837, 'end': 840}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99805033, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 911, 'end': 916}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.73532736, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 995, 'end': 1005}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9354025, 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 1084, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.666829, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 1115, 'end': 1125}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9860314, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1150, 'end': 1153}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99793696, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1296, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8047997, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1309, 'end': 1312}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9218794, 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 1460, 'end': 1469}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8588118, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 1513, 'end': 1523}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.939614, 'word': 'Alchmei', 'start': 1528, 'end': 1535}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98893005, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 2080, 'end': 2085}]",Tópico 1

R&D money is great and all but only if you use it wisely as AMD has in CPU and they could replicate that same success in GPU, but they ignore GPU division pretty much entirely.  > If AMD cut RDNA4 prices to bare minimum, how would they afford the even larger budgets for future architectures like UDNA2, UDNA3, etc?  Well AMD is in a unique position because they have more than one product segment to fall back on. NVIDIA lives or dies by GPU, if the GPU they produce is utter garbage and GPUs fall out of favor in the wider market, their entire product portfolio is at risk and their future.

AMD,nd2nl3a,"Businesses who handle proprietary data sets and can't justify the costs of an entire server are using local machines, maybe that's a niche use case, but it's what I have experience with so that's what I drew on. I'll concede on that point, most LLMs are probably running on server hardware, not local.   I won't concede that 1/5 is a conservative estimate for DIY to prebuilt sales though. I'd say 1/10 is realistic if you look outside the US centric reddit hardware bubble. You have to remember that Internet cafes in Asia are extremely popular in densely populated cities where the average apartment doesn't have space for a gaming setup, and they buy prebuilts by the pallet. Maybe in the US it's 1/5, but the rest of the world is far more heavily skewed towards prebuilts.   The main point is I agree with you, AMD is never going to catch up with Nvidia in dGPU market share, anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, even in the main AMD sub this is the prevailing opinion. I would even go as far as to say AMD could make a 6090 killer next generation for $999, and their market share wouldn't increase by even a single point because there are so many consumers who mindlessly buy Nvidia or buy prebuilts/laptops which might as well be 100% Nvidia at this point.   Lowering prices did nothing for AMD in the past, and it won't change anything now. AMD will just change their wafer allocation to favor CPUs and still sell every GPU they make at current margins. Why bother when the Nvidia fans who cry for lower prices from AMD have shown time and time again that they will just wait for Nvidia to lower their prices before buying Nvidia like they always have? Lowering margin only hurts their R&D fund for the next generation.    The irony is that the real losers of this arrangement are GeForce fans, Nvidia has no incentive to produce outstanding gaming products when they're this far ahead. They can afford to lose a few generations and have their market share fall to a precipitous 90% before they start trying again, hell they can afford to lose the entire mid-range and budget markets permanently as long as they have their $2000 5090 marketing prop that only a fraction of people can afford.

Hiring a Linode instance or something like that for a couple hours or a week is way more cost effective than going out and buying a whole new set of hardware, especially just for experimenting and seeing if a LLM or AI model is feasible for their business or to prototype one they're making etc.  Or perhaps just outsourcing to another company on a subscription-based model with hundreds or thousands of clients who maybe tailor their LLM or AI model for certain clients and their data. I've had my cousin's law firm go out and get AI assistants and I suggested he setup an instance tailored to his firm. But the firm did some digging and found a local company who just has hundreds of AI assistants that they lease out on a subscription model and who tailor their AI assistants to a specific style of business and they customise it so it knows who the people are at the business, the business name, emails go to specific business accounts etc. It was a few thousand a year to use this AI assistant company, but the firm don't have to troubleshoot or maintain it and you get free included bi-annual performance upgrades for the hardware that's running the model, and obviously they update the model too and make tweaks after they do testing to see if they can deploy the model to their clients. In the end, it's just a secretarial replacement really, so all the model needs to do is basic stuff like note down the name and number, who the person wants to talk to and forward emails. Nothing too crazy or extensive. So maybe this is a basic scenario.  Either way, I don't think it's feasible to go out and buy bare metal hardware, especially for a small business.

Maybe in the US it's 1/5, but the rest of the world is far more heavily skewed towards prebuilts.  I mean most netcafes I know of in Asia don't buy pre-builts from an OEM like Dell or HP or something, most of them go to a local builder in one of those huge techmalls and puts in an order for 3-4 machine types/tiers but hundreds of units. i.e basic office, then basic gamer, then moderate gamer and then like high end gamer rigs. They put in an order of 1,000 PCs and they might buy 100 office PCs, 300 basic gamer ones, then 500 moderate gamer ones and then 100 high end gamer ones to have different tiers in their cafe. But they're all DIY rigs really, just from a local techmall shop who cranks them out and services/warranties them. I've never seen an asian netcafe buy an HP or Dell prebuilt in years and things like iBUYPOWER or Origin PC aren't really popular in Asia as the DIY prebuilt market is huge there and it's all local small shops vying for business. At least that's my experience from when I used to live in Taiwan. The last time I saw like a netcafe use prebuilts, like proper HP or Dell OEM ones was the early 2000s and it was usually smaller cafes that didn't really cater to gamers.  > The main point is I agree with you, AMD is never going to catch up with Nvidia in dGPU market share, anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, even in the main AMD sub this is the prevailing opinion.  I wouldn't say thats the prevailing opinion over there, maybe the slight majority, but a lot of them are still believing that it's 2008 and the only reason AMD is behind NVIDIA is because of some marketing campaign or behind doors deals, rather than AMD's own lack of prioritising dGPU.  > I would even go as far as to say AMD could make a 6090 killer next generation for $999, and their market share wouldn't increase by even a single point because there are so many consumers who mindlessly buy Nvidia or buy prebuilts/laptops which might as well be 100% Nvidia at this point.  I don't think so. I think they could make a 6090 killer for $999, the problem is will they supply enough to make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and considering how intent AMD is on using TSMC, I don't think that will happen. It all goes back to AMD insisting on using TSMC, they need to diversify their foundry and if they want to take marketshare it might mean going to Samsung for your dGPU gaming products and getting cheaper but lower performance silicon to undercut NVIDIA. It won't happen because AMD probably doesn't want to ruin their CPU dominance and their relationship with TSMC is too important, so they will continue with TSMC. But also because AMD is moving to UDNA for dGPU, which means they are pretty much forced to having a unified architecture on one node, which now limits their foundry options. If they choose a foundry ALL their graphics products have to use it and I very much doubt AMD wants their professional stuff nor their consoles to use Samsung or Intel foundry.  > The irony is that the real losers of this arrangement are GeForce fans, Nvidia has no incentive to produce outstanding gaming products when they're this far ahead.  Absolutely agree on that. But on the other hand, the NVIDIA fan doesn't have much of a choice anyway because they were always going to buy NVIDIA. The absolute losers in their scenario are the people like myself or maybe even you who move between Radeon and NVIDIA and just pick the best hardware option at the time. In the end, if Radeon's not willing to fight NVIDIA and make the best thing possible, then buying NVIDIA is the only real option consumers have because it's sadly the best product available.",hardware,2025-09-08 12:52:11,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97404206, 'word': 'Linode', 'start': 180, 'end': 186}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9029566, 'word': 'LLM', 'start': 380, 'end': 383}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.95504725, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 387, 'end': 389}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.82093227, 'word': 'LLM', 'start': 606, 'end': 609}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9137966, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 613, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97398734, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 703, 'end': 705}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9441565, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 857, 'end': 859}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.91455406, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 936, 'end': 938}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.92428607, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 1157, 'end': 1159}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6280302, 'word': 'Amazon', 'start': 1896, 'end': 1902}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91610944, 'word': 'Google', 'start': 1906, 'end': 1912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9862131, 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 1916, 'end': 1925}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.85193807, 'word': 'US', 'start': 2166, 'end': 2168}]",Tópico 1

AMD,ncddia3,"> I watched your video and at 18:30 they say that Microcenter had nearly 20x more RDNA4 cards on launch day than they did Blackwell, literally proving my point.  Firstly, that's one retailer in one region. It doesn't prove ANYTHING about whether more RDNA4 shipped than Blackwell. I mean we can just see from Steam HW survey and JPR numbers that NVIDIA shipped way more stock in both Q1 and Q2 than RDNA4. So whilst Microcenter may not have gotten them or even maybe NA was neglected by NVIDIA, NVIDIA still shipped more cards to people on the whole. Again... your whole point was AMD was somehow masterful by delaying their launch so they could build up stock, yet the numbers do not reflect your theory. In Europe for instance there was barely any stock as evidenced by that same video. So AMD only cared to divert stock to NA and made other regions suffer.  Secondly, I wrote a whole lot and you NEVER answered it. So I'll try again. My whole point was you were trying to say that RDNA4 was smart to delay its launch so it could stockpile units, correct? Except that you also then said that there was only 3 weeks left in the quarter so that's why the Q1 RDNA4 numbers were disappointing.  So what is it?:  1. That RDNA4 had high volume and was smart to delay so they could stockpile lots of stock?  2. Or was it that it was an anemic launch that doesn't reflect in Q1 numbers because there was only three weeks left in Q1?  Choose.  > The fake MSRP is easily explained by AMD lying.  Thanks for admitting AMD lied. Appreciate it.  >  a 9070XT GPU die manufacturing cost is closer in price to a 5080 than it is a 5070. Aggressive pricing on the 5070 had them delay release and ""cut"" the price to $599. Launch cards then launched for the price they were always planning to launch for.  AMD simply made out like the MSRP was $599 by giving AIBs grants/kickbacks/allowances (whatever you want to call it) for selling a cheaper model at that MSRP on launch day for a limited run of units.  Regardless, this is all one big distraction. I still need you to answer the above question. Please answer it.  > Your own source claims Microcenter had 11,600 RDNA4 cards on launch day and 500 Blackwell cards on launch day.  Again, one retailer in one region. In other regions like China there were floods of Blackwell on launch day, entire warehouses stacked. By contrast AMD had little stock in Europe for RDNA4.  > And according to your own video, that's more cards at one retailer than Microcenter had 5090s and 5080s combined at every one of their stores combined.

A ""\~25% fabric traffic reduction"" in gaming tests isn't a free +25% to external bandwidth, and it doesn't erase a \~40% raw GB/s gap. Even if we assume AMD just matched or let's even go as far as to say \~10% better than Nvidia's compression, they'd still be well behind on effective bandwidth.  The simpler explanation for those results is that the tested scenarios aren't that bandwidth-bound. Once bandwidth clears a threshold, other limits (shader/geometry/queues, cache behavior, drivers) dominate. So ""RDNA4 compression makes GDDR6 keep up with GDDR7"" overstates the feature by a lot.",hardware,2025-08-26 21:04:21,19,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9762815, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 48, 'end': 51}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99580395, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 69, 'end': 72}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6024931, 'word': 'G', 'start': 75, 'end': 76}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9844132, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 90, 'end': 96}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5206669, 'word': 'G', 'start': 99, 'end': 100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.948584, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 142, 'end': 148}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98919153, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 237, 'end': 243}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9947964, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 279, 'end': 282}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9851035, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 448, 'end': 451}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9853847, 'word': 'Nvidia', 'start': 517, 'end': 523}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8916782, 'word': 'R', 'start': 804, 'end': 805}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7751789, 'word': 'G', 'start': 828, 'end': 829}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.86172396, 'word': 'G', 'start': 847, 'end': 848}]",Tópico 1

AMD,naxro34,"Kepler\_L2 said L0 and L1 is merged in CDNA4. Maybe RDNA 5 goes even further and merges all CU level caches (including VRF) into one big shared flexible cache like Apple did with M3 and A17 Pro.   Like you said it's about SRAM scaling being bad and minimizing SRAM investment. N3P = no scaling, N5 poor scaling vs N7.      NVIDIA definitely has the advantage here while AMD's cache system is overly complicated and inflexible. The next logical step is to make caches into one big shared block that can be dynamically allocated for different purposes.   L1 will be much more important with the new WGS and ADC scheduling and dispatch within each SE. No more global scheduling only work item preparation and load balancing. This and other methods could explain why L2 will be less important and less used allowing AMD to use 24MB L2 on AT2 (According to MLID and Kepler\_L2 rumours).   Actually the rumour for AT2 is +25% CUs and -25% PHY width vs 9070XT, so perhaps AMD has some novel and forward looking memory saving technology in UDNA. AT2 on paper could easily be stronger than 4090 in raster and that's wild with 24MB L2 and such a weak memory subsystem.

My idle temp for GPU is 37 and it won't go past 38 while watching a tv show via file streaming or DVD playback. So undervolt use a few programs to monitor your temps while playing a game for CPU and GPU. Make sure they stay below 80 c. I can keep my CPU and GPU at 70 c or below while gaming at 4k. It took a lot of hard work and tweaking to get to that point. It wasn't a one day thing. I am still tweaking for optimal performance and temps. I want my PC to last at least 5 years before I upgrade. Use MSI after burner and do a performance overlay that will display while gaming to get real time data under load.

AMD,nde04n0,"1. I would lean towards 9900x, I don't use Fusion, but I do Solidworks, SW is not very multi-threaded at all, unless for specific case, like flow works, solidCAM etc. If I were to build a tanky workstation right now (with company budget), I would probably go 9950x3d or 9950x (I run my CAD in VM and my workstation also acts as a server backup for my main server). Probably save the x3D premium for other hardware, so 9950x or 9900x.   2. Because of ITX, I would also go for AMD over Intel, it has a slightly (very slightly) lower need in peak thermal capacity. So you can get smaller cooler, smaller case. I think that in the day to day, I would not see too much difference in CAD work, but when you need to generate g code etc, or do (CPU) rendering, then the more cores the better.   3. If you are using company money, go for a Quadro or an equivalent Radeon Pro. There is nothing really wrong going with a gaming GPU, but for Solidworks, the preferred route is a professional graphic card, just for the sake of having no issue and getting support. So A2000 ada or A4000 ada will fit the bill.  This in turn reduce the thermal envelope you need for the GPU. But price is high on them... I know Fusion switch to DirectX... so you can get a gaming GPU and if you do play games on it.. then it's better, but if it's only for work, then quadro is the way I would go.   4. For the case, make sure you get the right thermal envelope need for the CPU, ITX can be very small, so after the CPU choice, you'll know if you need a AIO, a tower or a skinny heatsink.

Now I did change the RAM to a kit of 6000mts CL30 this is a better value kit and most AM5 CPUs dont like running above 6000mts anyways. I also switched the SSD to a more reliable and better quality one for a similar price.   I like the case and that's kinda a personal choice so if u son likes it then Id keep it.

AMD,ndc6w2e,"I use it to apply an undervolt and overclock to core clock speeds + a VRAM overclock. On top of that, I use it for the FSR 4 override in supported games (primarily in AC Shadows so far). Sometimes I use frame gen (Fluid Motion Frames 2.1) to get 100+fps if I have a base of at least 50-60fps.   For things that you can also do in GFE (I think), I also use sharpening in some cases when anti aliasing/TAA/upscaling results in an image that's a bit too blurry, Radeon Chill to limit FPS if there's no option in game or the in game option is buggy, and in some games I'll turn on Radeon Anti-Lag, which is similar to reflex.  To get the best use out of Radeon Enhanced Sync (with Free Sync), you should also be using the driver level frame limiter (assuming the in-game frame limiter doesn't have a slider/custom values) to set your max frame limit to a number under your monitor's refresh rate.

AMDs good upscaling (FSR 4) isn't supported on many games and you often have to use the older FSR 3 or 2 that look way worse. DLSS on the other hand has more games supporting it's newest version and older versions of it still look good.  The 9800X3D is noticeably better than the 7800X3D at 1080p (up to 30fps more) but the difference becomes less noticeable at higher resolutions (especially 4K). At 1440p the difference is gonna be like 20fps at max (probably less) and at 4K you won't notice it at all except for some games  So if upscaling matters to you get the 5070 Ti build. If you wanna play at 1080p (which you most likely don't with this system) the 9800X3D could be a big advantage.

You have to manage everything else first, especially GPU... if you have a weak graphics card, it doesn't matter if you have 32gb or 64gb of RAM... you'll be limited by the GPU before you run in RAM issues.  Depending on your monitor resolution, and resolution you play at.... 'maxed out settings' is going to be all relative. For example if you have 1440P monitor, if you get a 5060ti/9060XT tier card.... you're not going to be playing maxed out settings without help of upscaler (DLSS or  FSR4).. 16 or 32gb RAM becomes irrelevant.

The 5070 will requires PSU upgrade, but others may not. 5070 comes w/ game code but limited to who you can sell to if you don't need it. Might be able recoup some money though as plenty of people who bought before promotion. w/ that in mind.. if you can get say $40ish for the game code.. the 5070 is better buy over the 4060ti. If you don't want to spend that much then it's a tossup between 9060XT and 5060ti. The 5060ti is about 5% better raw performance wise but does have a more widely supported DLSS software stack which at that caliber of card you are more likely to use.....so to you it may or may not be worth the extra $70.... if not and you really don't want to spend as much then 9060XT @ $350 is better value card in that budget.  If you prefer Nvidia card, then 5070 is overall better value card as it is 30-40% faster than 5060ti and why I'd pick it over the 5060ti if one can budget for it. Difference in performance is too big.

It's not how it works... you always have to tune your settings to what the card/hardware is capable of. I still have to tune settings for my 5090 in lot of AAA games. At least you are being reasonable about adjusting your settings lol.  Same thing applies to amount of VRAM a card has.... same misconception exists, ESPECIALLY on this sub, that you need LOTS of VRAM and anything below 16gb VRAM on GPU is useless... again, that's wrong. Just because 5060ti/9060XT have 16gb VRAM doesn't mean you can crank up settings and  it's gonna be faster.... it could have 96gb VRAM, it's still going to be 30-40% slower than a 5070 w/ 12GB VRAM at it's intended resolution (1080p/1440p).  Yah would have been nice if 5070 had more VRAM but in no world is a 16gb XX60 class GPU ever going to be a faster gaming card than xx70 class. Period. Putting 16GB on weaker entry level cards was an FU homage from Nvidia and AMD to everyone raging about VRAM and people ate it right up.",pcmasterrace,2025-09-10 04:01:01,2,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5132414, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 825, 'end': 827}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9254727, 'word': 'Nvid', 'start': 1320, 'end': 1324}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.73472124, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1331, 'end': 1334}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.85171664, 'word': 'V', 'start': 1360, 'end': 1361}]",Tópico 1

AMD,nd7tqny,Vik. Do you think this small fix can be introduced on next drivers?   Using a 780m and a discrete GPU. On older drivers 780m gets recognized by Windows like power saving card and discrete like high performance one. But on newer drivers from some months ago power saving and high performance only show the discrete one. I have to specifically select the 780m if I want to use it.   I know this is just a registry change the driver installation does. But there is no manual info on how to fix it or change it.

If it's present on HDMI and display port (one guy fixed this by changing cable however and installing different driver), with mpo and without, then it will be same as checkerboard issue. There was no other fix than changing this angle thing in browser and disabling hw acceleration else where. But what's totally boggling here is why some doesn't have it, and some does. If that could be config-settings related, its gonna be close to impossible to fix. Checkerboard was present in all machines equipped with Nvidia GPU - this was common, but here.... It may be some driver-firmware of other hardware compatibility that appeared with system update. It may be SAM, ULPS, simply everything.    And with rDNA 2 (6800XT) i had one issue that appeared with later drivers and was never fixed - it was ULPS, but appeared only with display port and only on windows. My display was waking up just to get sleep in regular time periods. To fix this I had to disable ""enableu ULPS"" in registry after every driver update. Every single time. Problem is... Issue was present after swapping to RTX 3080. And there was no ULPS in registry.   After weeks of searching in free time, I found out, this was question of... Compatibility of monitor(display) firmware-system-driver and there is nothing I can do. I got experience with this kind of issues on clients systems, where display firmware is the culprit (usually it's displays from 2017-2020) with no new drivers since 2019 - 2021. After swapping back to 6800XT, seeing this again (but be able to workaround it), I was sure it will happen with my next GPU - 9070XT. But for some unknown reason it's not happening (!?).   So it started on 6800XT, ~ 3 months after purchase, I had no previous GPU (GTX1080ti - sold it), but borrowed old GTX 1060 from my brother setup (pascal gen required firmware update for display port - I applied it) - same here.

Neural radiance caching has the potential to improve performance by reducing the number of rays needed for a given scene. Although benefits diminish as the scene becomes more dynamic.  Ray regeneration is more about image quality (noise reduction) but could allow for fewer rays meaning higher performance.  Improved FSR4 is again about image quality but if that lets you run at lower input resolutions then it increases performance.

AMD,ndabs9f,"No, AMD does not have tensor cores named or structured exactly like NVIDIA's in the RTX 9000 series GPUs. NVIDIA's tensor cores are dedicated, specialized hardware units within each streaming multiprocessor optimized for matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) operations in AI and machine learning workloads, such as DLSS upscaling and neural rendering. These have evolved across generations (e.g., 5th-gen in Blackwell) with support for formats like FP8, sparsity, and high-throughput INT8/FP16 computations.  Instead, AMD's RDNA 4 architecture (powering the Radeon RX 9000 series, launched in early 2025) uses {AI Accelerators} (second-generation in RDNA 4) as its equivalent for AI acceleration. These are not fully standalone ""cores"" like NVIDIA's but integrated into the compute units (CUs) via specialized tensor ALUs and instructions like Wave Matrix Multiply-Accumulate (WMMA). This enables similar matrix operations for tasks like FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), an ML-based upscaling tech that leverages hardware-accelerated FP8 WMMA for improved quality and performance over prior FSR versions.  AMD still does not have dedicated Tensor cores like Nvidia does. They're just AI cores mixed in their Compute Units..

I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,mte086a,">Faster DDR5 DRAM chips are coming, even at high capacities, but existing DIMM standard is a bottleneck due to signal degradation.   Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work.
