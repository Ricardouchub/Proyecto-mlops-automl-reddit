Intel,nf8zcs6,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than. Invest in their software stack. Developing good technology and then abandoning it instead of advancing, because abandoning it is cheaper and easier is an extremely Intel move.

No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server.

Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

Intel,nes030p,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48614326), 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88643026), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6044749), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.95716006), 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.42064992), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4713012), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 1

When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.66826093), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658418), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568377), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9011492), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040777), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75001216), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.83806634), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164697), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8814712), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97932374), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90052766), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748384), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866346), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5113533), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401754), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70765054), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8874185), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076941), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363593), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 2

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67433), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718553), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9804187), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.789196), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56807995), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224169), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943218), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6215225), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8683438), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277298), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.74155277), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8893399), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7274337), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.985618), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676907), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811373), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200319), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515256), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5171995), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736856), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets. They are even trying to enter VDI market with GPU Flex cards based on Alchemist GPUs(SR-IOV was disabled on discrete ARC consumer cards).

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.

The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.78064805), 'word': 'N', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.49205962), 'word': '##vid', 'start': 290, 'end': 293}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.59018373), 'word': 'T', 'start': 312, 'end': 313}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8755106), 'word': 'Polarix', 'start': 348, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96025205), 'word': 'R', 'start': 361, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.754549), 'word': 'PSP', 'start': 567, 'end': 570}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.49702105), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 631, 'end': 633}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.48533577), 'word': '##on VII', 'start': 635, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.808714), 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 652, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.85674125), 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 900, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7854365), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66929007), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8934811), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1491, 'end': 1494}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96433926), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1627, 'end': 1630}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.80651206), 'word': 'George', 'start': 1813, 'end': 1819}]",Tópico 2

It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic.

And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility).

They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9496492), 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91378576), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7303601), 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975333), 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8405343), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.68534803), 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 1

This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",AMD,2023-08-19 15:18:05,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9945433), 'word': 'Nintendo', 'start': 23, 'end': 31}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7072389), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 104, 'end': 108}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.736588), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 145, 'end': 149}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9411086), 'word': 'N', 'start': 262, 'end': 263}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99181014), 'word': 'C', 'start': 334, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.70186687), 'word': '##UDA', 'start': 335, 'end': 338}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9394868), 'word': 'C', 'start': 595, 'end': 596}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5928563), 'word': '##DA', 'start': 597, 'end': 599}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6947571), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 996, 'end': 999}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93300325), 'word': 'PyTorch', 'start': 1181, 'end': 1188}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8076237), 'word': 'AL', 'start': 1395, 'end': 1397}]",Tópico 5

Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff.

Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.

Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads.

Intel,nixt1zv,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,niy0ck1,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.

Intel,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.59896004), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166495), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933384), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176112), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867068), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694116), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6542172), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523955), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51501906), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546406), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089731), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235843), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 3

The memory subsystem includes 20 Gbps GDDR6 across a 256-bit wide interface, delivering 640 GB/s of memory bandwidth, supported by a 64 MB 3rd Gen Infinity Cache. The AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 achieves up to 191 TeraFLOPS FP16 dense performance and up to 1531 TOPS INT4 sparse performance, all within a power footprint of up to 300 W.   It's basically a 9070xt with 32GB of memory.",hardware,2025-10-24 15:10:35,28,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8527743), 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 8, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.539757), 'word': '##de', 'start': 10, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.75249654), 'word': '##on AI', 'start': 12, 'end': 17}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70393217), 'word': 'Na', 'start': 49, 'end': 51}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5478274), 'word': 'R', 'start': 80, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.42146304), 'word': '##NA', 'start': 82, 'end': 84}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7175953), 'word': 'AI', 'start': 144, 'end': 146}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9068587), 'word': 'R', 'start': 247, 'end': 248}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77325124), 'word': 'Infinity C', 'start': 472, 'end': 482}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.77761215), 'word': 'AMD Radeon AI', 'start': 492, 'end': 505}]",Tópico 1

Cache-aware scheduling is experimental even on Linux, Windows just won't catch up any soon.  - Games are incredibly sloppily written, and typically only optimized until the performance is considered good enough on the most common setups. Windows doesn't even offer tools to mitigate bad strategies like creating tons of threads beyond the point of reasonable scaling, unlike tools offered by Linux like a cgroup with only the X3D CCD being visible, or similarly Wine being instructed to limit the visibility of cores not desired to be used.

AMD,nkpn3ce,"The lower cache is why the requests have to be made frequently.  You have 96MB of L3 on one CCD, and 32MB on the other CCD.  If a thread on the latter needs data cached on the former, it will retrieve it over the IF link, which is slower than a local cached read, but still faster than a DRAM access (which is why the request is made in the first place).  That will then be the newest line of memory, being stored in the L1/L2 of the core that requested it, kicking out the oldest line into the L3, which in turn kicks out the oldest L3 line.  When that latter evicted line is needed again, it will have to be refetched.  It's still likely in the L3 of the first CCD, due to that being triple the size, so it will be requested over the IF link again.    But if both cache sizes are the same, then that scenario will happen much less often.  Both CCD's will end up having mostly the same cache lines stored locally, and only if the data is invalidated (which won't happen to most of the read-only memory involved with running a game) would there need to be a cross-CCD transfer for the same cache line.  There's still room for particular code to not run all that well in that scenario, but it's likely uncommon.  Worst case scenario, you just relegate such a game to a single CCD using *Process Lasso* or some other means of managing process affinity on the fly.  All of this is obvious when you compare the performance of non-X3D 16-core parts to the equivalent 8-core part.  In nearly all games, there's no real difference.

AMD,nkybml3,"Context matters.  The entire M5 SOC won’t need more than 28W sustained for its performance.  Performance wise it’s on par with the 140V and 890M when running at higher TDPs.   There is zero competition in the 28W class but it doesn’t perform better than the Intel/AMD iGPUs if you configure them to pull 70W.  You can configure the TDP up in the Intel and AMD SOCs, if you do so, they’ll perform about equal but then draw around 70W.   About the M5:   Under pure processor load, the processor can briefly consume 30.5 W before stabilizing at 27.5 W. The graphics card draws a maximum of 18-19 W.   About the AMD/intel SOCs:  The Intel chips are usually configured in the 45 W to 115 W range while it can be 30 W to 80 W in the case of AMD. What's important to note is that these CPUs require more than 70 W to achieve these results.   These statements don’t necessarily contradict each other. It’s far ahead of any competition in terms of power classes but with unlimited power the competition can match the performance or even outperform it.   The power class determines the design.  Thin and light notebooks just cannot provide proper cooling for a 70W part, especially not on battery power.  But big heavy notebooks that require constant power connections can still outperform it.

AMD,nkyju0k,"The rumored DRAM M5 uses is LPDDR5X-9600, while M4 used LPDDR5X-7500.  For power, the short answer: maybe, maybe not. How much? Likely not a lot more nor a lot less. ***Watts*** would be difficult to believe; LPDDR5X power consumption is measured in milliwatts. 9600 is a [very old (read: mature) bin](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/10l47wi/anandtech_sk_hynix_intros_lpddr5t_memory_low/), tbh.  Why does the age of the bin matter? This needs the longer answer:  1. LPDDR5X-9600, when it first launched [as LPDDR5T by SK Hynix](https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-worlds-fastest-mobile-dram-lpddr5t/) in Jan 2023, was fabbed on the 1α node.

Like CPUs & GPUs, DRAM is binned, but even more so than logic. And especiallly LPDDR5, all bins adhere to JEDEC, thus it's unlike higher-clocked DDR5 desktop DIMMs that can be cheap bins →  XMP/EXPO + pumped voltage + overclocked → guaranteed to be higher power. Desktop users don't need to care, tbh. 3. So higher-clocked LPDDR5 does **not** *need* to consume more power, especially as that bin matures. LPDDR5X-9600 is almost three years old now, which is ancient for a LPDDR bin.  If this was LPDDR5X-10700 that is very new, maybe slightly more power, but LPDDR5X-9600 alone is not the primary reason for M5's higher power consumption.",hardware,2025-10-23 14:05:51,8,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.50789016), 'word': 'DR', 'start': 12, 'end': 14}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7181249), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 28, 'end': 30}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7360996), 'word': 'LP', 'start': 56, 'end': 58}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89587045), 'word': 'SK Hynix', 'start': 529, 'end': 537}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.992409), 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 904, 'end': 909}]",Tópico 4

Please, understand that in the technical sense, the ram is not the issue IC side, It's cpu/user error causing said instability. |  It took me 7 9800X3Ds before I found 1 that would do 6400mhz/2200FCLK, and only 1 of 6 14900k's which would do 8000Mhz stable, first hand with stability testing, I can unbiasedly say it's not the ram, but the controllers/lottery.",hardware,2025-10-24 03:49:44,1,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9122906), 'word': 'Reddit', 'start': 20, 'end': 26}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99737287), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 173, 'end': 178}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9529982), 'word': 'IMC', 'start': 233, 'end': 236}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.99212635), 'word': 'St', 'start': 341, 'end': 343}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': np.float32(0.87720263), 'word': 'God', 'start': 348, 'end': 351}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7947952), 'word': 'X', 'start': 353, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7380553), 'word': '##eon 6', 'start': 354, 'end': 359}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8908762), 'word': 'Xeon', 'start': 397, 'end': 401}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5646044), 'word': 'Epy', 'start': 402, 'end': 405}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9281349), 'word': 'Controller', 'start': 459, 'end': 469}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97482157), 'word': 'Nova Lake', 'start': 541, 'end': 550}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6896771), 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 556, 'end': 559}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.82418203), 'word': '6', 'start': 560, 'end': 561}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67720795), 'word': 'IMC', 'start': 597, 'end': 600}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8969178), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 882, 'end': 885}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94683915), 'word': 'Alderlake', 'start': 911, 'end': 920}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.76237696), 'word': 'I', 'start': 1119, 'end': 1120}]",Tópico 4

This is just such a suggestive introduction. Because either the author wants to portray AMDs position on this issue as wrong (therefore claim AMD spreads misinformation) or really doesnt see any other way why AMD would make ARM Systems. Which could be to introduce ARM cores as it seems like a lot of the server market and maybe even windows pushes into the ARM Space, AMD just wants to get a piece of that cake too independent of the ISA.  >As an Arm design, it's likely to incorporate a big.LITTLE architecture  Interesting wording, lets see how Videocardz (which seems to be the primary source for this) comments it:  >Earlier leaks described the chip as featuring 2 P-cores and 4 E-cores. It reportedly integrates four RDNA 3.5 compute units \[...\]  Interesting, if this is a small AMD CPU, do we have any Comparison? Ohh yes, there is Kraken Point with 3+3C and 4 RDNA3.5 CUs, so if AMD just applies the same philosophies to their ARM IP (of which they likely have their own cores) which they have applied to Zen 5, we wont see a true big.LITTLE, but just a performance.COMPACT layout which is different from the usual ARM structure of actually changing the core.

Gaming on 4 RDNA3.5 CUs will be, ""ok"", wont be anything great, and the 10W TDP is also not that low. If we look again at the Ryzen AI 340 which has a similar layout this chip can already play on 10W, and chips like the 8840U as found in the GPD can already game on a 10W power cap. And with indie-games those chips might consume only \~5W, so it isnt really that impressive.  The question is if AMD can get their idle/office use power draw for these chips below \~2W and standby power draw to almost nil. 10W TDP isnt anything new for gaming on AMD chips. Especially because the Steam Decks Van Gogh (which I wouldnt use for comparison because it is a very old chip) games in the same \~10W since forever.  Also just imagine if we put Kraken Point on N3E or something, the cTDP of AMD currently goes as low as 15W on N4P (even though OEMs can introduce custom power limits). If we shrunk it to N3E, and put the CPU into a 2+4 config we could see how a roughly 10W lower cTDP is not really that far off.    So yeah, next-gen APU goes as low as 10W, shocking.

AMD,njluhau,"I think both options are possible.  On the one hand: Why would AMD go through the effort of creating a ARM core or repurposing a Zen architecture (I'd suspect it be Zen 6) just for a niche product, also AMD probably has good experience building ARM APUs, from their cooperation with Samsung.  On the other hand: AMD has good experience with ARM and invested into custom designs in the pre-Zen time, they already have all the design capabilities and a strong CPU-Architecture they could share many structures with. And they can only win with (semi)custom CPUs anyways. I dont think they can gain the edge in Servers (which is most likely the long-term-goal), with default ARM cores which the Hyperscalers could just license themselves. AMD doesnt need to ""practice"" building chips, they have all the experience.  I think the PPA of something like Zen 6 on N3 isnt to bad compared to ARMs big cores. The X925 or C1-Ultra aren't particularly small. The only question is if AMD can solve idle power draw and performance-efficiency, but that is something they have to solve either way, especially to keep the x86 data center moat healthy. Additionally I dont think these cores are suited for server, so if AMD wants to share knowledge as heavy as they do it with Zen, this might not be a good investment.  So yes while it might is attractive and much simpler to go with ARM based core IP I think for the long term goal it might not be so beneficial, as they are going up against Nvidia+MediaTek who have access to the same IP, so if AMD offers nothing different it will be interesting where they believe they have the edge.

For the regular price of the 9700X I would have looked at a tray version of the 7800X3D.  > Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK ?  For the build the 750W unit is more than enough. However it is worth noting that the price gap between 750W and 850W units is exceptionally small at the moment and it may be wise to just get the similarly priced 850W unit for more optionality if you choose to upgrade in the future.  > Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that  A B650E mainboard is pretty much as futureproof as a B850 but a normal B650 does not support PCIe 5.0 GPUs. It's currently not an issue but if you could see yourself upgrade to an RTX xx80 class (or AMD equivalent card) in the future, you may hit the PCIe 4.0 bottleneck.  > For the 9070XT, I mostly see Saphire and XFX at lower prices > are these reliable brands?

AMD,nkljcdp,"**Answers:**  **What do you think of the build? Is it solid or has it flaws?**   The CPU + GPU combo is rock solid. I’ve got the same setup and haven’t had a single issue running new titles on ultra settings. My 1080p monitor is the only bottleneck now 😅  **Is the PSU enough for the build (9070XT more specifically), or would a 750W PSU be OK?**   750W should technically be enough, check the GPU vendor specifications just to be safe.  **Is the B850 mobo really needed? Or is a B650 (E?) enough? I see contradictory information on that.**   I’m using the MSI B650 Plus and it works perfectly fine. Unless you need advanced PCIe 5.0 support or beefier VRMs for heavy overclocking, B650(E) should be enough.  **For the 9070XT, I mostly see Sapphire and XFX at lower prices. Are these reliable brands? Or should I prefer Gigabyte or ASRock, for example?**   I went with Sapphire—great cooling and no issues so far. If you're not into overclocking, Sapphire or XFX are solid picks. For more aggressive tuning, you might want to compare thermals and VRMs across brands.  **Do I need to buy thermal paste separately?**   I didn’t. My cooler came with pre-applied paste, and I run my CPU at 105W mode. If you’re planning to push beyond that, investing in a good thermal paste could help.  **Do I need a GPU bracket/support/holder?**   Yes—definitely recommended. The 9070XT is a heavy card, and a bracket helps prevent long-term sag or stress on the PCIe slot.  **Do I need anything else that won’t be provided with any of the components yet?**   If you’ve got a modular PSU, make sure you have all the necessary power cables. Also double-check for case screws, standoffs, and Wi-Fi antennas (if your mobo supports it).",pcmasterrace,2025-10-21 13:32:50,2,Positive,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9503969), 'word': 'MS', 'start': 557, 'end': 559}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5577253), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 740, 'end': 742}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7793155), 'word': '##pphire', 'start': 742, 'end': 748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67109156), 'word': 'X', 'start': 753, 'end': 754}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4133612), 'word': 'Giga', 'start': 820, 'end': 824}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4467494), 'word': 'AS', 'start': 832, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.52051735), 'word': 'Sapphire', 'start': 869, 'end': 877}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.4568545), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 947, 'end': 949}]",Tópico 3

Previously AMD stated that it makes no sense as the gain would be negligible.   Even it X3D2 were true: in terms of money/value these CPUs would probably be very poor. Insanely expensive for very small uplifts compared to the base version. Games rarely profit from more than 8 cores which is why 1CCD with X3D is enough. You basically pay to avoid potential scheduling issues that were a thing in the past. Seems rather useless.  As for the rumored 8C/16T, as in 9850X3D or whatever you want to call it, it just seems weird. Like why would this exist? It would only compete again zen6. What would be the point of this thing. All you are doing is massively skewing the expectation for the eventual next gen while already being market leader and performance king. The entire SKU makes no sense.   The only reality where this part makes sense if they expect Intels upcoming gen in early 2026 to beat the 9800X3D of its throne (which seems highly unlikely at this point but maybe they know more than we do).

You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.

Of course this is a ROG model but nobody seems to want to compete with a Mac Mini or Studio these days.   In part that seems to me to be an indicator that X86 is dead.  I'm waiting to see some real world test on NVIDIA new box.   That DGX Spark is really interesting but also expensive, that especially if the ARM cores are generic.   You are actually getting a lot for your $4000 but that is not even in the ball park for me.  In any event back to Amd and the small form factor market.    I really don't know why they can't do something that people would really want to buy.   That would be a SoC based machine, internal power supply (bricks are nuts on desktops), fast SSD capability and enough RAM capability to remain useful for more than a year.

AMD,nk8ny3w,I think we are on the same page here.   AMD performance lags M5 significantly in many respects and neither Intel nor AMD have lowered the power enough to really make NUC sized machines viable.   What really sets Apple apart in my mind is that their SOC supplies what is mostly needs for a small for factor machine.   Basically the M series is a tiny step up from a cell phone / laptop chip in its base form.   Just enough additional tech to make really nice entry level machines.  Now given that I'd admit that AMD has some nice SOC but the power draw is insanely higher for small form factor machines.

I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Intel,2025-10-22 04:59:31,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.998371), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 83, 'end': 93}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.59896004), 'word': 'Devi', 'start': 274, 'end': 278}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.67166495), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 281, 'end': 288}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8933384), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 408, 'end': 416}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99516875), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 452, 'end': 458}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9176112), 'word': 'Ethernet', 'start': 467, 'end': 475}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.35867068), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 496, 'end': 502}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8694116), 'word': 'Manager', 'start': 571, 'end': 578}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6542172), 'word': 'Killer Control Center', 'start': 594, 'end': 615}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6523955), 'word': 'Killer Network Service', 'start': 621, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99736786), 'word': 'Windows 11', 'start': 697, 'end': 707}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.51501906), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 870, 'end': 876}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9946823), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 935, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8546406), 'word': 'KillerSoftwareU', 'start': 1024, 'end': 1039}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.47646984), 'word': '##stal', 'start': 1042, 'end': 1046}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99127823), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1252, 'end': 1258}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9948334), 'word': 'Windows Update', 'start': 1283, 'end': 1297}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8089731), 'word': 'Dell', 'start': 1363, 'end': 1367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9267264), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1397, 'end': 1402}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5235843), 'word': 'Killer', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97373724), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1463, 'end': 1468}]",Tópico 3

AMD,nflsfzz,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

AMD,n212egt,"Edit: solved. Windows is capable of disabling e-cores on boot. The setting to turn them back on in MSCONFIG, boot tab, cores dropdown. Whatever feature causes this, I do not know but would love to find out, and furthermore their is no legitimate purpose for this feature, and Intel should prevent Microsoft from doing this, in my opinion, if there is any legal means available. Unless it interferes with Intel’s revenue.  Poor performance, incredibly low benchmarks. Beginning to suspect bad CPU.  I have tried bone stock with cleared CMOS settings. I have loaded multiple overclocking profiles, clearing CMOS in between. I have tried undervolting, and adjusting Load Line. I have changed Lite Load settings. I have tried with and without XMP enabled. Changed windows power plans. Nothing gets my cinebench r23 score above 11k. CPU-Z benchmarks it as 43% as fast as the previous generation CPU.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone?

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue.

AMD,navj4sy,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Intel,2025-08-27 01:58:06,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9981675), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 60, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5757747), 'word': 'X', 'start': 142, 'end': 143}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.91609645), 'word': 'X', 'start': 181, 'end': 182}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72410965), 'word': 'VROC', 'start': 213, 'end': 217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9975128), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 316, 'end': 321}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9981376), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 362, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7147023), 'word': 'X', 'start': 446, 'end': 447}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.508391), 'word': 'AS', 'start': 537, 'end': 539}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6538832), 'word': 'MS', 'start': 543, 'end': 545}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7536661), 'word': 'G', 'start': 548, 'end': 549}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84802693), 'word': 'VROC', 'start': 631, 'end': 635}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7676257), 'word': 'X', 'start': 668, 'end': 669}]",Tópico 3
