I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

Intel,nzddzc6,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered.

Intel,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins.

I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.

Intel,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.

Intel,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

Intel,ntckb4u,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Intel,ntco5ms,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",hardware,2025-12-10 20:41:27,-3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.84373665), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 52, 'end': 61}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8637726), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 63, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.77772593), 'word': 'Met', 'start': 101, 'end': 104}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.60526806), 'word': '##eor', 'start': 104, 'end': 107}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.8935882), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 108, 'end': 112}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.76103985), 'word': 'Arrow Lake', 'start': 114, 'end': 124}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.78146845), 'word': 'Luna', 'start': 130, 'end': 134}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58814985), 'word': '##r', 'start': 134, 'end': 135}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.969792), 'word': 'Lake', 'start': 136, 'end': 140}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.86424404), 'word': 'Cine', 'start': 216, 'end': 220}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7164212), 'word': '##ben', 'start': 220, 'end': 223}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7820186), 'word': 'TSMC', 'start': 462, 'end': 466}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9941365), 'word': 'IPC', 'start': 558, 'end': 561}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8300362), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 760, 'end': 769}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98455614), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 777, 'end': 785}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9908302), 'word': 'IPC', 'start': 820, 'end': 823}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9818982), 'word': 'Geekbench', 'start': 894, 'end': 903}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9830823), 'word': 'PassMark', 'start': 962, 'end': 970}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.81780267), 'word': 'Cine', 'start': 1281, 'end': 1285}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5331536), 'word': '##ben', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1288}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.6922186), 'word': '##ch', 'start': 1288, 'end': 1290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8266066), 'word': 'Cinebench', 'start': 1378, 'end': 1387}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.977803), 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1446, 'end': 1454}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8220633), 'word': 'Elite', 'start': 1459, 'end': 1464}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9303264), 'word': 'Panther', 'start': 1573, 'end': 1580}]",Tópico 5

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.

Intel,npcp3di,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Intel,nngjg8l,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power.

The best possible outcome for Intel is actually that they can't hit the same peak voltage but look ok at low to mid.    > Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it   Server is typically low voltage, or mid voltage at most. It's lower down than even laptop chips. And what desktop? Intel's using N2 for their flagship chips for NVL, which should really have been an obvious indicator for how 18A fairs.    > I'd expect 65W to 105W on 18A to yield 20-25% due to the benefits of BPD.   Intel had numbers in their white paper. BSPD, all else equal, was maybe a couple percent at high V. It's not going to produce dramatically different scaling, and again, we have direct evidence to the contrary here.    In general, Intel's had a lot of process features over the years that look a lot better on slides than they end up doing in silicon.",hardware,2025-11-06 19:18:34,15,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9961576), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 194, 'end': 199}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9970764), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 378, 'end': 383}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9958513), 'word': 'ST', 'start': 547, 'end': 549}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978022), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 747, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 956, 'end': 961}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99847454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1218, 'end': 1223}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.4230071), 'word': 'BP', 'start': 1413, 'end': 1415}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99773186), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1420, 'end': 1425}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6666114), 'word': 'BS', 'start': 1460, 'end': 1462}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99838483), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1650, 'end': 1655}]",Tópico 5

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Intel,o0ntbi2,"Yeah, id get the 14600k then. It's more than fine for a 5080/5070ti.  Yes, Arc runs perfectly as is.  And yes, frame gen has been incredible, honestly. While the messaging about how it's useless when you're below 60fps is accurate, it is actually beautiful if you like having high fps.  For example, in Outer Worlds 2, my FPS in the town area drops to 54-57 fps. However, multi frame gen, gives me a very comfortable high refresh experience. Likewise frame gen in arc raiders, space marine 2, and indiana jones feel really good.  I also have the Lossless scaling app and honestly, Nvidia frame gen is several times better. I remember testing out lossless scaling in several games and the only game where it felt nice was in Kingdom Come Deliverance 1. However, in games like helldivers, the input lag was very noticable even if you had 60fps base.  Here's another amazing part about 5000 series. Smooth motion. I discovered it only recently and if you weren't aware, its the driver side implementation of frame gen. With the nvidia app, I can turn it on in almost any game, including old ones like control and games like Enshrouded which dont come with any frame gen.  let me tell you, even this driver level frame gen is so much better than lossless scaling. I was recording benchmarks with my 12400f yesterday just so that I can have a comparison when I make the switch and something funny happened. I was playing helldivers and was wondering why I was getting 120 fps. I had remembered it being 60fps earlier. For a moment, I thought my CPU had become unthrottled or that a mew patch had droppeed with massive fps improvements. However, I suddenly realized that I had simply enabled smooth motion earlier. It's legit like native 120 fps and I didnt even realize it.  Of course, dont' expect it to make 60fps feel nice if you only have 30fps (Thankfully, that will never happen right now with this tier of cards as even Path tracing on cp2077 gives me like 55fps). However, who knows what magic nvidia will cook up next. Dynamic frame gen might be super interesting to try in spring as well.  I was this close to actually getting a 9070xt. However, after experiencing frame gen, both native and driver level, and now the new and improved dlss4.5, im so glad I trusted my gut and went Nvidia. It came at a massive price here in India as well (like $965) but when im dropping big money on a card, Id rather get the best feature set than save what is a negligble amount in the context of the  4-5 years I will be using the card.

Intel,o07z7s0,"The ""f"" indicator on the CPUs means that it's a version with the internal graphics chip disabled, which is generally not a problem if you're going to have a dedicated GPU, and shouldn't effect performance.  The ""k"" indicator means that the CPU has a higher max power draw, and that it's unlocked for overclocking. To overclock, you also need a Z-series motherboard. The higher max power draw does mean that even with your B-series board, the ""k"" CPU will be able to run slightly faster than the ""non-k"" variant of the same CPU, usually translating to around ~5% more performance in real world scenarios.   The 14700k(f) is 0-10% faster at most vs the 14600k(f) in gaming workloads, depending on the game, so the 14700 non-k would be even less of a difference vs the 14600k(f). There's generally no reason to go for a non-k variant over the k variant if it's not cheaper, and the same goes for the f CPUs. In the UK, it looks like the 14600 non-k is not available anymore from major retailers, and the 14600kf is about £20 cheaper than the 14600k, so probably worth saving the money with the f model in your case.  I usually use this as a quick reference for power supply requirements with CPU + GPU combinations: https://www.msi.com/blog/recommended-psu-table  You can see that for an Intel i7 CPU with the RTX 5080, they indicate that an 850w PSU should be fine if you aren't looking to overclock, so as long as your PSU is a good quality 850w, I wouldn't worry about the power draw.   On the other hand, the 5080 uses Nvidia's new 12pin HPWR connector, which requires an (included) adapter to be used with older PSUs. This connector has a pretty bad reputation for pulling power unevenly and *melting* if the connections are not secure, so most people advise to use power supplies with native 12pin HPWR connectors if possible, to avoid extra points of failure. If you're careful (or if your PSU has these connectors natively - it's usually indicated on the box as ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1), then it *shouldn't* be an issue, but these connectors are very finicky, so people are usually quite cautious about them.   The only other thing to note is that DDR4 does tend to effect the performance of these CPUs vs DDR5, which can range quite a bit depending on the game, with a few edge-cases actually running better on good quality DDR4 (games that prefer memory latency vs speed). This also effects 12th and 13th gen CPUs, so the performance differences between CPUs will still be the same in a relative sense, when both are using DDR4.",buildapc,2026-01-18 02:30:20,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.98424464), 'word': 'Z', 'start': 344, 'end': 345}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6837766), 'word': 'B', 'start': 422, 'end': 423}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.99870276), 'word': 'UK', 'start': 912, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9930402), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1290}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9724063), 'word': 'R', 'start': 1307, 'end': 1308}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.77701116), 'word': 'HP', 'start': 1539, 'end': 1541}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86039835), 'word': 'HP', 'start': 1801, 'end': 1803}]",Tópico 1

The original P12 has always had a balance issue when standing vertical position. If ran for 4 hours a day daily, after a year, I can hear the noise would increase and be a really faint bearing noise.  This is NOT an issue with P12 ARGB and P12 Pro as they have a revised fan design and I would totally recommend them over the original P12.

Intel,o0gqiq7,"That's not how it works. Increasing resolution doesn't inherently take load off the CPU. What actually reduces CPU load is lowering the number of frames the system is trying to produce. When you raise the resolution and the GPU can't render as many frames, CPU load will drop as a side effect, but that's due to the reduced framerate, not the resolution increase itself.  If you cap the FPS to, say, 60 at both 1080p and 4K (assuming the GPU can handle both), the CPU workload will be the same. The CPU's job is tied to how many frames it has to prepare, not the resolution those frames are rendered at. When you're CPU limited, it means the processor is already producing as many frames as it can. Raising the resolution won't magically allow it to produce more frames, it just risks shifting you into a GPU bottleneck instead.

Dont get me wrong though, valve is not perfect, they literally pionieered lootboxes with tf2 man. co and they do make a buck out of gambling. but the Pros heavily outweigh the cons.  edit;Typos",pcmasterrace,2026-01-18 23:56:31,37,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98843825), 'word': 'Valve', 'start': 63, 'end': 68}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9117031), 'word': 'Deadlock', 'start': 103, 'end': 111}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.61150426), 'word': 'Steam', 'start': 474, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.82883024), 'word': 'Steam', 'start': 640, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6108164), 'word': 'Remote', 'start': 646, 'end': 652}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9818771), 'word': 'Xbox', 'start': 727, 'end': 731}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9894995), 'word': 'Valve', 'start': 797, 'end': 802}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7262666), 'word': 'FEX', 'start': 817, 'end': 820}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6385649), 'word': 'E', 'start': 821, 'end': 822}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9468716), 'word': 'x', 'start': 887, 'end': 888}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7341834), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 903, 'end': 905}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.54683477), 'word': 'Steam', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1020}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6840024), 'word': 'Steam Controller 2', 'start': 1030, 'end': 1048}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.60977685), 'word': 'Steam Frame', 'start': 1054, 'end': 1065}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97238266), 'word': 'Valve', 'start': 1130, 'end': 1135}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9324081), 'word': 'Pro', 'start': 1308, 'end': 1311}]",Tópico 1

Intel,nyk0tw7,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.

Intel,nyko7q2,"Yeah, and AMD says Strix Halo has four channels in their customer facing spec as well, because they have 128b and 256b buses respectively. They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

Panther Lake's cpu is built on the most advanced silicon process node 18A, designed to compete against TSMC's N2 (2nm) which is set to release in products in the second half of 2026. Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Intel,nymut0x,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes.

The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks.

Can't even finish the training course even with ""speedrun strats"" before it crashes. It boosts [momentarily to 3300+](https://i.ibb.co/bgLFC0dp/coreclockcrash.png) and I get a screen freeze, crash, and sent to desktop with a driver timeout.

Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",AMD,2025-11-14 05:48:36,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.86930275), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 100, 'end': 102}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.78668326), 'word': 'Ch', 'start': 371, 'end': 373}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9945775), 'word': 'Edge', 'start': 416, 'end': 420}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6136532), 'word': 'Ch', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1024}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.68942505), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1070, 'end': 1073}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9185944), 'word': 'TD', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1134}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9277409), 'word': 'Firefox', 'start': 1242, 'end': 1249}]",Tópico 4

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,22,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.96047413), 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97551155), 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.47393385), 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9978709), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9221623), 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936434), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70016813), 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99374455), 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.97952205), 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.996042), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9800243), 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9670311), 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9871013), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9752412), 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 1

Intel,lgyqo0o,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9922133), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6682615), 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99653184), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86584127), 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.64568275), 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.90114915), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87513644), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8040758), 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7500115), 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8380654), 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8164692), 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.88147104), 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9793236), 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9005273), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.69748294), 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.58866495), 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.511351), 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99225956), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80401796), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7076516), 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88741785), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5076931), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7363588), 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9888704), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99029034), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro.

As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",AMD,2024-04-01 13:54:35,3,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.780761), 'word': 'YouTube', 'start': 186, 'end': 193}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.632216), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 202, 'end': 205}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.89879507), 'word': 'N', 'start': 210, 'end': 211}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.52583975), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 211, 'end': 213}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.71377695), 'word': '##DIA', 'start': 213, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56497085), 'word': 'AM', 'start': 266, 'end': 268}]",Tópico 4

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",AMD,2024-04-01 02:18:57,26,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96870226), 'word': 'SR', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9156764), 'word': 'I', 'start': 3, 'end': 4}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9579422), 'word': 'M', 'start': 11, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6767603), 'word': 'N', 'start': 78, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': np.float32(0.69673014), 'word': '##VI', 'start': 79, 'end': 81}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8865069), 'word': '##DI', 'start': 81, 'end': 83}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98826766), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 142, 'end': 145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81870246), 'word': 'VFIO', 'start': 220, 'end': 224}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9004071), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 270, 'end': 273}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.97644997), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 355, 'end': 358}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.78370017), 'word': 'V', 'start': 478, 'end': 479}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9868846), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 541, 'end': 544}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8120332), 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 637, 'end': 643}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.40551057), 'word': 'M', 'start': 679, 'end': 680}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7868693), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 721, 'end': 727}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.657153), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 746, 'end': 752}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99238694), 'word': 'Debian', 'start': 835, 'end': 841}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86615694), 'word': 'Proxmox', 'start': 865, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9936753), 'word': 'N', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.81987095), 'word': '##utanix', 'start': 906, 'end': 912}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9508743), 'word': 'VMware', 'start': 923, 'end': 929}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9956404), 'word': 'Broadcom', 'start': 941, 'end': 949}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9882114), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7132545), 'word': 'V', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.93465674), 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1279, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.91439724), 'word': 'Redhat', 'start': 1285, 'end': 1291}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8658943), 'word': 'Spice', 'start': 1293, 'end': 1298}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxtr5do,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,kxxn4fl,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",AMD,2024-04-03 23:33:02,2,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.995836), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 9, 'end': 12}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.67432916), 'word': 'B', 'start': 77, 'end': 78}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7718556), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 130, 'end': 133}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.98041874), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 265, 'end': 270}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7891968), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 294, 'end': 298}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.56808084), 'word': 'Open', 'start': 336, 'end': 340}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6224168), 'word': '##CL', 'start': 340, 'end': 342}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9943219), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 495, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.997389), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 585, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.62152374), 'word': '##U', 'start': 593, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99866533), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 636, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.86834437), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 668, 'end': 673}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9983454), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 685, 'end': 690}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8277303), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 748, 'end': 753}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99850535), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 843, 'end': 848}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7415536), 'word': 'ZLU', 'start': 864, 'end': 867}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88934016), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 925, 'end': 930}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99857795), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 963, 'end': 968}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.72743416), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1022, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.991135), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1044, 'end': 1049}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9856181), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1096, 'end': 1099}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99898607), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1132, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9676909), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1151, 'end': 1156}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99495494), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1183, 'end': 1186}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9952302), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6811376), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1295, 'end': 1300}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7200327), 'word': 'ZLUDA', 'start': 1356, 'end': 1361}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99592286), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1424, 'end': 1427}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7515257), 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1485}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.5172002), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1506, 'end': 1508}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9934948), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1719, 'end': 1724}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.50736785), 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1763, 'end': 1765}]",Tópico 4

Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.

If the dual GPU version was really available for $999 right now (as announced), then Intel would make significant inroads into the local AI market.  As it is, buying this for $800 over a used 3090 is a really hard sell. Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.

I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

AMD,nyzybbo,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",hardware,2026-01-11 16:53:47,7,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.99530303), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 10, 'end': 13}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.71971744), 'word': 'PS5', 'start': 33, 'end': 36}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9986958), 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 90, 'end': 94}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5870024), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 120, 'end': 122}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9838643), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 171, 'end': 174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.88663596), 'word': 'St', 'start': 416, 'end': 418}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8116927), 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 422, 'end': 426}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7045092), 'word': 'SON', 'start': 431, 'end': 434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7414605), 'word': 'SONY', 'start': 518, 'end': 522}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980957), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 527, 'end': 536}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.69639087), 'word': 'SONY', 'start': 827, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9980106), 'word': 'Microsoft', 'start': 835, 'end': 844}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.90673), 'word': 'PS', 'start': 1038, 'end': 1040}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.76247233), 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 1158, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7628501), 'word': 'Desktop', 'start': 1347, 'end': 1354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.75722647), 'word': 'Laptop', 'start': 1359, 'end': 1365}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.87763405), 'word': 'St', 'start': 1443, 'end': 1445}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8686896), 'word': 'Halo', 'start': 1449, 'end': 1453}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.5764847), 'word': 'AP', 'start': 1481, 'end': 1483}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9519313), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1641, 'end': 1646}]",Tópico 3

So it’s lost future revenue as well.   Marketshare isn’t this measure of who’s winning for a particular generation. It has tremendous “stickiness” and momentum where any competitor would have to have the better product for multiple generations in order to even get minority of the market.

Nvidia claims FP64 performance doesn't need to improve with each generation, because they claim that the Ozaki scheme can exploit the ever increasing number of low-precision tensor cores and make up for the lost performance.  But AMD argues that the Ozaki scheme is only for matrix multiplication, and that many of the HPC applications they have studied don't make heavy enough use of it to result in a net performance gain with emulated FP64.  There's a whole section in the article about the applicability of the Ozaki scheme:  > Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations. > > According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.  > > ""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it's a tiny fraction of the market, but it's actually a niche piece."" > > For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia's Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip's CUDA cores.  These facts don't change just because emulated FP64 becomes IEEE-compliant. AMD states that they are presently studying **if** making FP64 emulation complaint can make the Ozaki scheme usable for more applications.

AMD,o0nam6q,"Well, you got a point, I phrased that badly.   No, HPL is a politically motivated benchmark with zero applicability in the real world that causes real harm to the HPC world and is horrendously expensive to run.    If you're interested in this, here is a slightly longer explanation (It's a slightly modified copy paste from a different explanation from me, so some things might seem a bit off to you)  It was created to ""prove"" performance claims by manufactures. Back in the day even CPUs had a claimed theoretical max performance, usually in GFLOPS. But what does it even mean and where does this number come from? It tells you how many floating point operations (typically 64 bit) a processor can theoretically do. It's calculated by core count \* clockspeed \* fp operations per cycle. So, it tells you how many operations the CPU can do if every single clock cycle was used to calculate as many operations as theoretically possible per cycle. For modern CPUs, lets use a 7950X as an example: It has 16 cores, runs at a base frequency of 4.5GHz, has two 256 vector ALUs and supports FMA (fused multiply add, performs two operations in one cycle), so it's two operations per cycle on 8 (2x 256bit = 8x 64bit) FP per core on 16 cores 4.5G times per second. So 4.5 x 16 x 8 x 2 = 1152GFLOPS. The same math applies to GPUs where the performance claim is usually still marketed.   HPL is a benchmark that was created to get as close as possible to this number. It's designed to minimize overhead, memory, networking etc, and use 100% speedup from wider vector units etc. And not only that, every single manufacturer has their own optimized HPL version. On intel CPUs you run an intel optimized version on AMD an AMD optimized version etc. To get back to the example, [here](https://wp-cdn.pugetsystems.com/2022/08/hpl-zen4.png) is a test from puget systems with a result of 1011GFLOPS which means a \~87% efficiency.    And that's basically the thing, the more time you spend optimizing, the closer you get to the optimum which is about 85-95% of theoretical maximum. And not only that, if you spend enough time optimizing and distributing load, you can even throw in a GPU and add the performance to the total performance. It's essentially just about how much time you're willing to invest into it.   The problem is, none of that translates into any real world performance. This [chart](https://www.pugetsystems.com/pic_disp.php?id=68180) shows how random many results seem to be (intel dominates there because of their early AVX 512 adoption). In the real world, especially in HPC the software is far more complex and more I/O, network and memory dependent than pure compute bound.    There isn't a single common HPC workload that scales with performance as HPL does, none.   The benchmark exists for the top500 list and to ""validate"" the performance claims. It's for politics, to be able to say ""our supercomputer is faster than yours"".",hardware,2026-01-20 10:57:21,5,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6065375), 'word': 'HP', 'start': 51, 'end': 53}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9564781), 'word': 'HPC', 'start': 163, 'end': 166}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6700543), 'word': 'HP', 'start': 1380, 'end': 1382}]",Tópico 5

AMD,o0nape6,"(2/2 I hit the comment length limit)  And that's where the problem starts. I did work at a super computer place at a time where they were looking for a new system. Because most scientific super computers are paid by the state/city/whatever and it's a political thing, HPL is a real problem because politicians want to see results and they only care about HPL and where it lands in the top 500 list.   Thing is that running HPL is horrendously expensive. If you want good results you can easily spend like 2-4 weeks on optimizing and benchmarking, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize that if a supercomputer is used for 5 years, that's 1-2% of the whole lifetime and therefore cost.   Next problem is that GPUs are still not that great in HPC and a lot still runs on CPUs for many different reasons. The place I worked at had zero uses for GPUs as their main software had no GPU support. They had some, mostly for analyzing results (and visualization) that was purely built on CUDA. But GPUs offer like 10x the performance in HPL compared to a CPU socket and are far more cost effective.   But money came from politics and they didn't want a rather small uplift (plans were to spend a lot on networking and storage) and therefore they had to buy some GPU racks and spend less on storage and CPU nodes. And because AMD GPUs were faster at that time in HPL, there was pressure to buy AMD GPUs (which they didn't but they bought a lot of nvidia GPUs).   I can't speak for all supercomputers but at least to me it's not surpring how much more successful AMD is with their datacenter GPUs in the Top500 list (which AMD likes to say for marketing reasons).   Just makes it a bit funny when AMDs only example for the need for native FP64 performance is HPL.

Even when people were blaming ASRock MBs, the whole thing was suspicious, because once a popular news outlet writes an article ""ASRock motherboards are *frying* our CPUs!!!"" everyone with that mobo will find out about it and report it.

On average I buy a flagship card and then keep it for 6-8 years to get the value back out of it, my last was a 1080 Ti that I would've kept on using except a forced monitor upgrade to 4K was too much for it to handle. So don't get me wrong, I own a 4090 and I treat the thing like it's a glass explosive. I also use an ASRock board for my 7700X and wouldn't even consider swapping it for any other brand. I'll agree the AMD issues seem to be very minimal, but there simply is no excuse for the 12VHPWR thing.

Karhu 2.0 is also coming out pretty soon which looks even better.  I have not tried OCCT for memory testing, though I do use it for GPU and CPU stress testing. I do not like that you basically have to subscribe to their Patreon for $6 per month if you want to run tests longer than an hour, whereas Karhu it is a one time payment of like $10.

Intel has also shown us that the Fmax of PTL is *lower* than ARL-H and on par with Lunar Lake.   ST perf is likely, at best, to be a draw against ARL-H. Uncore improvements might be able to improve PPC marginally, depending on the workload, even if the core architecture couldn't.   nT perf could improve marginally given the stronger core setup (4+8+4 *proper LPEs* is stronger than 6+8+2), but even for that, Intel is claiming only ""on par"" nT perf with the HX370 in Cinebench 2024 and 2026.   Gaming perf with a dGPU is kinda a toss up IMO vs ARL-H. Better mem latency, prob better L3 latency, but smaller L3 capacity, fewer P-cores, and lower boost clocks.

AMD,o061dd0,"Yes, they're pretty good but very clearly a few steps below where they sit in single threaded performance.  Intel is also on an architecture that's burdened with Windows (which is a far worse OS in terms of battery life and bloat and which isn't tailored to those CPUs like MacOS is for Apple) and which wasn't targeted for low power usage until just now. Lunar Lake is their first real attempt at that and it's miles closer than any attempt before it. Before this it was basically just the desktop CPU that was fit into a laptop.  M3 was Apples 3rd gen. Again, Lunar Lake was the first for Intel and iirc Apple actually helped make N3 in the first place so they're far more familiar with the nodes when they develop their CPUs. And Lunar Lake is a chiplet design iirc which has some inherent issues with efficiency and means that it's not pure N3 but a mix of more and less efficient nodes.  Having memory on the same SOC and the Node advantage absolutely play a critical role in the performance Apple has achieved per watt. It reduces power consumption and allows much higher bandwidth and reduces some of the logic Apple needs to make.  Also, have we seen the benchmarks for 18A? I'm not sure it's better than N3P. Definitely more at home for Intel though.  Do you have some benchmarks for Panther Lake CPUs?

THEY setup the fake msrp to lie to the public. the banked on most people not hearing the reporting on what actually is going on and they also banked on people not understanding, that amd is in 100% control of what price cards actually sell at.  so again you are WRONG and i am again correct with this statement:  >if amd would have wanted over 50% of all supply for example to be AT msrp, then it would have been at msrp  also i said 50% here, because that is a reasonable number, as partners of course should be free to still buy the gpu + memory at the same price, but then add value of a better cooler or vrm or other features, to add 20-50 us dollars more at the final price for example, for the higher end models.",hardware,2026-01-17 16:47:35,4,Negative,Neutral,[],Tópico 1

AMD,nxycvko,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.

AMD,ny6po5w,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.

AMD,nyd5bcu,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW?

The major stutters that were happening while textures load from a **1.5TB 5400 HDD** storage drive are gone. There are some micro stutters still but those are tolerable given the age of the system.  The 2022 Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (TTW) via STEAM running at 1080p LOW/MED/FSR 2.0 mix gets ***88+ FPS*** on the in-game benchmark...on ***Linux*** of all things! It's all in the settings mix. Been keeping me entertained even though it clearly is slower than my Ryzen 5 5600/B580 LE build that runs TTW at 1080p ULTRA with 95+ FPS. Even managed to undervolt the RX 470 by 243 mV to jump from 82+ FPS to the current 88+ FPS.  Another test just completed is that with a Linux distro and an AMD GPU that has no hardware ray tracing support (i.e., the RX 470 8GB), it is possible to have ***software emulation ray tracing***. Ran Little Nightmares Enhanced (STEAM) on 1080p ULTRA with HIGH Ray Tracing (the lowest available RT option) and got 10-20 FPS...unplayable...*BUT* with FSR Balanced turned on, then got 40-50 FPS that is totally playable.

Whereas the 7600X3D is more expensive overall being currently 344.49 on pcpartpicker due to it using the 3D Vcache technology that makes it have 3x the L3 cache to help with a more consistent and overall better FPS but reduces the clock speed being around 4.7 GHz instead of 5.3 like the 7600x or 5.4 like the 9600X making it weaker in terms of single core and multi core performance. Not to mention the availability of the 7600X3D is limited to only some stores. So for 40 dollars less than the 7800X3D you're still paying a lot just for 6 cores and extra fps.

AMD,o0nk6v1,"There are some serious diminishing returns when it comes to the relation of quality and model size. 600B parameter model isn't anywhere near 9x better than a 70B parameter model, on benchmarks the massive models performing maybe 30-40% better on most tasks. For most tasks if one were to replace a 600B model with a 70B model it would not be immediately obvious and would take a while for the user to notice that anything's different. Especially if it's just chatting. 70B is pretty much the upper limit of what a regular consumer can run on their hardware, requiring something like 2x 3090s to run well.  As for the 6GB: It seems to be either a 3B parameter model or a quantized 7B one, probably the 3B as small models suffer the most from quantization and a 7B would need to be pretty heavily quantized to fit. 3B models are pretty stupid and when chatting with them you routinely see it fail to incorporate the things you've told it into a comprehensive narrative, but they aren't completely useless as they can do relatively simple tasks with well defined goals. Like if you want to remove all the dashes and replace all the words ""cat"" with ""dog"" from a text or something like that where the logic is just ""If X then Y"". As a rule of thumb, larger the model more it can ""read between the lines"" where smaller models take everything very literally and are easily confused by suboptimal prompts or unclear instructions.",pcmasterrace,2026-01-20 12:14:08,18,Negative,Neutral,[],Tópico 2

AMD,o0e1xa7,"What kind of PSU does your system have? I would rather not recommend you a GPU that your system won't be able to fully power if possible.

For example, there would be a significant bottleneck for the 5500 paired with a RTX 4070 at 1080p that can be mitigated at a higher resolution (1440p.) If you're fine with upgrading the CPU then I'd recommend a 5700x as it's like $200 USD at moment. The 16Gb of RAM should be fine as damn near every game doesn't need that much RAM; however, there are some exceptions like Battlefield 6 or Hogwarts Legacy that want more. Whether you want to cough up the extra money for (what I think is) total overkill on RAM is something you'll have to decide for yourself.

AMD,o04ph0i,"> The higher clocked non cache CCD makes more sense for non gaming applications on the 9950X3D.  The non cache CCD's clock 2% higher, but vcache usually has at least a 4%+ IPC gain in productivity tasks (sometimes over +25%) on zen 5 and wins easily. It's rare to find anything that the standard CCD can match a vcache CCD in.  That used to be the case on Zen 3 and 4, but Zen 5 both scales more from vcache (in terms of IPC gain) and it no longer has a -220mv voltage restriction since they redesigned the vcache.  Looking at this kind of data, why would you pick the Standard CCD on purpose? Ignore all the games if you want, it's still just better across the board despite the 100mhz clock drop. https://files.catbox.moe/iy5ygj.png  > This means that in gaming you still have to limit the CPU to a single CCD so that means zero improvement in gaming.   It depends on the game, there are a few (e.g. Satisfactory and Riftbreaker) which see significant performance advantages from 2ccd on 9950x3d already - even though the second CCD is weaker, without vcache - which makes it the best CPU for those games. That is particularly the case when using RAM and FCLK OC's. My 2ccd perf on Satisfactory is ~7% higher than second place on the leaderboard because of this scaling.  It's also commonplace to see significant reductions in load time with multi-CCX, and having two CCX's basically cuts shader compilation time and shader compilation stutter in half.",AMD,2026-01-17 16:41:32,4,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.94900143), 'word': 'IP', 'start': 172, 'end': 174}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9865163), 'word': 'Zen 3', 'start': 356, 'end': 361}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.99204606), 'word': 'Zen 5', 'start': 373, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8152712), 'word': 'IP', 'start': 421, 'end': 423}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.70955193), 'word': 'Standard', 'start': 569, 'end': 577}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.7627417), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 902, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.55811834), 'word': 'R', 'start': 919, 'end': 920}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.77143925), 'word': 'FCL', 'start': 1157, 'end': 1160}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.80721897), 'word': 'O', 'start': 1162, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6438485), 'word': 'Sa', 'start': 1184, 'end': 1186}]",Tópico 5
AMD,o04r0j0,All you said is pure speculation and hopeful thoughts. AMD during the 9950X3D release said that a dual cache CCD is not economically viable and with practically no improvements to performance. I take AMD’s words over yours in this case.  It makes no sense for a dual cache CCD in Zen 5 while it will still suffer from latency between the CCD’s. That is not speculation that is a fact.   It looks more like AMD is testing for a dual CCD Zen 6 release which makes more sense because of the latency issues they are resolving in Zen 6.  And if AMD were to actually release a 9950X3D2 then they would have announced it at CES which they did not further proving that it is just an engineering prototype.,AMD,2026-01-17 16:48:41,-3,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9901759), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 55, 'end': 58}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9895371), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 200, 'end': 203}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9773946), 'word': 'Zen 5', 'start': 280, 'end': 285}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9945613), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 406, 'end': 409}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.8706322), 'word': 'Zen 6', 'start': 436, 'end': 441}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9909111), 'word': 'Zen 6', 'start': 525, 'end': 530}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9959426), 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 540, 'end': 543}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.60693526), 'word': 'CES', 'start': 617, 'end': 620}]",Tópico 1

I had to wait a good long time to buy my 9070 XT (XFX Swift Tri-fan) at close to the MSRP--still paid $141 over the $599 MSRP, so I hope AMD will return to the practice of selling its own reference designs, again, so that its customers can purchase them immediately upon availability.

Yes lets excuse a company for a bad product, a lack of investment in software, shit drivers, and lacking support. And zero forward thinking.   Meanwhile the RTX 2080 which released a year earlier for the same price saw a lot longer useful lifespan, feature, and drive support.   And they repeated it again basically pulling the plug on RDNA2 and RDNA3 because they still weren't forward thinking or investing in the right things. But hey it will probably happen to RDNA4 when UDNA rolls around too, so at least they're fair ish in shafting the people that buy their GPUs.   >The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.

AMD,o0bfhj8,"Factorio hates inter-CCX latency, i doubt it would perform better with double zen5 vcache.  A few games like Satisfactory and Riftbreaker already scale positively even though the second CCD doesn't have vcache, so they're good candidates.  Many productivity workloads like 7zip also are, as they scale very well to 2CCX and perform much better on vcache CCD's than standard ones.

AMD,o0du2un,"One of the main changes with AM5 is that every IOD has an iGPU. Guess what circuit the iGPU runs off of? If you guessed SoC, you're correct!  If you use the iGPU as passthrough to dGPU, you definitely should not be running high SoC voltages. Once you transcode videos with iGPU and dGPU together and higher currents start running through SoC, you can pop the circuit.  Honestly, I'd cap the SoC voltage at 1.200V for those users using iGPU as passthrough. Examining CPU failure on ASRock boards had the pads on CPU and terminals on mobo centered around iGPU power rails and SoC.  If you disable the iGPU, it's still present in silicon obviously and tied very closely to IMC, so you still shouldn't push a bunch of voltage through it. iGPU disabled - 1.250V max, IMO, and even that is a little high.  1.300-1.500V SoC should only be used with exotic cooling (LN2) for extreme OC runs. IOD is N7-series (N6), so it can't support high voltages unless transistors are below 0C. Yes, yes, Zen 3 used 1.450V+ on CPU cores, but it's not a constant voltage and algorithms carefully control how long cores stay at such voltages. SoC voltage, when OC is enabled, is often a constant voltage as power saving features are usually disabled. Be careful. IOD silicon is often higher density as well, so heat builds quickly on these transistors (junction temps on power lines). High boosting CPU cores are not as densely packed.  Other probable causes: power/current spikes not being absorbed properly by PSU. Quality PSUs can last a long time and some even have 10 year warranties.

Often it is EDC. So you'd run into scenarios where you're PPT, TDC, and Voltage can't go to 100, because EDC is maxed out.  >PBO Settings with curve offset:   PPT 1000, EDC 1000, TDC 1000, Voltage 85  >This removes the common EDC bottleneck and allows your chip to run faster until some other limit is tripped. Simultaneously, *if you've edited the voltage curve into the negative* you are allowing less voltage to go through, making your chip cooler, so it can boost longer (and higher if you changed that setting too).      Now, where you can potentially run into trouble is with basic physics. PBO removes the upper limits on current (amperage). Even with lower voltages, the amount of electrical power flowing through your chip (wattage) under load can be higher than designed for stock usage. Using the scalar in PBO settings would only amplify this problem too.       This isn't to say it's dangerous for your chip. I am not an electrical engineer, and there are 1000 other factors to consider, when it comes to chip design safety. But PBO is overclocking, and there's a reason you have to agree to a disclaimer to use it in your UEFI.      Generally speaking, PBO might give your CPU a ~5% boost in performance.

AMD,nyti1nf,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".

I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in.

When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,nxu27tg,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,nysqs8m,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

AMD,nxvyiba,"I suspect they just didn't have enough time to change anything. MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable?

Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Here are some examples:   -Intel’s 32nm Sandy Bridge came after the early 32nm CPUs (dual-core i3/i5 300/500 series and the 6-core 980X), and Sandy Bridge turned out to be an excellent overclocker.   -22nm Ivy Bridge and Haswell were mediocre in that regard, while Haswell-E (a more mature implementation) overclocked better. Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,nrd4uj2,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.

AMD,ntzg92j,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?

Specs:  - **CPU**: Intel Core i9-13900K - **Motherboard**: ASUS ROG STRIX Z790-H GAMING WIFI - **RAM**: 32GB (2x16GB) G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB (DDR5-6400 CL32, Model: F5-6400J3239G16GX) - **GPU**: MSI RTX 4090 Gaming X Trio - **Storage (OS Drive)**: Crucial P5 Plus 2TB NVMe SSD - **OS**: Windows 11   This is what I've already tried (everything passed):  *  **Memtest86:** Completed multiple passes with no errors. *  **Prime95 & Intel XTU:** Seems to be stable. *  **FurMark:** GPU stress test is stable. *  **Storage Health:** All drives pass SMART and manufacturer-specific self-tests. *  **System Integrity:** `sfc /scannow` and `DISM /RestoreHealth` complete successfully. *  **Updates:** All drivers, firmware, BIOS, and Windows are fully up-to-date. *  **Physical:** Cleaned the case, re-seated components, and replaced thermal paste. * **XMP**: I've disabled/re-enabled XMP multiple times, doesn't make a difference.  I have trouble finding a consistent way of reproducing the issue. Today I tried a 7-Zip benchmark which failed once with a ""decoding error"", but I wasn't able to reproduce it afterwards. I couldn't get Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool to fail after multiple hours. So...  *   **Is this a memory instability issue?** Could the RAM be faulty?  *   **Or, could this be a faulty CPU core?** I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/15mflva/tech_support13900k_problems_when_using_multiple/) where a user had identical symptoms (CRC/7-Zip errors) that were only resolved by replacing a faulty 13900K, even with XMP off.

I'm not a gamer.  When connecting through the HDMI port on the laptop and monitor, I can't set the resolution to 3440x1440; I can go up to 3840x2160, but not the monitor's native resolution. However, when I connect through the USB-C port on the laptop to the DisplayPort on the monitor, I can set the resolution to 3440x1440 without any issues. The downside is that I've lost the only Thunderbolt port I have available.  Is there a workaround for this issue? If I use an HDMI to DisplayPort adapter, will I be able to set the resolution to 3440x1440?

AMD,nqoo97z,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.

AMD,nvbb6wv,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.  Has anyone had a similar issue and knows the fix? Although I suspect the issue has to be resolved with a driver update.",Intel,2025-12-22 03:46:16,1,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.95836616), 'word': 'Intel ARC', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.87413186), 'word': 'Avatar Frontiers of Pandora', 'start': 176, 'end': 203}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.96036136), 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 940, 'end': 943}]",Tópico 4

AMD,nwenzma,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed.

AMD,nkq87np,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

AMD,nt12wk5,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

AMD,ntz1is6,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Intel,2025-12-14 13:04:59,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.9985821), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 589, 'end': 594}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9987382), 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 638, 'end': 645}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9978817), 'word': 'Final Fantasy XI', 'start': 807, 'end': 823}]",Tópico 5

However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.

AMD,ny5a7jq,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Intel,2026-01-07 04:53:34,1,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.9824144), 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 5, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7468332), 'word': 'Memory', 'start': 55, 'end': 61}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.8209329), 'word': 'ASRock', 'start': 163, 'end': 169}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.6569425), 'word': 'RS', 'start': 180, 'end': 182}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.6424512), 'word': 'T', 'start': 229, 'end': 230}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.7019195), 'word': 'T', 'start': 444, 'end': 445}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': np.float32(0.66540986), 'word': 'Advanced', 'start': 483, 'end': 491}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.920852), 'word': 'ASRock', 'start': 677, 'end': 683}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': np.float32(0.45934322), 'word': 'T', 'start': 796, 'end': 797}]",Tópico 1
