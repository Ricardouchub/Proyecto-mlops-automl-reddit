Intel,ne6dpqm,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.

For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown.

Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro.

Intel,ner4der,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",hardware,2025-09-17 18:50:49,21,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99808574, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 92, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6214537, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 214, 'end': 216}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.52357626, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 913, 'end': 915}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99834645, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 940, 'end': 945}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.83350486, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1015, 'end': 1022}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99116546, 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1092, 'end': 1093}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8770928, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1093, 'end': 1100}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99863094, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1102, 'end': 1107}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9641192, 'word': 'Mediatek', 'start': 1113, 'end': 1121}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9881471, 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1173, 'end': 1174}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96866584, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1174, 'end': 1181}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5841442, 'word': 'ST', 'start': 1207, 'end': 1209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9980452, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1226, 'end': 1231}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99846077, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1255, 'end': 1260}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99331963, 'word': 'Q', 'start': 1354, 'end': 1355}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.81863767, 'word': '##ualcomm', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.89312124, 'word': 'Qualcomm', 'start': 1426, 'end': 1434}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9982552, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1471}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.47448224, 'word': 'Zen', 'start': 1678, 'end': 1681}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9968098, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1743, 'end': 1748}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9972773, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1797, 'end': 1802}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9961228, 'word': 'Apple', 'start': 1836, 'end': 1841}]",Tópico 2

Intel,neuqhpy,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",hardware,2025-09-18 08:30:29,5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.48614332, 'word': 'apple', 'start': 38, 'end': 43}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88643, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 351, 'end': 354}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.604474, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 809, 'end': 811}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.95716006, 'word': 'F', 'start': 913, 'end': 914}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.420649, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1019, 'end': 1021}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4713005, 'word': 'GP', 'start': 1108, 'end': 1110}]",Tópico 1

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Intel,n18i4wk,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear.

You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them.

Intel,mt9r3r7,"The question is less about stability and more about support.  AMD's ROCm support is basically on a per-chip basis. If you have gfx1100 (navi31) on Linux you're basically have good (not perfect) support and most things work (especially over the past year - bitsandbytes, AOTriton, even CK now works. I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.  I think the real question you should ask is what price point and hardware class are you looking for and what kind of support do you need (if you just need llama.cpp to run, then either is fine, tbt).",hardware,2025-05-20 10:05:09,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99432874, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 62, 'end': 65}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.91649216, 'word': 'Linux', 'start': 147, 'end': 152}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.602572, 'word': 'C', 'start': 285, 'end': 286}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87090975, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 364, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9901792, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 373, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.4972036, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 436, 'end': 438}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.54296345, 'word': 'St', 'start': 538, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5218894, 'word': 'P', 'start': 613, 'end': 614}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.65743005, 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 615, 'end': 618}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9969369, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 703, 'end': 708}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9419639, 'word': 'IP', 'start': 711, 'end': 713}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6649344, 'word': '##EX', 'start': 713, 'end': 715}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8098178, 'word': 'LL', 'start': 716, 'end': 718}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.78730804, 'word': 'Vulkan', 'start': 1057, 'end': 1063}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7581238, 'word': 'SYCL', 'start': 1064, 'end': 1068}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99012405, 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1106, 'end': 1109}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8630128, 'word': 'IPEX', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1165}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7422742, 'word': 'LL', 'start': 1166, 'end': 1168}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.92667025, 'word': 'IMO', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1268}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6407584, 'word': 'IP', 'start': 1327, 'end': 1329}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.66652775, 'word': '##EX', 'start': 1329, 'end': 1331}]",Tópico 2

Intel,mt4vsoz,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",hardware,2025-05-19 15:23:10,12,Negative,Disgust,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87045366, 'word': 'A', 'start': 9, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8757272, 'word': 'Alchemist', 'start': 492, 'end': 501}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4702369, 'word': 'Battlemage', 'start': 580, 'end': 590}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9827648, 'word': 'LL', 'start': 666, 'end': 668}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.75775045, 'word': 'Flash Attention', 'start': 892, 'end': 907}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99654156, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 911, 'end': 916}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9984048, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1126, 'end': 1131}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7069878, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1250, 'end': 1251}]",Tópico 2

Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates.

Intel,n7ismbe,You have a very narrow vision of speed. What you are saying is like your truck is faster than my audi because it has more horsepower. Nvidia is the top dog right now but that doesn't mean you get more from nvidia for 200$. VRAM size and speed is something you cannot ignore. If you have to load half of the model to system memory it is gonna decrease your speed significantly. And guess what? If you can't fit the model into your memory you won't be running it even if you have a billion cuda cores. This is why intel is offering 24GB VRAM for 500$ while you need to pay 2500$ for the same VRAM size in nvidia (rtx a5000 for example).,buildapc,2025-08-08 01:06:31,0,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.75558484, 'word': 'N', 'start': 134, 'end': 135}]",Tópico 4

Intel,n4j4ewg,"Driver support in games is very good these days, I have had considerably more issues on my NVIDIA PC than on my arc PC, over the last six months or so (I've also used that one more but still felt like a worse overall experience in terms of gaming drivers). Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch.

If Intel actually managed to execute and follow their initial roadmap and release Alchemist GPUs during the COVID pandemic we'd probably be looking at a very different Intel GPU division but here we are now.,pcmasterrace,2025-09-18 22:37:35,4,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9989725, 'word': 'Intel Arc', 'start': 30, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.719991, 'word': 'B', 'start': 102, 'end': 103}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.999035, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 186, 'end': 191}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9988249, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 328, 'end': 333}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.98490477, 'word': 'Al', 'start': 407, 'end': 409}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9555709, 'word': 'CO', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9920374, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 493, 'end': 498}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84644955, 'word': '##U', 'start': 501, 'end': 502}]",Tópico 5

Intel,ndc08oa,"So this is the Intel Arc B50. It's an *extremely* power limited BMG-G21 with only 16 Xe2 cores (B580 has 20) and only a 128 bit memory bus, limiting memory performance to just 224 GB/s: B580 has 456 GB/s.  To get power down to 70 watts and be slot powered, it has utterly castrated the BMG-G21. Only 4 MB L2 cache is enabled (of the 18 MB on the silicon) and it runs 1,000 MHz slower than it does in B580. Some sources claim 8 MB L2 is enabled, so this appears to be a bit unsure at the moment. It's not remotely B580's 18 MB and Intel's dGPU caching architecture is still a train wreck from its IGP origins.  What Intel has done is given it a similar memory config to AMD's 7600XT, 128 bit GDDR6 and 16 GB of it and cut the BMG-G21 down so far it can barely do anything. It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.  It could potentially be useful for AI, since Battlemage has strong INT8 performance, hobbyist level AI is all about CUDA and PyTorch. PyTorch will run on AMD fairly well, but Intel has pretty shit compatibility here and the card's performance will be inadequate for anyone wanting to play games on it.

Engineering and architecture workstations are about rasterisation performance. The designs and drawings have to be rendered quickly and smoothly on your two 4K monitors, which a stripped back and power-throttled 70 watt BMG-G21 isn't going to do.  For very entry level visualisation, we use RX 7600XTs with 16 GB, they have AutoDesk and Bentley certified drivers and enough VRAM and rasterisation to handle it. The RTX 4060 Ti isn't that bad there either, again you need the 16 GB version. On the next refresh of the low end workstations, they're probably going to end up being 9060XT and 5060Tis. Both of those would smash this little thing silly.  To that, I'm not sure who Intel wants to sell this to. $350 isn't serious money and it's competing with gaming-intended GPUs (which are utterly fine for visualisation and design) of much higher performance. It doesn't have substantially more RAM than competing products, it doesn't ECC protect the RAM and workstations generally don't care for slot powered cards either way.

Under Windows it has kernel-level ARM to x86/64 translation for Windows binaries. Compatibility is pretty decent but it’s hard to tell under gaming since there’s no GPU drivers for anything but embedded ARM graphics.  Under Linux, it’s a totally different story. You have Box64 and FEX-EMU. I switched to all ARM years ago but it came with a learning curve. Compared to three years ago, there’s many high performance games and performance reaches about 50-70% of native x86 performance.

Intel,m84i6ct,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",AMD,2025-01-20 06:59:20,20,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96047413, 'word': 'Arc B580', 'start': 12, 'end': 20}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97551155, 'word': 'R', 'start': 38, 'end': 39}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.47393385, 'word': '##zen 7', 'start': 40, 'end': 45}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9978709, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 330, 'end': 335}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9221623, 'word': 'R', 'start': 539, 'end': 540}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9936434, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 812, 'end': 817}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.70016813, 'word': 'DX11', 'start': 830, 'end': 834}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.99374455, 'word': 'D', 'start': 838, 'end': 839}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.97952205, 'word': 'D', 'start': 871, 'end': 872}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.996042, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 888, 'end': 893}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9800243, 'word': 'D', 'start': 923, 'end': 924}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9670311, 'word': 'D', 'start': 943, 'end': 944}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9871013, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1037, 'end': 1038}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9752412, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1074, 'end': 1075}]",Tópico 2

If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad.

Intel,lukp0ww,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Intel,lem77tu,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",AMD,2024-07-23 22:13:57,0,Neutral,Joy,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9922133, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 45, 'end': 50}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6682615, 'word': 'ARC', 'start': 68, 'end': 71}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99653184, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.86584127, 'word': 'Di', 'start': 355, 'end': 357}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.64568275, 'word': 'Port', 'start': 363, 'end': 367}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.90114915, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 376, 'end': 378}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87513644, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 406, 'end': 408}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8040758, 'word': 'HD', 'start': 433, 'end': 435}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7500115, 'word': '680', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8380654, 'word': 'X', 'start': 511, 'end': 512}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8164692, 'word': 'Frog Pursuit', 'start': 684, 'end': 696}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.88147104, 'word': 'Blu', 'start': 839, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9793236, 'word': 'Buster', 'start': 844, 'end': 850}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9005273, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 911, 'end': 913}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.69748294, 'word': '680', 'start': 929, 'end': 932}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.58866495, 'word': 'VI', 'start': 1028, 'end': 1030}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.511351, 'word': '680', 'start': 1142, 'end': 1145}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99225956, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1193, 'end': 1198}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.80401796, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1265, 'end': 1267}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7076516, 'word': 'AR', 'start': 1372, 'end': 1374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.88741785, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1457, 'end': 1460}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5076931, 'word': 'AM', 'start': 1568, 'end': 1570}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7363588, 'word': 'Arc', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9888704, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1705, 'end': 1710}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99029034, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 1887, 'end': 1892}]",Tópico 1

Intel,kxi9i5m,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",AMD,2024-04-01 05:48:52,67,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.98579425, 'word': 'Windows', 'start': 202, 'end': 209}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6807291, 'word': 'CUDA', 'start': 279, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.53338933, 'word': 'Ren', 'start': 363, 'end': 366}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8288868, 'word': 'DirectML', 'start': 466, 'end': 474}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8976541, 'word': 'P', 'start': 552, 'end': 553}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.87239146, 'word': '##Tor', 'start': 554, 'end': 557}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.87449735, 'word': '##ML', 'start': 652, 'end': 654}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.52110374, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 829, 'end': 830}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.63087755, 'word': 'Z', 'start': 861, 'end': 862}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9507805, 'word': 'C', 'start': 905, 'end': 906}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5053189, 'word': '##DA', 'start': 907, 'end': 909}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8337852, 'word': 'NVIDIA', 'start': 1133, 'end': 1139}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.69437224, 'word': 'CU', 'start': 1161, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.5678201, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1216, 'end': 1217}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6214103, 'word': 'C', 'start': 1300, 'end': 1301}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6280626, 'word': 'GPU', 'start': 1332, 'end': 1335}]",Tópico 4

Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

Intel,kxnqc72,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..

Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.

Intel,kxjknpx,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,kxhlmwx,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo.

Intel,kxmam0y,"AMD's reputation on VDI seems to be a dumpster fire in homelab scene despite having the first SR-IOV implementation compared to Nvidia and Intel(yes, even Intel is into VDI market!). Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

Intel,kxjq477,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.

How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  My aging 5700 XT crashes in games far less often than my friends who are on various Nvidia cards from 2080 Ti to 4090.  Same for when I was on Polarix with RX 470s.  Game crashes are rarely the fault of the graphics driver (or hardware), regardless of brand.  This isn't a good point to be making, because it's just wrong.  > suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality  This again?  No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",AMD,2024-04-02 04:23:59,-2,Negative,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7806482, 'word': 'N', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.49206084, 'word': '##vid', 'start': 290, 'end': 293}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.59018177, 'word': 'T', 'start': 312, 'end': 313}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8755103, 'word': 'Polarix', 'start': 348, 'end': 355}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.96025205, 'word': 'R', 'start': 361, 'end': 362}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7545489, 'word': 'PSP', 'start': 567, 'end': 570}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.4970201, 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 631, 'end': 633}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.4853362, 'word': '##on VII', 'start': 635, 'end': 641}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.808714, 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 652, 'end': 656}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.85674083, 'word': 'Vega', 'start': 900, 'end': 904}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.7854365, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 994, 'end': 997}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.66929066, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1134, 'end': 1137}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8934808, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1491, 'end': 1494}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.96433926, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1627, 'end': 1630}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.80651146, 'word': 'George', 'start': 1813, 'end': 1819}]",Tópico 2

It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.

With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

Intel,k773lbl,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?

DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",AMD,2023-10-30 21:15:25,-5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.949649, 'word': 'Alan Wake', 'start': 0, 'end': 9}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.91378605, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 69, 'end': 73}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7303601, 'word': 'DLAA', 'start': 109, 'end': 113}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9975333, 'word': 'Digital Foundry', 'start': 732, 'end': 747}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.84053415, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 1406, 'end': 1409}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6853485, 'word': 'DLSS', 'start': 1702, 'end': 1706}]",Tópico 4

Intel,jwv9n3n,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.

Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff.

Intel,jwwhi65,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",AMD,2023-08-19 19:51:52,1,Neutral,Sadness,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9452912, 'word': 'Lenovo', 'start': 223, 'end': 229}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8261307, 'word': 'Hogwartz', 'start': 805, 'end': 813}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9086967, 'word': 'Rachet', 'start': 815, 'end': 821}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.6654186, 'word': 'Clank', 'start': 826, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.72740483, 'word': 'Re', 'start': 833, 'end': 835}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8370989, 'word': '2', 'start': 841, 'end': 842}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9770279, 'word': 'O', 'start': 1466, 'end': 1467}]",Tópico 2

The only benefit from strix halo is offering lots of relatively fast ram but performance really lacks behind nvidia and Apples offers.  Why exactly don't Digits Spark or Jetson count?    You're throwing both development work on LLMs (professional workload) and consumers (which you cannot define?   NVIDIAs jetsons can be used as a desktop PC with Linux it and they can even run games. But Software support can still be an issue in some, especially windows. But that's why nvidia announced x86 versions literally today.   Most LLM devs run hardware like this as servers anyway. There is no point in giving each developer its own training system. And most want to LLMs on Linux but still use Windows for their desktop.   But yes, for people who only want one system, do heavy llm development but don't care that much about performance and don't mind having their desktop system doing the heavy work all the time, can only run Windows but don't mind paying a lot of money, Strix Halo is the only option.

AMD,nedgds6,"One out of three. Yep interesting and overlooked. I also wondered why I couldn't find L1 cache numbers for RDNA4 anywhere but in hindsight it's obvious.  L1 is per Shader Array (half WGP partition of a Shader Engine) not WGP.  L2 cache redesign is more aimed towards negating the 384 -> 256 bit MC config from 7900 XTX -> 9070 XT. 9070 XT Infinity cache is so fast that the effective BW is actually higher than 7900 XTX's despite -33% lower mem BW.  Oh for sure. The L1 was never a good design. Probably tons of cache thrashing due to small size, it really wasn't that much bigger than LDS, pre RDNA 3 it was actually the same size as one WGP LDS. Crazy to think about a mid level cache shared by 5 WGPs only having the same cache size as one LDS!  >I suspect that AMD would increase the LDS (AMD now calls it ""shared memory"" like Nvidia) to 192kb or 256kb and give it shared L1 cache functionality.

AMD,nej571c,Agreed which is why I compared it with NVIDIA's implementation. MALL was never really more than a victim cache and a memory BW multiplier.   Yep 100%. IIRC AMD stated doubled L2 in RDNA 4 was for RT performance.  They might have some interesting tech in RDNA 5 for that. I saw a patent that prevented cache thrashing. It applied to L1 not L2 but can't see why they shouldn't do that for L2 in RDNA 5 as well. with 64MB -> 24MB cache rumoured for 9070XT to AT2 you would want the most important data in L2 and avoid cache thrashing whenever possible.

AMD,nej9td6,100%. Neural rendering and neural everything really. That is what makes the CPX = 6090 speculation interesting. Seems far fetched but it's still possible. Guess we'll have to wait for GTC 2026 on that one though. No real specs for CPX rn.  RDNA 5 is as co-design between Sony and AMD and it's pretty much guaranteed that there's a heavy focus on AI and RT. Watch the PS5 Pro december coverage around SIE presentation by Cerny and DF interview. The guy is all in on ML and RT. He dictates what Sony gets in PS6 and AMD will have to match that whether they like it or not.    Raster is solved so Sony would rather gimp that by 15-20% and invest heavily in RT and ML than waste all silicon on raster. Nothing is confirmed though but they can't rely on raw perf anymore. PS6 can only differentiate itself on features so that's what they'll push.  RDNA 4 has eq. TFLOPs ML perf compared to NVIDIA. Look at the specs sheet of a 4080 vs 9070XT. Only thing missing is FP4 to compete with 50 series but nextgen will have that. But if CPX is indeed 6090 die then RDNA 5 stands no chance against 60 series in ML performance.,hardware,2025-09-16 14:57:30,2,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.82907385, 'word': 'CPX', 'start': 76, 'end': 79}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.66218317, 'word': 'GTC', 'start': 184, 'end': 187}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6833601, 'word': 'CPX', 'start': 231, 'end': 234}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.85411817, 'word': 'RDNA', 'start': 240, 'end': 244}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.5565898, 'word': '5', 'start': 245, 'end': 246}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9984016, 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 271, 'end': 275}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.98978806, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 280, 'end': 283}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.56901854, 'word': 'AI', 'start': 346, 'end': 348}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9871753, 'word': 'PS5 Pro', 'start': 367, 'end': 374}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.89584, 'word': 'S', 'start': 400, 'end': 401}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.7946274, 'word': 'Cern', 'start': 420, 'end': 424}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8994377, 'word': 'DF', 'start': 430, 'end': 432}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.997276, 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 493, 'end': 497}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.542561, 'word': 'PS6', 'start': 506, 'end': 509}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9862382, 'word': 'AMD', 'start': 514, 'end': 517}, {'entity_group': 'PER', 'score': 0.7152238, 'word': 'Ra', 'start': 574, 'end': 576}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9977303, 'word': 'Sony', 'start': 594, 'end': 598}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.4199349, 'word': 'R', 'start': 654, 'end': 655}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.52644295, 'word': 'PS', 'start': 767, 'end': 769}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.46573815, 'word': '##6', 'start': 769, 'end': 770}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.79190665, 'word': 'RDNA', 'start': 843, 'end': 847}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.47094533, 'word': '4', 'start': 848, 'end': 849}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.8550028, 'word': 'N', 'start': 885, 'end': 886}, {'entity_group': 'LOC', 'score': 0.70264715, 'word': '##VI', 'start': 886, 'end': 888}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.58100873, 'word': 'CP', 'start': 1025, 'end': 1027}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.959628, 'word': 'RDNA 5', 'start': 1053, 'end': 1059}]",Tópico 4

AMD,ndett58,"Okay so a few corrections because your understanding of the situation is totally off: the driver isn't doing a DLL swap currently for FSR4. It's actually the FSR3.1 SDK that's implemented in the game that's doing the swap. Also one more correction: ALL FSR 3.1 games use a DLL. The only thing that isn't standard is the use of the AMD provided and signed DLL. But all 85-ish games mentioned in the article here still use the signed FSR3.1 DLLs. The blacklist for FSR4 is empty now: now all titles that have the official, signed FSR3.1 DLL can be upgraded.   The FSR3.1 SDK has a function included that checks to see if the driver has allowed an FSR4 upgrade for a specific title (and setting the option in Adrenaline will toggle this value). If the FSR3.1 SDK sees that value sets, it grabs the FSR4 DLL from the driver files directly, and uses that instead. FYI, this is also why FSR4 can be injected on Linux in exactly the same fashion - Proton supports setting this registry key that indicates whether an FSR4 upgrade is possible or not. Currently, Adrenaline does not let you toggle this value to enable the FSR4 upgrade for titles that use a non-signed version of FSR3.1 - so if a developer makes a couple of small changes or tweaks to the FSR3.1 SDK and/or just decides to compile their own DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade will not be an option in that title (at least, at the moment).  However, members of the Optiscaler Discord have tested that if you replace a game's non-signed FSR3.1 DLL with the signed official DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade toggle does appear in Adrenaline.   > Important note - FSR 4 is not compatible with FSR 3.1 titles that run on the Vulkan® API or use non-standard methods of integration of FSR 3.1 into their games, such as using third-party plug-ins or methods that do not use the signed FSR 3.1 DLL.  > In short, some devs shipped unsigned FSR 3.1 DLLs from older plugin versions and FSR4 won't support that.   > Easy fix that should work - replace the FSR 3.1 DLL with the signed one from FFX SDK 1.1.4/FSR 3.1.4  This is actually something AMD could do in the way Nvidia does with DLSS4 DLL swapping in their driver as an experimental feature. But this only affects a handful of UE5 titles, to my understanding.

No you are confusing things. Apple core can only run one thread at a time. It doesn't have SMT. Apple core uses extreme ILP (instruction level parallelism) to take advantage of the width of the core but you can't have multiple logical threads use the core without context switching.  > 1T doesn't take the full width of the architecture that's why they focus so much on making sure branch prediction is the best in the world.  This is wrong as well. An advanced branch predictor is far more important to the performance of the long pipeline cores such as Zen or Intel P cores.

From a pure performance standpoint single threaded performance is only part of the story. And once you do a benchmark across OS and architecture there are a lot more variables in play.

AMD,ndvgjlu,"> Your assumption here seems to be that Apple chips have terrible latency.  No idea where you got that impression from. I never implied anything about the latency of Apple chips.  AMD and Intel do everything to minimize memory latency on the desktop, even at a price of increased idle power draw and temps. This doesn't hinge on whether the chip itself has high or low inherent latency. In fact the chiplet design of the Ryzen is known for poor latency.

I mean.. they have M chips in the IPad Pro already with less cores and I don't see how you can get much lighter or thinner in any meaningful way. Cutting out another core or two doesn't really make a difference in terms of direct weight loss since the cores don't really weigh much. I'm assuming you mean since it has less cores they could design it with fewer thermals in mind and overall less weight because of reduced thermal management system. They can and already do that with the M chips. They will simply thermal throttle at different workload lengths.  I guess what we each call 'significant' in terms of weight in this context is pretty subjective.

AMD,ndodhv2,"> 3D Rendering can be equally done on the GPU, there is no justification to run that on the CPU.  Yes there is, when your scene doesn’t fit in VRAM. No, this is not a hypothetical niche case. GPU rendering is not adopted in many film workflows because of VRAM issues. In many cases, GPU renderers have additional feature limitations, ex, in Blender you can’t run custom OSL shaders when using GPU rendering on macOS (choosing macOS here because that’s a platform where VRAM limits don’t apply due to the unified memory)  > The issue is that not all Cinema4D Projects will be identical in performance, there are massive differences between projects (just see more extensive Blender tests, for each project the relative performance differs).  For the most part, these differences are consistent from processor to processor and are mostly the result of the number of computations the scene needs, not different workloads. Ex, if scene A is 30% slower than scene B on processor X, it tends to also be 30% slower on processor Y.  > The Benchmark itself is designed to exclude all other aspects like RAM speed and Cache which makes it purely synthetic. The only reason to run renders on the CPU instead of GPU are projects that exceed your GPUs RAM capacity. But then, Cinebench doesn't tell you anything.  No, that’s just the workload CPU render engines present. I’m sorry if my job does not tax the hardware subsystem you wish it did, but that’s the way it is. Cinebench is quite frankly an excellent proxy for 3D render performance in general, as your remaining paragraphs explain quite well.  If you don’t care about 3D render performance, that’s fine.

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz.

But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron.

AMD,nd367aj,"Non existent.  That was a thing about a decade ago.  First of all, Intel can still produce in different nodes.  Intel had the problem that they developed both architectures and process nodes together which both had advantages and disadvantages.  You can’t just switch out the process node for an architecture, every architecture is designed for some nodes specifications. The more you focus on one node the better you can use its advantages which is one of the reasons why Intel was typically superior with their chips. But that also comes with drawbacks like Intels 10nm issues.  Intel didn’t stay with basically Kaby lake for years because they wanted to but because they couldn’t switch to ice lake without the 10nm node. And that’s the reason why Intel fell back on the desktop and servers. If you look at their roadmaps, what became Tiger lake H was supposed to come out as Ice lake in like 2018. But with Rocket Lake they backported Ice lake to 14nm which worked more or less well, depending on who you ask. Since then, Intel developed their Architectures with no specific node in mind which makes them as flexible as any fabless company.   I’d say if anything it’s a huge advantage to have your own fabs today because you can determine how much volume you want for yourself.  TSMC is basically a monopoly at that point which also means that all three, NVIDIA, AMD and Intel compete over capacities and that drives up cost.  And then there is Apple.

For example, AMD has shown flexibility in the past, like when they re-lithographed Polaris (RX 580 → RX 590 on 12nm). Would that kind of move count as being “not node tied”? * And for Intel specifically, how should we think about this?

AMD,ndi48ri,"It becomes very specific to the design, any performance changes and the limits of parallelism.   Adding more cores to a single threaded workload will not improve performance.   Adding a larger cache may. Density should help there.   Memories can really benefit from a die shrink because in theory you can have the same design with minor updates just smaller. Then you can have more dies, or arrays of memory cells.   Designs that have multiple dies also have special trade offs in that area. It gets very technical.   Thermal considerations also are really part of this. Many devices are now thermally limited so whatever process reduces heat or helps extract that heat to the cooling design has an impact.   But some designs/workloads are not as effected by this.

(Discord overlay, browser tabs, recording software, etc.)? - Check CPU/GPU temps while gaming with something like HWInfo. - Is the GPU running at expected speed and power consumption under load, or stuck at very low speeds? - what about the CPU? - have you tried a cpu and GPU benchmark like cinebench or furmark, respectively? Are scores in line with those from other users with the same processor and GPU, respectively? -  What resolution are you running the games at (1080p, 1440p, 4K)? - what about graphics settings for those games? - Is XMP/EXPO profile enabled in BIOS so the DDR5 actually runs at 6000 MHz? - Is the game installed on an SSD or HDD?

Also, regarding the PSU - PCPartpicker states that your estimated wattage is around 400W, so I think a 750W PSU is sufficient.

Depends on your definition of motion clarity.       If you mean it as just the amount of image persistence based eye tracking motion blur. Then yes, you have a point as they already have 1ms persistence backlight strobbing LCDs. You can even go sub millisecond if you play around with the strobn duty cycle length, Which would already beat a 1000Hz sample and hold monitor in the race for the lowest image persistence)  If you mean motion clarity in a more encompassing way though. Then no. Because the 1000Hz monitor will have shorter stroboscopic steps on relative motions making the motion look more natural for any motion that happens relative to your eyes position.  The ideal ""retina"" refresh rate saturates each pixel described by the motion. Which for fast paced games would already easily justify 10KHz+. So we're still far away from the end goal of a refresh rate high enough for motion to look on a screen just like it does when we look at real physical objects moving.",pcmasterrace,2025-09-15 22:33:31,6,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9418053, 'word': 'B', 'start': 629, 'end': 630}]",Tópico 4

An MS dev created a project called Oasis which replaces the Windows MR stuff that MS removed when they decided to kill everyone's expensive hardware!

AMD,neiyqqq,On RDNA 3 cards at 4K quality the difference between FSR 3 and FSR 4 is very small. 5% difference in performance. Only when doing 1080P Performance mode is it not as good. But seriously next to nobody is running 540P res upscaling anyways but its still better than native even at that low of a res.

But if you care about esports gaming you’ll mainly want to pay attention to 1% fps lows. Good news is that the lows also are helped out lots by the cache. I get 1% lows always above my monitor’s 390 hz refresh rate so I’m a happy camper.",AMD,2025-09-15 21:49:23,1,Positive,Neutral,[],Tópico 4

I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.

The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.

AMD,nb5mwcf,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,nanj5h3,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles.

Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work. Similarly to DIMM, the CPU still has to support a feature, so don't expect things like MRDIMMs to suddenly work on consumer hardware.",Intel,2025-05-21 00:03:20,5,Neutral,Neutral,"[{'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.94555026, 'word': 'DD', 'start': 8, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9829941, 'word': 'D', 'start': 74, 'end': 75}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.99797136, 'word': 'Intel', 'start': 133, 'end': 138}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6774352, 'word': 'MR', 'start': 158, 'end': 160}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.81876713, 'word': 'D', 'start': 221, 'end': 222}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9339742, 'word': 'D', 'start': 238, 'end': 239}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.6478347, 'word': 'D', 'start': 398, 'end': 399}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.91194916, 'word': 'DD', 'start': 581, 'end': 583}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.9930845, 'word': 'MoBos', 'start': 760, 'end': 765}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.8977657, 'word': 'DD', 'start': 805, 'end': 807}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.44400558, 'word': 'D', 'start': 865, 'end': 866}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.54618526, 'word': 'EC', 'start': 1124, 'end': 1126}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.40115422, 'word': 'LP', 'start': 1199, 'end': 1201}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.9122287, 'word': 'LP', 'start': 1240, 'end': 1242}, {'entity_group': 'ORG', 'score': 0.57948995, 'word': 'D', 'start': 1281, 'end': 1282}, {'entity_group': 'MISC', 'score': 0.45339322, 'word': 'MR', 'start': 1355, 'end': 1357}]",Tópico 1
