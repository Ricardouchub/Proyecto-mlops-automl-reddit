Intel,"I recently picked up an MSI Claw 7 AI+, and have been pleasantly surprised with the current state of their drivers. I would absolutely be interested in a Celestial GPU if they have anything targeting 9070~ or higher performance level. Here's hoping!",Positive
Intel,I'm glad they are doing these followup videos. Gotta give Intel credit where due - their cards are getting so much better over time.,Positive
Intel,The Lunar Lake handhelds would be really popular if they were just a little cheaper.,Positive

Intel,"They usually do tho? We dont know about their dGPUs yet because it hasn't been 5 years.  Their Xe Laptop gpus are 5years+ and are supported as of this month.  No idea why you're hating on intel GPUs mate, i'm used to everyone cheering the underdog not the otherway around.",Neutral
Intel,"I think that guy's a misinformed user that is saying that AMD 5000/6000 series won't get driver updates anymore lol, when AMD just said that those gens aren't slated for game optimizations that use their ""latest technologies"" (FSR4 at the time of writing) anymore. Those gens still will get driver updates but AMD gave up on trying to implement FSR4 on them, like the leaked scripts earlier this year had performance reduction from 20% to up to 30% FPS to use FSR4 for 6000 series cards since they don't have the hardware and just using brute force software for FSR4.   I'd agree that my 6700 XT never getting FSR4 sucks, but the misinfo circling around is that we'd never get anymore driver updates lol.",Negative
Intel,"so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding? and they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name? … but Xe3 plus will be enough to call it C series.",Neutral
Intel,"I loved how Tom Peterson did the circuit of tech blogs, tubers, and related last Fall to announce and advocate for ARC Battlemage.  Looking forward to seeing alot of him over the next few months for Xe3 and ARC C-series",Positive
Intel,Everything about Celestial I've heard seems to be regarding mobile. Is there actually going to be dedicated discrete graphics?,Neutral
Intel,The Intel driver downloading a shader cache for games from Intel sounds very noteworthy.   I'm really skeptical tying GPU drivers to a manufacturer's online service.,Neutral
Intel,"They don't care. These will be mid tier chips at best. The RTX IGPU ones will be their flagships. These are still damn impressive though, just have to make that clear.",Negative
Intel,"The mega brains of this community really struggle with product naming lol, its so funny to watch supposed intelligent people straight faced say they can't work out what product out 6 to buy because of their product names, most of them are in different market segments so you can't even accidentally buy the wrong one.",Negative
Intel,"They may divide ABC depending on ISA/hardware capabilities used for example. Like AMD used ""RDNA 3.5"" on mobile as full RDNA 4 would pull more power due to more silicon dedicated to AI (including FSR 4 -\_-). RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4. So Xe 3B will be better than current but Xe 3C will do better at DXR and/or AI frame gen/whatever new tech they added.",Neutral

Thinks of it as Xe2.5 but for some reason marketing is calling it Xe3.",Positive
Intel,">they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name?      No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral
Intel,An alternative explanation could also be that Celestial dGPUs *are* launching as Xe3P and they would want the launch of C series iGPU and dGPU to be around the same time and the same architecture.,Neutral
Intel,">so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding?  Wasnt it always so? Xe is the architectural names, ABC was just branding for customers.",Neutral
Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.  They are excellent value products that would allow Intel to get a chunk of that market, given they are available in sufficient quantities at intended price points.",Positive
Intel,Is shader caching on first use a real problem? Sounds like bored people needing something to cry about again.,Negative
Intel,>RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4  Do you have a source for this? I vaguely remember 3.5 wasn't really bringing particular changes,Neutral
Intel,That's exactly what everyone's new GPU generation is.  An entirely new architecture is extremely rare for any company.,Neutral
Intel,That's not what Peterson was talking about context wise when he addressed this in the video.,Negative
Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,"There are more to that, if you look at RDNA 4 and blackwell for example they had changes to the SMs, enc/dec, etc.   Here it using basically the same cores, but changes are made to better utilize those cores. I think this sentence summarize it the best:  ""Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products"".  Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware. By going this route the basically giving pretty good improvement only year after initial release with basically almost the same drivers. It's just not a new generation but something in the middle between a refresh and a new generation.",Neutral
Intel,"Not rare, but more like it only happens when there's a paradigm shift in graphics that necessitates it.   GCN -> RDNA or Pascal -> Ampere are the most recent ones.",Neutral
Intel,"its not extremely rare. It happens once every 7-10 years or so when they redesign it for significant changes. but yeah, most generations will be refinement.",Neutral
Intel,"In the end it is all matter of marketing, filter it for a moment and understand what it's. As he said ""leverage all the good work from battlemage"". As I read it and looking the architecture it's battlemage with some enhancement that will come to future product celestial. Something like RDNA 3.5. I think they messed up the naming - they want to present it as something new and different (it's in some aspects) but it's not the real next gen in their roadmap.",Neutral
Intel,By discrete iam assuming you mean client graphics SoCs? The margins are not enough on those - you make much more money on Pro cards/ HPC.,Negative
Intel,"No this is not the case. The decision is purely branding. Xe3 and Xe3P are part of the same generation architecture wise unlike Xe2 and Battlemage, he addressed this.",Neutral
Intel,It's this. IGPU's will be for gamers and DGPU for data center. They basically both have said this :) People just don't notice anything. What do folks think RTX IGPU's on intel chips are gonna be for. LIKE LOL!,Neutral
Intel,"Then why he said ""when we move to our next architecture...""? Meaning they are not the same (Xe3 and Xe3P), also look at the slide they're grouping Xe2 with Xe3 under battlemage.  What you say contradicts their statements, and the article. The decision is of course marketing but nowhere they say Xe3 and Xe3P share the same architecture. This is why I said before it should've been called Xe2.5 or something of that sort like with RDNA 3.5.",Neutral
Intel,Next architecture is just rearrangement of existing cores into more effective set up. No contradictions.,Neutral
Intel,"When we will see deep dive into X3P celestial we will see what have changed. Until then it's just speculation of the differences between Xe3 and Xe3P. My bet there will be more changes than mere ""rearrangement of existing cores"".",Neutral
Intel,"Love a good TAP interview, hopefully he'll do some podcasts too once the embargo lifts.",Positive
Intel,"I like how TAP said ""expect even bigger investments in graphics in the future"". I hope this means what I think it means, because Intel \*must\* continue heavy investment in their own graphics. Accelerated compute is the future.",Positive
Intel,MLID must have an aneurysm seeing the guy still employed at Intel,Negative
Intel,"Tom's an absolute gem. It's so frustrating to see the most passionate and effective communicators locked up behind embargoes and NDAs, so fingers crossed that this marks the next wave of tech exploration and deep dives. Always nice to see him pop up in a random GN or PC World video.  Credit where it's due, Lex (Alejandro) has also always been attentive and forthcoming in his Reddit interactions, even factoring in the usual embargo/NDA constraints.

Intel,Igpus not discrete gpus,Neutral
Intel,"I would not attempt to read much into claims like that. This is marketing, not an investment roadmap. I'm sure if you pressed them on it, the lawyers would have some words.   Remember, they've yet to even *talk* about dGPUs past BMG. And the big-iGPU NVL is reportedly cancelled (likely in favor of the Nvidia partnership).",Negative
Intel,Hahaha I can hear Tom saying “fucking Tom Peterson has been *lying* to you” as you say that,Negative
Intel,Problem is we don't know the real roadmap is for Intel. I really want them to put out a roadmap like they used to. But things in flux probably :s.,Negative
Intel,I think only way for intel to enter consumer GPU space is to start via iGPU at this point.  They just need to make bigger faster iGPU to make Nvidia RTX xx50/RTX xx60 redundant.,Neutral
Intel,I don't think partnership Nvidia iGPUs will be ready until TTL/HML circa 2029/2030.,Neutral
Intel,"Agreed, but then similarly I would also not attempt to conjecture on their roadmap outside of an investment roadmap... lack of a public roadmap update on graphics in a while is certainly saying something by not saying anything, but it's also not saying cancellations, etc...",Negative
Intel,There are just too many Toms in tech media. Tom of Moore's Law is Dead needs to thin out the competition.,Negative
Intel,I don't think even Intel knows what the real roadmap is anymore. They're so far behind on the previous ones that it's not surprising that they're not releasing new ones.,Negative
Intel,We are not competing with higher end GPUs. It seems they want to capture the budget segment and then move up the ladder.  But I don't like that iGPUs has more priority than dGPUs. Hope celestial comes into life in future,Negative
Intel,"Probably, but no sense offering an in-house big iGPU for just one gen. It needs to be a long-term commitment.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, the layoffs tell a story. The dGPU group, and client graphics SoC in general, was gutted even before Lip Bu came on. To say it's likely a skeleton crew is probably doing it a favor.",Negative

Intel,"You think Intel is going to maintain these footholds any longer than they would need to?  This push of their dedicated GPUs into the professional space, is just a mere attempt to get rid of the unsold inventory of ARC-GPUs at the highest possible price-tag right from the beginning – Dumping those into the enterprise- and datacenter-space, in noble hope that someone clueless might bite upon the Intel-brand, and then dip into it at high costs *at non-existing support software-support* Intel pretends to deliver some time in the future.

Intel,"Even the fancy NVIDIA interconnects are a bottleneck for training performance, as are the memory bandwidth and even L2 bandwidth. One architects the algorithm around that. A tighter bottleneck is obviously not ideal, but it might still make sense depending on the price of the hardware.  As long as a copy of the full model and optimization state fits on the 24GB bank the PCI-E interconnect isn't really too limiting for training. Small models, like a 1B parameters voice model, will naturally fit. The larger the model you want to train, the more complex the architecture might be, but there are ways to train even models over 100B parameters on such hardware, like routing distributed fine grained experts.

Intel,"The implication here is incredibly obvious:  ""Intel Arc B-Series consistes of Battlemage discrete graphics *and* PTL iGPUs"".  That's the implication here. It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL",Neutral
Intel,Because it's most likely still the same foundation. Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.    But perhaps it's more of a RDNA 3.5 situation. Some early Druid tech backported to XE3P.    Yeah I have zero clue just guessing xD,Neutral
Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,"They aren't, though. FSR Frame Gen works on Nvidia Hardware",Neutral
Intel,Honestly we are gaining more from proprietary features than we lose from them being locked behind certain brands.

Microsoft is only now working on a directX based upscaler API that solves this problem. We should have had something like that years ago like we did for RT.",Negative
Intel,"I mean, surely it depends on when they have to share it. If they can release with the feature exclusively first, but then have to share at or after release, then it can still help the current generation of their cards until it's time for the new gen.",Neutral

Intel,The DirectX RT spec and SDK came out in 2018. The blame lies entirely on AMD. Imagine Nvidia waiting for AMD to agree,Negative
Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Negative

Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement.

Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.

That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance. Those guys literally don't care about anything other than pushing a dozen more frames in a dozen personally chosen games. Gamer Nexus and Igor too to some extent. It would be bad publicity.",Positive

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package.

Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple. And no this is not RDNA 4's Dynamic VGPR, it's a much bigger deal. Register file directly in L1$ has unique benefits.",Positive
Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral
Intel,Having so many SoC makers on arm competing against each other by one upping each other yearly is bearing fruit vs x86. i don't know how Intel and AMD long term can fare at this rate. Arm CPUs are still showing double digit gains yearly.,Neutral
Intel,Most of apples RT gains are from optmsiing how the GPU deals with divergence.  This is not dedicated RT silicon so much as making the GPU be able to maintain much higher throughput when there is lots of divergence.  RT operations have a shit tone of divergence.,Negative
Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip. I have a feeling that there will be bigger differences for the A19 Pro and A19 with that giant SLC on the former. Die areas will also be interesting. Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.  I wouldn't say its a medium core yet tbh. Apple's E cores are still sub 1mm2 in area usage. Compared to other ""M cores"" they are still relatively small. I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU. I suppose this means we should expect a lot of bragging in the M5 keynote.  I'd imagine they're saving up these to mention Blender perf etc in M5 keynote.",Neutral

Intel,"Haha. I mean they are actually pretty late to this tbh. Most ""E/M cores from other competitors"" are similar in size if not bigger.

Intel,> just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  When you take a look at GPUs doing RT task you see that they tend to be very poorly utilized.  GPUs are not designed for short running diverging workloads. But RT is exactly that. So you end up with a huge amount of divergence and or lots of wave like submissions of very small batches of work (so have a large scheduling overhead).     There is a HUGE amount of perfomance left on the table for this type of task for HW vendors that are able to reduce the impact on GPU utilization that divergence has.,Negative
Intel,Maybe Apple measures occupancy differently in their tools. I wouldn't be too sure comparing these two. But I'd definitely think a combination of SER and Dynamic Caching present in A19 should result in very good utilization compared to other uarchs.,Positive
Intel,"That is very impressive, RT tends to have very poor occupancy as it is a heavily branching workload!",Positive
Intel,>Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive.   Important to note that the supporting SLC which is a major reason for improvements om the GPU side has increased from 24Mb to 32Mb. Which would increase area a bit.,Positive

Intel,There's a guy on twitter who does the microbenchmarking for them.,Neutral
Intel,"No. I'm positive memory bandwidth offers very little in terms of performance upgrades. If you recall, the A16 was essentially the same GPU architecture as the A15 but used LPDDR5 instead of LPDDR4X, yet there were practically zero performance improvements.  I don't think anyone has investigated the A19's GPU microarchitecture thoroughly. But the main improvements seem to come from the increase in SLC size (System Level Cache which serves the GPU) from 24Mb to 32Mb and the newly improved Dynamic Caching.

Peak power P/W is not a very accurate measure to compare gen on gen. And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.   An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.",Negative

Intel,">All of these benchmarks are sort of difficult to compare when the other chips aren't made on the same node N3P.   N3P is a mere 5% faster than N3E when comparing similar microarchitectures... This is straight from TSMC's marketing slides.  Comparitively, barring the P core (which did see an ok improvement), the E core and the GPU have seen 30%+ improvements. The node has nothing to do with it.  If Qualcomm loses to, matches or exceeds A19 Pro this year it would be because of their updated microarchitectures and have barely anything to do with minor single digit improvements offer by a sub node.",Neutral

It's interesting how first gen dynamic caching + SER (apple equivalent) is hardly better than NVIDIA in terms of occupancy. Yet only 44%. So only slightly better than NVIDIA (upper end of range). Seems like first gen was more about laying the groundwork while second gen is really about pushing dynamic caching allocation granularity and efficiency. At least so it seems.  Oh for sure. That occupancy is incredibly high. \~1.5x uplift vs A18 Pro. Getting 70% occupancy in RT workload is really unheard of. Apple engineers did a fine job.  AMD might opt for this nextgen if they're serious, but it's a massive undertaking in terms of R&D, but could massively benefit PT and branch code, ideal for GPU work graphs.",Neutral

On one hand, the power inflation isn't causing problems if the 23% increased battery life per Wh is anything to go by, but on the other, what's the point of chasing peak performance like this if your boost/scheduling algorithms never allow that speed to make an impact on responsiveness?",Negative
Intel,"Geekerwan's results are ***average*** power, not peak power, IIRC. These are real, actual frequency bins that Apple has allowed.  These frequency bins *will* be hit by some workloads, but just not nearly as long as SPEC & active cooling will allow. It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2. It also shows, when nodes are not the same, where the node's improvements went. Here, an N3P core delivers notably worse perf / W versus an N3E core. TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years. Seems like not a good compromise when you're eating more power per unit of performance.

Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,">Aren’t they exactly the same p cores?  Definitely not. See the SPEC perf / GHz: A19 is nearly just the A18 Pro.

Intel,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive

Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year.

If the faster LPDDR5X-9600 in the A19 Pro eats more power, it's fair to include that power because ***all*** A19 Pros will ship with LPDDR5X-9600. That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.  It's also why I'm a big proponent of JEDEC speeds & timings & volts in desktop CPU tests, much to the chagrin of a few commenters.",Neutral

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving. It might be AMD Laptop Zen 6 has again like 35W TDP, for 3000 Geekbench and be dead, but with some client oriented tweaks I see chances (maybe just from the patterns in the tea leaves in my mug)",Negative

But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time."" on that, there would be 10 registers wasted doing nothing, if it cant find any else thats <10 registers to fit in that.",Neutral

Intel,"Because we don’t have the tools. On macOS Apple provides powermetrics but Apple states that the figures can’t necessarily be relied on.

Intel,"dynamic caching would let more copies of the shader run given that is knows the chances that every copy hits that point were it needs 30 registers is very low.   If that happens then one of those threads is then stalled but the other thing it can do is dynamicly at runtime convert cache, and thread local memroy to registers and vice versa.   So what will happen first is some data will be evicted from cache and those bits will be used as registers.   maybe that shader has a typical width of just 5 registers and only in some strange edge case goes all the way up to 30.

Intel,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear. What I meant is that the IPC of the E-core is so much higher than Tiger Lake that it's performance at 2.6GHz is surprisingly close to desktop Tiger Lake at 5GHz.  I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Intel,Same can be said for the 5050 no? Both have CPU overheads unlike AMD which any mid-range AMD GPU can easily outperform Nvidia's 5090 at 1080p.   The 12GB VRAM however are better suited for people who are stuck at older Gen3/Gen4 PCIE speeds.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll run nearly every game in existence at 1080p with playable framerates with the right settings. IDK why it would be a product for non-gamers.

It's so bad that even the prebuilts with the 16GB 9060XT will be outsold by prebuilts with a 5050 at the same price range, as companies like to pair trash GPUs with ""high"" end CPUs like a 13700F to clear stock but the ""i7"" allows them to mark up the price.",Negative

This card is 80% the performance of a 5060, which should probably be called the 5050.  To take it a step further, the GT 1030 was 13% of the 1080ti, the 5050 is 20% of the 5090.

Intel,"It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup. You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral

Also comparing the performance diff between the 1030 vs 1060 because guess what the 5060 should have been the 5050 looking at die size and memory bus.   Not sure why people keep defending these naming schemes, do you think the engineers use them internally lol? Its bullshit that marketing comes up with",Negative
Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

There are others, these are just a few popular examples.   In some games, you will merely get texture pop-in. In other games, it will become extremely stuttery (Cyberpunk).

I have also seen reviews of this graph where it raises more FPS in 1440p than in 1080p, as if the resolution made it a bottleneck.  I understand that in 1080p the load goes more towards the CPU and in 1440p the load falls on the GPU, however the difference in performance catches my attention. I have an R5 5600x and in theory it should not generate a bottleneck but this graph seems to be quite ""CPU dependent"" in 1080p resolution.",Neutral
Intel,"Your CPU will mostly hold you back if you are playing an extremely CPU-intensive game (rare) or you are already pushing very high frames. In general, GPU is most important for gaming, although this varies based on resolution. At 1080p, the CPU is a lot more important than it is at 4k, where the GPU will virtually always be the limiter (unless you're running an ancient CPU with a 5090 or some absurd scenario). Still, even at 1080p the GPU is going to be a limiter much more often than the CPU.     Arc B580 no? Because that's what you said in your title. Arc will be okay as I mentioned, but it won't be as good as a 9060xt. 9060xt is ~20-50% better on average, which is quite significant. That being said, if you absolutely cannot afford the 16GB version of the 9060xt then I would just go with the arc because running into VRAM limits will be disabling.",Neutral

Intel,They had a 6500XT on Woot for like 80$,Neutral
Intel,Ripoff for $110,Neutral
Intel,its better than what you have and for 50 you can't go wrong really...,Positive
Intel,"$50 is fine, make the trade, saves you headache. AMD has dropped game optimization support for 5000 and 6000 series Radeon cards. 1660 super came out same time as the 5000 series and NVIDIA is keeping support up for now.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it is more than double your current performance with more vram but the rx 5700xt can be commonly had for around 100$ used and is almost 50% faster than the 1660 super and with 8gb of vram instead. Although at 720p it might be overkill for your use case given the CPU you have. Not a bad deal at 50$ tbh especially since the gtx 1050 is basically worthless at this point.,Positive
Intel,"That's a bit much for a 1660s, most 10 series 50, 60 and 70 rang cards aren't expensive now. But I would look for RTX2060, where I live used ones start from 90-100euro. At 720p it will be a much better boost, plus DLSS4",Neutral
Intel,"I ran a 10400F + 1660 Super until a few months ago. It was struggling with UE5 games so much that I just got a new PC outright.  In any case, the lowest-end GPU I'd recommend in 2025 is an RX 6600 XT or an RTX 2060 Super. Anything less and you're basically settling for playing only old games.  ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: That 720p monitor (768p I assume) most likely DOES NOT have a digital input like HDMI or DisplayPort. The 1660 Super ONLY has digital outputs, maybe DVI on certain models. Make sure that the GPU and Monitor are compatible, because I sure didn't account for that back in 2019 when I got an RX 570, and had to ALSO spend money on a 1080p monitor with HDMI support instead of keeping my old 1366x768 VGA monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes as long as you are 1080p gaming and do not expect to run the absolute newest and most demanding games of the past couple years. I’ve been using a gtx 1660ti since 2021 and I love it. It also overclocks to the moon perfectly stable. I’ve got +150 on the core, +1300 on the memory at 110% power limit. It will happily go higher, but I stopped there as I wanted the temp under load to stay under 75c.  Edit: that overclock worked out to about 10% more fps in games for me  Also, not sure if your 1050ti requires a power connector but the 1660s does so make sure you have one. Your power supply should be fine though, as that card usually draws 100w at most.",Positive
Intel,My 1660 super still feels good enough with today's games. Other than Indiana Jones. All other games run well enough for me. Busy with ARC Raiders and BF6 at the moment.,Positive
Intel,"16 series is fantastic for last gen, mostly useless for current gen.  But its much much more balanced in line with your CPU than a 1050ti is and that trade seems like a fine deal as long as everything works",Positive
Intel,"Honestly I was using a 1660 and a 1080 for way longer than I should have but it runs like all games on really really decent settings as long as you aren't playing modern AAA games. If you've got the extra money, a newer card is better of course though",Positive
Intel,"It depends on what you're expecting. It'll run most games. RT only games won't run. It's a decent card and my older brother still uses it in his build for some racing games and shooters. But if you're looking to play all the latest games like indiana jones and doom the dark ages, I'd save a bit more money and get something newer with more vram.",Neutral
Intel,"It's not.  At the very least I would get the 2060. It's only 20% more performance in raster, but, crucially, it can run DLSS - which is gonna be another 20-30% more performance, even at that resolution.",Neutral
Intel,If you're curious about how much more performance you'll be getting compared to your old 1050ti check out this video. It's a straight really good upgrade for you at $50. You'd probably be able to play at 1080p at a mostly stable 60fps depending on the game and settings. Especially older games no problem.  https://youtu.be/N8i-neXsMH8  It's perfectly viable. Contrary to what a lot of people say you don't have to always have the newest and best tech if your expectations aren't sky high. And it's still a far better deal for you at the moment than buying an entire new PC.  And here's a 1660 super running Arc Raiders. It runs amazing for how well the game looks.  https://youtu.be/h_31FmStPuY,Positive
Intel,Decent card for 1080p gaming in older last gen games. It's too slow for modern releases.,Negative
Intel,It will be a good boost in performance for 50$.,Positive
Intel,"if the deal is legit and you are sure that there wont be any funny business, i'd say that its a no brainer   you will see a noticeable increase in your PC's output. if [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1660S-Super-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti/4056vs3649](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1660S-Super-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti/4056vs3649) is correct, you would be facing 94% increase in your graphical output   congratulations beforehand",Positive

Intel,I stopped using my GTX 760 which is pretty much the same performance as 1050 TI in  2020 I was getting 30 fps most games  idk how you made it 5 more years lol,Negative
Intel,How is that viable I just bought a almost brand new 3050 for 140,Neutral
Intel,"Bro I wouldn't pay that and, however trading your old GPU and $50 isn't bad because realistically your gonna get -20-30 tops. And you can find 1660 supers on marketplace all day for 100 or less",Neutral
Intel,"Don't expect much a performance difference.... yeah its better, but it still wont handle even slightly modern titles very well. You'd be much better off saving up a little bit more money and find9ng something newer.",Negative
Intel,"Sheer willpower, I've not played too many games I wanted, earliest being RDR2. I actually wanted to get a new GPU just when miners peaked, then 'Rona happened, then I hit financial low. Used market was also horrid. Only with 40 series and now 50 series am I able to buy a GPU. Last year I almost rage bought a 4060 lol Now I'm aiming for a 5070",Negative
Intel,"Viable because the RTX 3050 is an absolute shit deal of a card. It’s slightly lower than a 1660 Super on average. Its only upsides are DLSS, Frame Gen, and longer driver support.  For $50, the 1660 Super is a steal, and OP is able to get rid of their old GPU in the process too. It’s two birds with one stone.",Negative
Intel,6GB or 8GB?  The 1660 Super is better than a 3050 6GB anyways.,Positive
Intel,"I went from a 1050ti to a 1660 super a few years ago. And it gave me plenty of extra performance. My wife still uses that card to game at 1080p, and she has had no complaints so far. You just have to be ready to lower your settings.  Biggest downside is the lack of dlss.",Positive
Intel,What does she play?,Neutral
Intel,"When she first build the pc she played a lot of Hogwarts legacy. Which ran great. She also plays satisfactory.  I also used it to play games like Cyberpunk, HZD and Metro Exodus on (I think) at least medium. And I used a 1440p monitor.  I know a 1660 super is far from the newest or best cars. But it still performs ok in most modern titles as long as you dont expect to much and lower the settings. And I think for 50, it can be a decent deal.",Positive
Intel,"Try it. Some of the older games are probably fine, newer probably not.  In any case a dedicated gaming desktop PC would definitely be a much better experience. But you don’t have to go crazy. Around $1200 is the sweet spot IMO. Check the sidebar for resources and guides.",Positive
Intel,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ptRLMB4m2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ptRLMB4m2I) he tested your exact CPU & iGPU and overall it looks playable depends on what your standard of playable means (with 1080p, around 40fps, no 60fps unfortunately). Most of the games you mentioned has upscaling tech like FSR/XESS that you can use in the graphic settings of each game to further improve the performance (basically playing the game in less than 1080p then upscale it to 1080p).     But if what you want is a 1080p stable 60fps for now and for the future, you definitely need something more than what you have right now. 1080p 60fps is easy to achieve with less than 700USD budget. Even more lower if you are confident in buying used parts",Neutral
Intel,"If you’re hesitant about buying games in case they don’t run well, you could always do a month of Xbox Game Pass and use any games on there to benchmark.",Neutral
Intel,"I say build the PC, as a Gen Xer who hadn't touched PC gaming in 20 years I just built a gaming PC.  Had a blast doing it.  Just grab an awesome case and a mid tier GPU for starters.  I bought a Radeon 6800 XT GPU off of a friend and started from there.  My setup isn't top tier but it games incredibly.  Indiana Jones and Ghosts of Tsushima look fantastic.",Positive
Intel,We don't know your exact situation; actually test the games.,Neutral
Intel,"You might be able to play a couple of titles with the the specs you listed (call of duty world at war for example, maybe some older resident evil games) but it would be cutting it close and it would be low/medium settings",Neutral

Intel,"Treat yourself to the PC, you’ve earned it!",Positive
Intel,"Intel arc on the laptop runs older games pretty decently. Check the youtube link below for list of games.

Often times you will see pre-built pcs, or shops scamming their customers by selling them ancient hardware for the same price as a new pc.",Positive
Intel,"since you said you have enough money to get a PC, do that, treat yourself with a decent setup, it would be a million times better than playing on a laptop, especially the games you mentioned, if you can share your budget im sure we can figure out a good PC for those games, you won't need anything crazy i promise haha, all mid range pc combinations are able to run all those very well",Positive
Intel,"When it comes to pc game, there are so many variables.  Graphics setting, resolution, upscaling, genre of game and perceived smoothness of different FPS all contribute to how well a game run for you.  It is really hard to tell without trying.    For an integrated gpu, yours is by no means weak, but it still cannot compare to modern discrete gpu.  Generally, anything in or before ps4 era(i.e released before 2020 ) should run fine with minimum graphics setting at 1080p with fsr / xess upscaling. It should safely run at 30fps or above (i.e. as smooth or smoother than ps4 game)  Anything newer you will have to either watch benchmark on youtube, try the demo or benchmark tool of the game(some games offer this).  Steam also support refund of games played in less than 2 hours and purchased less than 2 weeks.  But don’t do that too much or you will be denied the refund.",Neutral
Intel,Those are pretty good specs for a laptop i would think it would be fine but i only play on desktop. Laptop components arent as good because its harder to keep them cool,Positive
Intel,"I think personally you should build a pc! As long as your budget allows it you can get something for around 600 bucks on facebook marketplace, or you can build with used parts off of facebook marketplace.   If you want recommendations I’ll give you some:  Ryzen 5 5900x (180ish used)  RX6700xt (200ish bucks used)  Asus b450-f motherboard (50 - 100 bucks used)  32gb ddr4 ram whatever you’d like, probably Corsair though. (80-100ish)  PSU 650W (something reputable like Corsair) (90 bucks)  You can find good air coolers for the cpu for under 50 bucks just do research.   You’re looking at 680 bucks on the high end but definitely can find parts to fit a cheaper budget. Feel free to message me and I’d be glad to help you find something.  Edit: this is what you should expect as far as performance, you should expect with these exact specs to be able to play currently all games on high settings, competitive or first person shooters tend to run better than single player games in my experience, I’d expect 120+ frames on 1080p, or even higher than that if you drop your settings. As far as single player games, you should be able to max out most games and get a solid 60fps which is fine for single player.",Positive

Intel,Subscribe to PC Gamepass for a month ($17) and you'll have a bunch of different games to try and see how it fares. My guess is the integrated graphics won't be up to snuff for anything but indie games.,Neutral

Intel,"The nice thing about building a desktop, is that you can upgrade it over time.  Cpu, motherboard and ram need to be bought together, but a decent power supply can last for years as can your case and monitor. I'm an old guy who has been building PCs for myself and kids for around 20 years.   Get a mid tower case with good air flow and a quality PSU.  I'd look at website recommendations for the best bang for your buck AMD BUILD for your cpu and motherboard recommendations , get 2 sticks of 16 gig ram., a 1 tb M2 ssd as a system drive, and dump the rest into the GPU.   27 inch monitors are fairly cheap now, and you can get whatever keyboard and mouse you want.",Positive

You can upgrade to the upper end of AM5, but at least in the US market, their prices are inflated to hell. For the price of something mid-line like a 5600X, you're 1/3 of the way to an AM5 upgrade.

Intel,"Because of high popularity of 5700X3D and 5800X3D -- and that they are now both out of production, it's likely their used prices have increased.  As a result, since you aren't on AM4 already, unless you're getting a killer deal on a used 5700X3D/5800X3D, recommend you go with 9600X + B850 + usual 32 GB 6000 CL30 kit. Should be right around 400 pounds.",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700x3d and 5800x3d are no longer the value deals that they were. They're essentially end of life so have gone up (unless you can find a deal!).    If you want cheap performance and also to keep your DDR4 RAM, i think the best deals currently are i5-14600/K/KF and a B760 DDR4 motherboard. That's going to be the best bang for your buck.    However, i don't see the AM5 parts that much more expensive. Obviously, if you're looking at 9950x3D etc then you're paying a lot. But you could get a Ryzen 5 7600/7600X/9600X that'll perform better than your 7700K for pretty cheap and a B650 board for a good price. The only spanner in the works is the price of RAM.

There were some edge cases were i would have recommended going am4 used (like 16 cores or a lot of cheap ram), but with ram prices skyrocketing, thats not really an option anymore. I would go am4 if you do a really budget gaming build like with a r5 3600, or you get a REALLY good deal on a am4 prebuilt. Am5 will have a much longer lifespan, with cpu upgrades coming and reusing ddr5....",Neutral

Intel,"If it's just performance as the i7 you can get AM4 non-x3d or LGA 1700 and still maybe get a gpu upgrade with whats left. If you were considering x3d chances are you'll spend roughly the same for entry-level am5.   You don't really need anything fancy like a 9600x and B850, get a 7500f + b650 and it'll still be a huge upgrade. Even 16gb ram would be alright.",Neutral
Intel,9600x+B850 board.   B650 boards are on end of life. Production stoped and updates soon also.  Go B850 for future path to upgrades following Zen6 and maybe Zen7,Neutral
Intel,Unless you have an AM4 board and the DDR4 RAM already you should go AM5.  AM4 is just not worth it anymore with the scarcity of x3d CPUs and DDR4 RAM prices climbing.  The budget nature of AM4 is pretty much done.,Negative
Intel,"Jump to am5. You’re not already on am4, you have to buy a new motherboard for that, though you can re use memory. But the 7600/9600 areas fast as the 5800x3D and a lot cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"Entirely depends on what your new vs used pricings are locally. I would not even consider any AM4 X3D rigs here, they cost more than a new set of B650+7500F+32GB RAM.",Negative
Intel,5800x3D is pointless for new builders as it's insanely priced just go AM5 and grab a 7600x/9600x,Negative
Intel,You're not going to find a 5800x3d at a decent price unless you have some friend who's still holding onto AM4 for some reason.,Negative
Intel,"Do you have DDR4 RAM already? Then AM4 should be fine. The cost of RAM is soaring right now, so either buy RAM immediately or just stick to 5800x3d. It'll be great for years to come, and then just upgrade to AM6.   I would have recommended AM6, just as most will, but that was before the leaping RAM prices.",Positive
Intel,"5800X3D & 5700X3D are out of production and thus, the prices are only getting higher. Including used prices.   Just a quick search on ebay and sold listings are showing an average of $300-350, with some at $400 or more as a bundle with motherboard and RAM.   For not much more money, at around $550, you can get a 9600X, a B850 motherboard and 32GB of DDR5.   If RAM prices weren't skyrocketing like they currently are, you could have gotten a basic AM5 setup for around $450 a few weeks ago. Some of the price hike can be explained by RAM chips being purchased for AI, due to many many data centers popping up all over major cities. But also can be explained by the upcoming holiday season in a few short weeks. Its a common trend now - you can use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel or PCPartpicker to look at the pricing trend.   Its not really ideal to move to AM4, especially buying brand new parts - the cost difference is in AM5's favor even with the DDR5 price hike. Any better CPU upgrade down the line would require you to jump to a new platform anyway, which means CPU/MOBO/RAM at a minimum.   Hell, if you're willing to wait a few weeks to see what the holiday ""sales"" bring. (more people are becoming aware that a few weeks before the holiday season price hikes tend to happen so that things like Black Friday and Christmas sales make you believe you're getting a good deal)  Starting off with something like the 9600X build I listed below will give you far more longevity, and the socket itself will have 1 or 2 more CPU generations so you'll still have an upgrade path even if something like AM6 comes out.

Intel,"youre a bit late , RAM prices are through the roof right now. My suggestion would be stay at am4 for now and wait till AM5 components come down in prices, i dont know when, but they will eventually",Negative
Intel,"That’s amazing, I’ll shop around for some parts and look at the lists others have supplied in this thread, I’d be thrilled if I can get it as low as £400. Thanks so much for this advice.",Positive
Intel,"I’m not especially determined to keep my DDR4 RAM other than the cost of buying DDR5. I’ll have a look at DDR4 options but I’m out of the loop on the 13/14th gen Intel issues. In my ignorance, I’m overly cautious and would probably prefer AMD, and most comments are suggesting the 9600X in that avenue.  Thanks for another perspective, I’ll learn more about the Intel issue and look into DDR4 options too.",Negative
Intel,Thanks so much. That PCPP list is cheaper than I was hoping so I’m very happy with that. Thank you,Positive
Intel,The future upgrade path was also on my mind. I’ve already got the best the LGA1151 socket offers and it’s been frustrating that I can’t upgrade without replacing basically everything! Starting at the low end of AM5 means I can upgrade to better CPUs a few years from now without replacing the motherboard. Thank you for the comment.,Positive
Intel,"Haha, it’s good to hear directly from people who have recently made similar jumps. You hear barely anyone still talking about hardware this old and the best ways to upgrade.   The combination you mentioned seems almost ubiquitous in this thread, and I’ll probably go for the very same. I hadn’t really thought to look at prebuilt or combo deals but I’ll browse around here. It would be nice to move to watercooling too, just maybe not right now. Thanks for the comment!",Positive
Intel,"Don’t I know it. But with consideration of all the other comments here, and the fact I’ll be spending probably £400 even without RAM, I might as well make it last a bit longer by going for a newer socket. Thanks for the comment still :)",Neutral
Intel,"The Intel issue really only applies to i7 and i9. However, i wouldn't even suggest a 13th gen part because the memory controller on them was borked. They fixed that for 14th gen.",Negative
Intel,All the AM5 processors will likely suit your gaming needs while still giving you a bit of an upgrade path if necessary.,Positive
Intel,"Any benchmarks you see for 13/14 Gen make sure to take note of the RAM it uses.  Most are benchmarked using DDR5 and DDR4 will have lesser performance, especially if the DDR4 you have is  DDR4-2133 or something rather than later production DDR4-3200 or higher.",Neutral
Intel,"In general Am4 is not bad per se, a lot of people on am4 (me included) gonna sit out the launch of am6. Those who started at its launch 2017 got a hell of an upgrade out of that socket. Problem is just its really bad value at its price compared to am5....   Oh. And dont forget to sell your old stuff, you will still get money for it....",Negative
Intel,"No worries brother. I hadn't built a pc in 15 years so figuring all this stuff out again was a fun but painful update. It is surprising how badly connected info is on all this stuff, especially how even a budget gaming rig for around $1k today absolutely smashes hardware that was near the top of the line pre-pandemic.   I went with a peerless assassin 120se air cooler... I helped a buddy replace his water cooler in his pre-built when the little pump died on it... made me a little sour on water cooling too. With a little 65w 9600x processor its only about asthetics as you could cool that with a $20 air cooler if you wanted.   Goodluck and happy hunting!",Negative
Intel,"It applies to all Raptor Lake CPUs with a TDP of 65W or higher, which includes the i5s.  However, it was significantly more common on the i7s and i9s as you mentioned.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks, not sure I’ll get much for a CPU/motherboard that is definitely faulty somewhere but maybe someone else will be able to diagnose it better and get something out of it.",Negative
Intel,"If we want to be pedantic about it, it applies only to the *600 class i5s as the 400 and 500 are not Raptor lake.    I do not think i ever saw any evidence of failing 14600 class CPUs and with the BIOS updates, these will pretty much be guaranteed to be fine. Voltages are good on these parts.",Neutral
Intel,"9060xt 16gb or 5060ti 16gb  https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html",Neutral
Intel,Basically without a cpu upgrade you'd be holding back most modern gpus you'd put in your system.   I guess you could get a GPU as a future proof. Just remember you won't be getting all of the preformance.,Neutral
Intel,"I was afraid of this, but understood. I'm open to pushing the budget around if needed. The 1440p was not something I originally planned, but after making the swap last year I love it. Again with an eye to future proofing, I get that I need to rethink the budget. If we were talking closer to $500, does that extra $100 do enough to be in a more reasonable ballpark?",Positive
Intel,"You're laying it on a bit thick, it's not even an actual bottleneck on the card. A 9060XT isn't close to overkill",Negative
Intel,I doubt it. They’re aiming for 60fps and are fine with less. And want to spend less than $300. It’s not like they’re trying to put in a 5090.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes $500 is much easier, but that card will work fine for 1440p, it's just that some people don't like buying used.   9060 XT or 7800 XT are both fine for 1440p. 7800 has more raw power but 9060 has better software support. Maybe 16gb 5060ti but they can be hard to find sometimes.",Positive
Intel,No no no. It's more his cpu won't be able to get the most out of a card like that. The card is overkill for his cpu.,Negative
Intel,I disagree. His cpu is very outdated and will bottle neck any modern GPU that isn't super budget tier.,Negative
Intel,"Got it. Yes I have no issue buying used/was frankly expecting I would. This is all good to know, thank you!",Positive
Intel,"https://youtu.be/TXKyQYiLro8?si=x9qS64Z2w4HIJG3Z  There’s outliers, but not many?  And here’s for the 5060/9060: https://youtu.be/NqRTVzk2PXs?si=0Qp-3x-2sdNJeJKo",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate the back and forth on this. Frankly I just don't think I can upgrade GPU and CPU at the moment, especially if I need to up the GPU budget by $200. I think $500 is probably swing-able (just not what I was planning). But I imagine even with that push I can't reasonably do both. At the risk of sounding silly...the idea of getting a GPU now that will be limited by CPU, and then upgrading the CPU in a couple years, seems feasible and reasonable to me. I don't mind not being able to push things in terms of gaming, or having to wait a couple years to fully use the GPU's potential.   Again I've been fine with my 1060 for all these years...so it's not like I'm trying to max things out.",Neutral
Intel,"I have an R5 5600 and 5070.... Yes, there is some bottleneck... At 1080p(the card is usually 95%).  At 1440p? Minimal bottleneck, the card goes 100%, but, very rarely there is a stutter, which is alleviated with a bit of tweak on the settings.   To say it would be a bottleneck for a 9060xt or 5060ti is a stretch.",Neutral
Intel,yeah. I bought a 9060xt 16gb to go with my r5 3600 after watching their video.  I don't regret it at all.,Positive
Intel,This is fair. It's all up to the buyer. I just like giving people as much info as possible before their purchase. All that matters in the end is if the setbacks are worth it for you or not.,Neutral
Intel,"The ~~5060/~~ 9060xt’s are $350. Or, are you using CAD $?",Neutral
Intel,"I have an R5 5600+ rtx5070.  There is a little bottleneck, but you will not really notice it. Especially, if you play a little with settings on 1440p or dsr.  You shouldn't worry too much... That said, 9070 or 5070 /  9060xt or 5060ti, up to you.  Please  note that, the 9070 is faster than the 5070 and you might need to dial it back a little to minimize the CPU bottleneck.  Hope that helps.",Neutral
Intel,Don't shoot the messenger. Don't believe me? Look it up yourself. These aren't my stats lol.,Negative
Intel,"Of course, and appreciate the info/clarity! Again my biggest hurdle here is just being so out of the game that I have no idea what I'm looking at. The comments here are extremely helpful, even if they are just helping me realize my original plans may not make sense, or I need to be realistic about what I may still be compromising!",Positive
Intel,"USD. But, and I realize I didn't make this clear in the OP, I also don't mind buying used if needed.",Neutral
Intel,Look I don't want you to get the wrong idea. I'm not trying to crap on the Ryzen 5600. I've simply pointed out a fact. One that op should be aware of.,Neutral
Intel,Exactly. Most people don't upgrade all at once anyways unless it's a new build. It's a very normal thing.,Neutral
Intel,The Powercolor Reaper 9060xt 16gb for $350 at Newegg seems like the right move if you can swing it. Otherwise you’re back to the overwhelming mess of cross referencing past generation GPU performance and used prices.,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks. Yes I think I can, I realize my budget may have been a little unrealistic - $350 should be entirely doable. Thanks for the suggestion/tip here! That said - if we were looking in the $400-$450 range, anything you'd recommend instead?",Positive
Intel,"There’s too many variations of used options out there for me to definitively say. Looking at some charts and some prices, maybe a 4070 super? Less VRAM but still performs quite a bit better than the 9060xt and has DLSS. Older generations of AMD cards won’t have FSR4 access (right now?) which looks better than FSR3.

No one “needs” half the pc parts they get but if you keep your pcs for 6+ years then yes a 7800x3d would be a much better choice.   It’s already dropped in price and likely to go on sale during Black Friday. Also gives the guy a chance to upgrade his monitor over the next year or 2 if he so chooses.  You see I don’t mind going to work saving my money and spending just over $1000 for a pc I’ll get years of use out of.

In your last post, we advised you that your ram was too fast because you had a CL28 ram kit. you might have over-adjusted and picked slow ram, my friend. 5600mt is good speed, but cl46 is slow reaction time.

Intel,Oh sorry lol I was working on another build private  [https://pcpartpicker.com/user/xxSineaterxx/saved/#view=HJy4Bm](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/xxSineaterxx/saved/#view=HJy4Bm),Neutral
Intel,"thanks, yeah yall connvinced me. i'm returning it",Positive
Intel,i4-14700 and Arc B580.. not saying any of those choices are wrong... but the i7 is a high end CPU paired with a budget GPU. i5-14600K and 9060XT could've been better but ok... and also the Arc B580 can't really play on 4K without HEAVY XeSS.,Negative
Intel,"It is a pretty questionable HTPC build tbh. You definitely should’ve allocated more money to the GPU.   14700 is a pricey chip, I’m sure the 14600k is cheaper and you easily could’ve power limited it in bios. Alternatively a 14400 would’ve been fine too.  As well I went ddr4 with my build and it was quite a bit cheaper.   Sf750 for this build is super overkill. It’s a great PSU, I have 2 of them, but they are very pricey.   Just the cost of fans you probably could’ve gotten a 9060xt as well.",Negative
Intel,"This is not a gaming PC, it’s a media centre PC. For gaming, I use an RTX 4070 Super. The 65 watt i7 was chosen because it’s a cool running CPU, averaging 30–32 degrees in this build. Also, to semi future proof it for if I ever do turn it into a gaming PC. The Arc B580 was chosen for it’s great through-hole design that helps with airflow, which is beneficial given this SFF PC’s restrictive layout. That said, I have another build with a ARC B580 that games at 1440p just fine, so this PC would still be perfectly capable for gaming.",Positive
Intel,"It’s pointless to invest more money into the GPU at this stage, given that this is a media centre PC and not a gaming rig. The 65 watt i7-14700 was chosen not only because it’s a cool-running CPU, averaging 30–32 degrees, but also to semi future-proof the system in case I decide to convert it into a gaming PC later on. If that happens, I’d be using a higher-end GPU and wouldn’t want to be limited by an i5. The Arc B580 was selected because it’s more than capable for my current needs and features a through-hole design that helps with airflow. As for the PSU, while a 750-watt PSU isn’t strictly necessary, it’s 2025 and with GPUs continuing to demand more power, I wouldn’t go any lower. With the way this build is set up, I’d only need to upgrade the GPU in a few years, and that’s only if I choose to turn it into a gaming PC. The fans, been using Noctua fans for many years and I wouldn’t touch anything else.",Neutral
Intel,Lol sorry mb. But you should mention that somewhere,Negative
Intel,What does media center pc mean in your context? For me my HTPC is being used like a gaming pc for my TV.   Also Intel is very good with idle power draw but make sure you’ve limited the boost wattage. For me I’ve limited my 14500 to 95w on short bursts. The 14700 should have a higher base boost power.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean just watching movies, listening to music, streaming and video encoding. No gaming.  I also have a 14500, a 14700K, and another 14700 in three other PCs. Those are gaming systems, and I’ve found that when set to Intel default settings, they average around 60–65 degrees during gaming without me needing to enforce power limits, since Intel default settings enforce them automatically.  Edit: 60–65 degrees for the non-K CPUs. My 14700K runs more like 70–75 degrees. Honestly, I much prefer the non-K 14700, since in my benchmarks it performed only 3–5% lower, yet ran cooler and used less power. Not like anyone overclocks these days anyway.",Neutral

RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.   It just means that if AMD develop anything new, like FSR4, it won't be made backward compatible with older cards.

Intel,"The Advanced Marketing department thing comes from that deranged weirdo at UBM, if memory serves, and the irony is that he makes that joke to imply that they are only good at marketing, but bad at creating products, which is the literal inverse of reality.

Intel,This makes perfect sense with redstone supposedly coming this year of course they were going to split the driver stack. Terrible communication aside this seems pretty obvious,Negative
Intel,I hope thats what AMD will actually do and not just PR corporate bullshit meant to save face. Still kinda sucks that 6000 series will never get official FSR 4 support unlike the 2000 series getting DLSS 4 which is a massive improvement.,Negative
Intel,So kind of like microsofts feature support vs extended support  You don't get the new shiny but we fix what you already have  I suppose you'd only see over time if that's a big deal or not.

Intel,"It's still pretty dumb: if eg. FSR4 or any new feature set can improve the performance of an older card, without an inherently crapton of additional massaging, it should be made to do so. And reportedly, FSR4 has already been shown to work on and improve performance of these older generation RDNA cards in modded drivers, so it has been demonstrated that the only obstacle in implementing it is a profit-seeking one. Though saying that is there not profit in providing value for customers on older hardware, doesn't that build the brand, etc. or are they just interested in pushing the next generation of eWaste into the bin sooner.",Neutral

Intel,">is that any NEW software tech that's developed from now on, will only be available for 7000 series and up GPU's  Well that's disappointing. It's way too soon. I'm sure it's not just due to hardware limitations, since 6000 and 7000 share similar hardware necessary for upscaling. They can't throw that ""we drop support because compatibility blah blah"" card on consumers.  Well on a positive note, it's good that 6000 series will still get FSR4 support thru mods, although that might be limited, as some online games could trigger anticheats.",Negative
Intel,That just sounds like BS from AMD.   Why come out and say something you already said. What this sounds like is AMD trying to back peddle a decision that would cost them future sales. The best part is if they get this out there now. Then oops don't update for games moving forward. Then no one will say a word. It will be done and over with.   Everyone knew FSR4 and the like wasn't coming to RDNA1/2 gpu's they said this before. They don't back port new stuff anyway.   So just more corpo speak for hey we screwed up now forget bout it look a shiny thing consumer look at the shiny.,Negative
Intel,Which I feel like they didn’t need to say? Like obviously not every feature is going to be supported an older hardware already right now FSR 4 is not available on the 7000 series though the rumour is they will have it eventually. Like why is this something the end user needs to be informed about?   I almost wonder if they were planning on pulling Support and then just decided to say that it was misinterpreted because they saw the reaction,Negative

Intel,"I'm pretty sure the clarification had a big asterisk of something along the lines ""we will continue updating them according to market demand"", i think they're still moving them to maintenance mode the same they did for Polaris and Vega which means they will continue necessary bug and security fixes, unlikely to recieve optimizations (tho still possible) but more importantly no new features will be added, this kinda sucks when you consider RTX 20 series which is older than RDNA2 is still receiving partial support for new DLSS features.",Negative
Intel,the original message was slightly ambiguous but then literally every news outlet choose to interpret it in the very worst way possible and then add clickbait headlines on top of that misinterpretation.

Intel,I mean it would have been great if they officially supported 6000. Technically there's no reason to exclude 6000 from the FSR4 backporting aside from them wanting to force consumers to buy their recent GPUs.

Intel,"OK, 1080ti you aren't wrong. I still have one alive and well in a rig with an accellero 3 cooler conversion.  But...  1080ti only happened because NVIDIA got spooked that AMD were about to drop some absolute fire. They believed it enough that they actually let some performance out of the bag and into the market... otherwise they would have released a crappier card on purpose, because that is legitimately what NVIDIA do without any real competition: hold back technology and dribble it out in ever crappier improvements year on year.  AI is cool, but apart from GPT doing my spreadsheets for me (which costs OpenAI far more than my subscription) , it's made every single product it's integrated in worse.  It's already at the point where a customer faced with the choice between AI assistant integrated VS vocally proclaiming no AI...they will pick the one without AI because it's just data harvesting guff.  It is a bubble. There will be no AGI. Customers are already tired of the lies, and companies aren't going to keep losing money to do my spreadsheets for me.",Neutral
Intel,Not gonna lie. AI is extremely useful. But the energy consumption is what is going to be the limiting factor. They need to focus on power efficiency if they want to prevent that burst but I bet they won’t.,Neutral

My original comment was about both AMD *and* Nvidia not giving old cards new features, and your rebuttal was ""my 3060 gets driver updates"".  Driver updates, patches, and bug fixes are not new features, though. Adding official DLSS3 support to 30x0 GPUs would be a new feature.",Negative

Intel,"Nvidia is in a position that sure, when the bubble bursts they'll lose evaluation as AI demand decreases but they won't burst themselves. The bubble bursting will destroy any company that just slapped AI on their app description and hoped to get bought by VC/investors before they had to show how they made money. No different than the Dot Com bubble or Mobile App bubble or social media bubble. Some companies like OpenAI or Google or Anthropic will ""win"", they'll buy up any startup/smaller company that actually shows promise (or potentially has promise and would deny competitors the engineers working there) then the market will calcify. Nvidia, however, supplies whoever wins regardless so while there won't be bidding wars, demand isn't likely to decrease for a long while.",Neutral

Intel,Yeah not happening,Negative
Intel,"Data Centers use a lot of power, and there's more demand for data centers than before, but this isn't a specific to AI problem. I've ran local LMs (Llama primarily) on my own server, they're not significantly harder or demanding to run than a typical server. Per the UPS I have attached to it, that single server uses around 200-400W the average is around 1700kW/h per year, and this is a fairly inefficient homelab.   Image/Video generation on the other hand, requires a lot more processing power, as anyone who's worked VFX will tell you, but this isn't the bulk of work that LLMs are doing. It's also why AI was able to ""pop up"" on every site so quickly, as it's really not significantly more intensive for Cloud providers than most K8S systems. This isn't a _pro_ AI comment btw, just noting that the power consumption aspect is a bit of misinformation that companies like OpenAI are _themselves_ pushing as if they make it seem too intensive to ""get in"" at this point, they solidify themselves as the defacto winner of the AI bubble. It's also why they recently have started bringing up ""ethical concerns"" about data theft and wanting regulation on data scraping...because they've already scraped everything. They want regulations now because it helps solidify their position.",Neutral

Intel,"Look at the amount of money going into AI, and then the amount of revenue being generated by AI. The difference is insane, and I see no realistic path to profitability.   It's all driven by speculation and a downright messianic belief that if they just crack ""AGI"" first they're going to be the rulers of a new world where everyone needs AI for everything.

Intel,"That's updating an existing feature, though, as the 3060 already supports DLSS4.  An actual *new* feature would be something like Nvidia enabling DLSS frame generation on the 30 series; something it doesn't currently officially support.  It seems like it's kinda splitting hairs, but that's what the whole AMD thing is/was about: People thinking that ""no new features"" means the same thing as ""no updates"".  Like, the RX 6600 supports FSR3, so if FSR3 gets an update, that update will apply to the RX6600. Just like the DLSS update applied to your 3060.",Neutral

Intel,"It's was a tech bubble in the US in the late 90s. Basically startups were popping up and getting investors just to start online businesses or websites, so you'd have huge purchases or investments in new companies that were basically just ""noun"" + "".com"" (the ending to our website addresses in the US at the time).  You had ridiculous stuff pop up nearly everyday and get investment, and then in 2-3 years the investors (and the companies) realized they had no way to actually make money, so the bubble burst.  You can look up articles and videos on it by searching for ""Dot Com Bubble"", it's often discussed.  Ironically, many of the failed businesses' ideas are a profitable thing now, and similar websites and companies exist - but the fact was the infrastructure and demand just wasn't there 25 years ago.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, but we're talking about Nvidia. So they'll still be in the AI game for as long as AI exists. So the bubble bursting will never bankrupt Nvidia, only companies buying from Nvidia. The point is that Nvidia is never leaving the AI game now, because they are THE source of the hardware for AI.",Neutral
Intel,"The overreaction are indeed crazy. But that being said, Nvidias stock is so absurdly high due to their profit margins and sales volume.

Intel,![gif](giphy|YVPwi7L2izTJS)  You do video editing and 3d modeling and you don't remember how much RAM your PC has?  You came into a LARGE sum of money and you want to debate over a $100 difference in not-the-top-tier GPUs?,Negative

Intel,That doesn't make much sense.  For 3D modeling it makes no difference as the only raster you'd see is in the viewport.  Unless you meant doing the actual render?,Negative
Intel,What would your case for it be? I'm assuming driver updates will close the gap between the 5070ti and the 9070xt in arc raiders. (Which is the game i am playing like hardcore since it came out lol),Neutral
Intel,"Look man, in blender I said it’s a huge difference. But in other stuff like video rendering in davincii which I use, it’s a wash. For photoshop it’s almost identical because it’s mostly cpu and encoding is roughly the same. So as long as software isn’t cuda accelerated it’s almost the same performance.",Neutral
Intel,Price to performance. The 9070xt is a very well performing card and with a good undervolt it performs just as well as a 5080. However with 3d modeling and editing you’ll have better performance on a 5070ti. Just have to choose what is more important lol,Positive
Intel,"slight is an understatement. As someone who renders stuff most of my days and even does 3d, a difference of 10s or even 50s might seem that insignificant in hindsight, but if you multiply it by like 30x (continous multiple project rendering) it accumulates to something even bigger.",Neutral

It’s all going to depend on what game you’re playing, what GPU and CPU you have, how RNGesus is feeling that day, and countless other factors. I’m sure Nvidia’s optimizing feature helps somewhat, but your best bet is to research what settings other people use for each specific game, and experiment from there.",Neutral
Intel,"PC fans generally work better in push configuration, you want them to push air into the heatsink, not pull air from the heatsink. You have both fans in pull configuration which is not ideal, on top of that you have a cpu fan followed by a back exhaust fan, that is a bit of a waste, you dont need to have back to back fans. So take the left cpu fan and attach it on the very right of the cpu heatsink right above the ram slots as push fan, and the attack the middle cpu fan onto the other tower so it primarily pushes air into the second tower, and pulling air from the first (right) tower is secondary. That should give you 2-3°C better temperatures and better noise profile because if there is no space between fan blades and heatsink, it usually creates unwated turbolences and extra noise",Neutral

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Intel,"VRAM usage is specific.  In context of Unity games and VRChat - Nvidia does use less VRAM than AMD... but only in Windows, only Nvidia DX driver in Windows have this ""hidden feature"" and only with DX API. So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

AMD is lacking in pro support for quite specific but very important things and you aren't the first professional to point this stuff out.

Intel,Darktide looks&runs way better with FSR2 than native 1080p for me. I don't know how they do it but there is no amount of AA that makes native resolution look better.,Positive
Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,This gives me hope that Star Wars outlaws will also have FSR 3. 🤌,Positive
Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Negative
Intel,"If you look in the top right, these seem to be based on ray tracing being enabled? If that is the case, these specs actually seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"FSR and DLSS were supposed to be optional, now they seem to be mandatory in any graphics setup.",Neutral
Intel,Yay finally a game that'll have both fsr 3 and dlss 3 so it'll work perfectly on either gpu brand at launch.,Positive
Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative
Intel,This game better look like real life with those specs. I does looks beautiful!,Positive
Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,and a year ago i kept saying this here and i got downvoted to hell   its so obvious that the game engine devs and game companies pressured both nvidia and amd for this because they can release games faster and somewhat unoptimised,Negative
Intel,"Upscaling, once a promising and beneficial tech, now abused by almost every dev cause they are lazy to optimize. :(",Negative
Intel,Nope we as a community abused a nice thing,Negative
Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative
Intel,i smell a burgeoning cottage industry of game spec reviewers!,Positive
Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral
Intel,"Judging by how games work on 4090/7900 xtx, these cards turn from 4k 60 fps to 1080p 60 fps",Neutral
Intel,requirements have been a joke for over 20 years at this point i dont know why people are surprised.   on the other hand crappy devs using fancy upscaling and fake frames to get the game playable instead of just making a well made game is infuriating,Negative
Intel,yeah this is the new standard,Neutral
Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.  At some point GPUs will be so powerful and game engines will have RT in the bag that RT will be used in basically all indie games...and then suddenly nobody will talk about RT anymore because RT is in everything for years.",Positive
Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral
Intel,Don't forget about Frame Gen too. IMO that's the worst part because that means it's 30 fps without it. Imagine the input latency...,Negative
Intel,The actual true crime here is even having fsr to begin with. It should just have dlss,Negative
Intel,Seems like they tried to cover every basis with these.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah it's kinda weird, even games that had a massive difference of performance when using dual channel RAM never listed it on their requirements :/",Negative
Intel,"I've noticed that many developers do this, for some reason developers seem to have some kind of secret passion for the 1070 lol",Positive
Intel,It's because the minimum settings is with software RT enabled and thus they're using the fastest cards without hardware RT that can reach 1080p30 FSR2.,Neutral
Intel,"GCN support is over, RDNA1 is the lowest currently supported arch.",Negative
Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.   Either the game runs like shit on AMD hardware, or the system requirements are wrong and they just write down the components that they tested with.   Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative
Intel,"They're not, those are the cheapest/slowest GPUs that have 8 GB of VRAM. Clearly game devs are done pandering to people who bought Nvidia's e-waste.",Negative
Intel,What do you mean forced raytracing?,Neutral
Intel,1440 + upscaling looks better than 1080p because you're on a 1440 resolution monitor.   Do you even 1440p?,Positive
Intel,"Honestly RT has a lot of fluff and the majority of which is the most costly for the least amount of noticeable fidelity increase. Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt. If games only leverage certain aspects of RT then the performance is still comparable, that's also why the 3080 and 6800XT perform similarly in Fortnite with full RT/nanite/lumen settings.",Neutral

Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative

Intel,"Mirage is PS4 game, Avatar is PS5",Neutral
Intel,"Update: I must've read that wrongly somewhere! Apparently, it uses their own Snowdrop Engine 😳  Well AC: Mirage is nowhere near a next-gen game.

So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Positive
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative

The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies.

Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral

Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Negative
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral
Intel,console games started upscaling way before PCs .,Negative
Intel,This sub is rife with crazy conspiracy theories. I don't think it was this insane a couple years back.,Negative
Intel,you forgot who owns one of the most popular engines out there?,Neutral
Intel,"I guess technically it would count but then everyone would flame it for looking bad. But seriouly, what happened when Ultra settings ran real smooth on top of the line hardware? Gone those times.",Negative
Intel,downvoted by devs lol,Neutral
Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Positive
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Negative
Intel,"Wait so we are finally getting games made only with ray tracing in mind? This is actually great, 2023 is officially the year the new generation started",Positive
Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is some (if not most) games have such a bad TAA it might as well be true, and if often cannot but turned off.",Negative
Intel,"""We could"" but not profitable. Just let imagine these games does not exist in our reality.",Negative
Intel,You didn't understand. It's another Swiss knife engine,Negative
Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Positive
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Positive
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral
Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Negative
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Negative
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Negative
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral

Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral

Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Negative
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

Intel,TRUE! i think 5-10 years was the actual point in time where anybody should have paid their hard earned dollar for raytracing gpus. instead ppl dished out $1000s for the RTX2080/Ti and now are sitting on them waiting for raytracing to happen for them xD,Neutral
Intel,Who knows what new tech will be out in even 4 years lol,Neutral
Intel,"And that’s when I’ll turn on this setting in my games. Fuck having to pay $1600 for a sub 30fps experience. Path tracing is far from being a viable option, it’s more like a proof of concept at this point.",Negative
Intel,"You wish, GPU makers have stagnated like it's crazy, even the graphics have peaked. I expected to see CGI level graphics like Transformers now",Negative
Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Negative
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Positive
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative
Intel,"Same card, I just turned off RT at 4K. 75-120fps is better than 40 with muddy but accurate reflections",Neutral
Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral
Intel,"lol. And you missed the 2080Ti.   Every result under 10 fps is just to be ignored, it isn't representing anything outside of ""woot, the card managed to chuck a frame our way"".",Negative
Intel,That's VRAM for you,Neutral
Intel,we are counting decimals of fps its just all margin of error.,Neutral
Intel,If you buy a card with low ram that card is for right now only lol,Neutral
Intel,Wake me up when a $250 GPU can run this at 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,Well DLSS isn't best. DLAA is,Negative
Intel,Reviews have been saying that the game looks better with DLSS than native. Not to mention runs extremely better.,Positive
Intel,Can’t you just disable TAA? Or do you just have to live with the ghosting?,Negative
Intel,TAA is garbage in everything. TAA and FSR can both get fucked,Negative
Intel,"Yeah. 70 to 100fps on a 4080, but with 3440x1440 and DLSS-quality-FG-RR (nvidia needs new nomenclature....)",Neutral
Intel,"same, high refreshrate at 4k with optimized settings + PT + FG. With a 4080 of course, it's insane that it can look and run this great.",Positive
Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Positive
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral
Intel,Well it's a good thing 99.999999% of PC gamers don't give a shit about ray or path tracing.,Negative
Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Positive
Intel,"Did you try DLSS?  Imagine getting down voted for asking if he was using DLSS. What a fragile community. Sometimes it's okay to use DLSS, other times you better not or people will come to your house with torches",Negative
Intel,VRAM,Neutral
Intel,"Depends on what you are after i guess, is it worth it for me? Absolutely, DLSS+FG+RR with PT is a great experience.",Positive
Intel,still better than 90% of games in 2023,Positive
Intel,Arguably better now Ray Reconstruction has been added. It's quite a big image quality upgrade.,Positive
Intel,"…no it does not, unfortunately. Have you seen the artifacting in Cyberpunk?",Negative
Intel,"Someone ate up the marketing. I often see people wonder why games are so unoptimized today, your answer is right here. \^",Negative
Intel,All graphics you see on your computer screen is fake,Negative
Intel,Path tracing is more demanding than Ray tracing,Negative
Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Positive
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware accelerated physics (as in on the gpu), is different than what's going on the CPU.",Neutral
Intel,hobbies quaint consist aromatic political hat aback boat relieved crush   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Positive
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Negative
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Negative
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative
Intel,AW2 looks insane. Can't wait to play soon,Positive
Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is.

Intel,"It looks better than native even with fsr quality, the Taa in this game is shit",Negative
Intel,You dont need to increase raw performance. You need to increase RT performance.,Neutral

Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Neutral
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive

Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more.

You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good.

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update.

Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative

Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped.

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Positive
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful.

CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT.

Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

Intel,Congratulations on the new gaming laptop. Don’t let people get you down and not everyone has to have the very best to be happy so if it makes you happy then I’m happy for you.,Positive
Intel,"Congrats the 30 series isn't half bad. Laptops aren't bad but gaming desktops add more umph to their performance.

Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral
Intel,There is nothing wrong with laptops I'd build my own if there was a market readily available for it like a desktop.,Neutral
Intel,No!,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't exactly what I'd imagine hearing the words ""gaming rig"" but I'm glad you like it. Happy gaming!",Positive
Intel,Ignore the haters dude. Congratulations on your new gaming laptop. Gaming is something that is supposed to make us happy not cater to snobs. Not everyone needs 4k 60fps. If it satisfies your requirements it's the best rig for you. I have a Ryzen 5 2500u and I game on that so I am super happy for you.,Positive

Intel,"Yeah I'm just happy to be able to start playing around on some games on PC now. I've wanted to play flight simulator on pc instead of my xbox for ages now becuase of all the addons,and now i'll have access to those :D",Positive
Intel,"3050ti isn't really low end. And it will do for everything I need it for. I have an Xbox too for the most modern stuff.  People think that everyone has to have 4k 60fps in every game these days and not everyone needs or wants that, especially in a first machine.",Positive
Intel,"for you maybe, this fits my needs perfectly.",Positive
Intel,"Yup I am more than happy!  I've only ever had and played with integrated graphics on any other laptop I've had so this is a huge step for me.  I will play most brand new stuff on my Xbox for the best ecperience but stuff like KF2 I can now play a 1080p ultra and get 100s frames, could only play that before at 900p low.",Positive
Intel,Well you say that right now but one day a game you really wanna play will come and your pc will be shitting itself trying to run it. If I had the money I would buy the best rig.   But if you don’t have a lot of money like me it’s all about price/performance,Negative
Intel,That is the important that you are happy but still the reality is one.  Just enjoy the notebook.,Positive
Intel,"not too similar but I can recommend grabbing dirt rally 2.0 on a steam sale with all DLC for 8€ / $10 or whatever it is, generally games that simulate some things are pretty much at home on PC",Neutral

Intel,I have an Xbox too so I'll be able to play it on there anything that is out of spec.,Neutral
Intel,I have a friend playing Baldurs Gate 3 on a 980/ You don't know what low end is apparently lmfao,Neutral
Intel,It's better than the 1650 and the 2050 though. And they were the other choices.,Positive
Intel,And that is normal the game don't requiere a big gpu to run the game is a mid / low graphics.  Besides the 980 was the top of that generation. The 3050 is the low end of that particular generation.,Neutral
Intel,"Dont let the haters bring you down dude, if you are happy, then enjoy your new laptop!",Positive
Intel,"Both cards are the lowest version of his generation.  Again the notebook is nice but is a low end ""gaming"" notebook and again the point is that you ENJOY IT and play many games.",Negative

Intel,"Yes, but car coolant doesn't enable sub-zero. What else did you have in the freezer, how was the liquid cooled?",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, household freezers get to -18C. Water freezes at 0C, antifreeze freezes at about -25C. So, car coolant in a freezer will get to and hold -18C while staying liquid. So, that's how I did it.",Neutral
Intel,Oh! You put the car coolant to run through a freezer? Wow! Nice,Positive
Intel,I really would like to know how it will compare to AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 (Strix Halo) APU?,Neutral
Intel,That naming scheme really is complete and utter dogshit,Negative
Intel,Sounds like fooz will be getting a taste soon? Christmas or Q1 2026?,Neutral
Intel,Can we just toss random darts at tech words and numbers to assign a different naming scheme to each and every different Intel Product?,Neutral
Intel,I'm looking forward to check how those series will perform!!,Positive
Intel,"This isn't a ""halo"" product. An upgrade to Arrow Lake/Lunar Lake when it comes to iGPU, but not Strix Halo. It won't cost as much as well.",Neutral
Intel,look forward to new APUs,Positive
Intel,Wait for Nova Lake AX. It will have 48 GPU cores instead of 4/8/12.,Neutral
Intel,Likely will be worse since it has only 1/3 the power usage and significantly smaller chip size.,Negative
Intel,"It's meant to confuse you in purpose, so you ignore it and go by the 3/5/7/9 scheme. Marketing success is dependent on the company leading the customers to the way they want it. So it needs to be complex and confusing.",Negative
Intel,"also why is everything in a lake. like really that's the last place you want your chips to be.  and why is it 255k, 285k and so on instead of just 250k and 280k.  and why is it arc xe3 and not just xe3 ahh  so many weird conventions really. no consistency at all. just pure confusion.  apple and nvidia get it right too, it's really not that hard.",Negative
Intel,"'Strix Halo' is lees about being a halo product, because it’s just an AMD internal naming scheme for the set of specific APU products. APUs that will follow 'Strix Halo' will be called 'Gorgon Point'. Since 'Strix Halo' is already out and the Panther Lake in question is about to come out it might be better to compared it to the next AMD 'Gorgon Point' APU line? But I still think it can be compared to 'Strix Halo'. At least I’m looking forward to see the comparison.  Edit: changed 'Strix Point' into 'Gorgon Point' since that’s what I meant.",Neutral
Intel,You’ll be waiting till 2027 on the amd side.,Neutral
Intel,All halo iGPUs are way too overpriced. Even regular iGPUs are overpriced going into $1K laptops.   And if you want to spend that money you can do it today with Strix Halo.,Negative
Intel,"Lesser power usage doesn’t always equals to performance losses.  See the Apple Axx SOCs and the Qualcomm snapdragon SOCs.  Even with the x86-CPUs over time they had more performance gains while maintaining almost the same power consumption.  Not anymore, but they could catch up with better chip design?",Neutral

Intel,"> APUs that will follow 'Strix Halo' will be called 'Strix Point'.  What? No, that's not what any of these terms mean. The Strix lineup is already out. ""Strix Halo"" is literally their halo, big compute/iGPU product.  PTL will compete with normal Strix Point and its refresh next year.",Neutral
Intel,Really? This should be good for Intel in 2026.,Positive
Intel,These Halo iGPUs are meant for LLM first and foremost. If you just want to game just get a normal RTX laptop.,Neutral
Intel,They are like 20% more efficient.  You are talking about 200% more efficient if it hits the same performance.    They might as well make it a mobile chip if that is how good it is. Would be great on phones.  Would be better than most pcs right now on 5W envolope.,Positive
Intel,"It's intentional, and non specific. So most go by the 3/5/7/9 naming. In order for them to have max profit, they need to lead you to the chips they want you to buy.",Neutral
Intel,'Strix Halo' is a product line as 'Gorgon Point' is also/another product line. Both have different variants.

Intel,"Yes, Strix Point lives *alongside* Strix Halo. Strix Point is already out, and came out *before* Strix Halo at that. It is not the followup to Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,You are right. I meant 'Gorgon Point'.,Neutral
Intel,"Gorgon point is just a refresh of strix point. These terms mean less in the next gen anyway as the follow on products have quite different names. Medusa point isn't really the successor to gorgon point, for example.",Neutral

Intel,I think B770 is locked in and to release shortly isn't it? sure I saw a leak of packaging details etc.,Neutral
Intel,"We finally got reviews for the B50 and it is a SFF gem! That said… I wish Intel would get better at promoting upcoming products, they seem to be slowed down by the restructuring.  I’m going with the flow, whatever will be will be. I’m waiting for Dividends to kick back in so I can retire with Intel.",Positive
Intel,"Boy, I am glad they picked an easy naming convention.   /s  After Xe, Xe1, Xe2 no doubt next would be Xe3, then Xe3p  After A-series, B-series, no doubt next would be C-series.    Too bad those generations do not line up",Positive
Intel,Intel is not serious with dGPUs,Negative
Intel,"If it was coming, you expect them to talk about the future even a little bit. Instead, nothing.    They cancelled Celestial over a year ago now. Sounds like things haven't improved since.",Negative

Intel,"Yes, they are literally just playing. It's all a game lol",Neutral
Intel,"They have released about the same number recently as AMD, I'd say they're pretty serious. The B50 is a pretty compelling product too, big features for the price.",Positive

Intel,"They cancelled Celestial over a year ago now. Sounds like things haven't improved since.   MLID people showing themselves.  Tom Peterson previously said Celestial discrete hardware was already done and they were working on Druid. So if they cancelled it, it must have really sucked.  I am sure after they release Celestial 70 series beater, MLID will come and say they cancelled the 90 series beater and it's for sure dead from now on!",Negative
Intel,Where did you hear that it was cancelled?,Neutral
Intel,"We are supposed to get B60s also but they will likely be very limited and part of Battlematrix. Intel is moving very slow with Pro and Consumer GPUs and they can’t rely on TSMC for supply and obviously are not ready to manufacture through IFS? We are getting left in the dark, all we can do is wait.",Negative
Intel,There has been no update regarding celestial dGPUs internally.,Negative
Intel,AMD is skipping a generation to focus on the next. Intel has lost its focus on GPUs. These are not the same things.,Negative
Intel,Lol no. ARC was 0 margin product. Now it's fate depends on the whims of VPs not engineers.,Negative

Intel,"> MLID people showing themselves.  I'm not getting this from MLID.  > Tom Peterson previously said Celestial discrete hardware was already done  No, that's absolutely false. Actually watch the interview instead of reading reddit comments. He said Xe3 (specifically in PTL), not Celestial, was done. And this was after the PTL tapeout was announced, so that didn't even tell us anything new.   And as we now know, they don't consider that even in the same family as what would be Celestial.",Negative
Intel,Ex-Intel coworkers/acquaintances.,Neutral
Intel,>There has been no update regarding celestial dGPUs internally.  Do you have internal information?,Negative
Intel,Why would they? Battlemage is not even finished. Battlemage is not even 1 year old yet. They will still release B7XX gpus and probably B3XX.  I expect them to tallk about celestial by next year.,Neutral
Intel,> Intel has lost its focus on GPUs  So despite them repeatedly telling you they have not... they have?,Neutral
Intel,"Battle mage is not a 0 margin product...  I know how much silicon cost etc due to my job. Believe me there is at least %30 gross margin in Battlemage and that is assuming somehow Intel got a worse price compared to my small ass company.     It's not profitable due to amount of R&D it takes to develop it, Intel earns a significant chunk for each Battlemage sold. They are simply not as greedy as Nvidia and AMD to earn market share.",Negative
Intel,Dude XE3 even has some test shipment reports etc. It's too late to cancel.   Sure if it's not good maybe we will only see B580 replacement.    But it's literally impossible and stupid to cancel it right now. Especially given how much gross profit they made from B580,Negative

Intel,"No, I don't listen to them, they have a nasty habit of downplaying bad situations. I'm going by their actions.",Negative
Intel,"> Dude XE3 even has some test shipment reports etc  Celestial wasn't base Xe3, and didn't tape out before cancellation. What test shipments are you referring to? PTL?  Btw, they still aren't saying anything about BMG G31, and that was much further along than Celestial was.   > But it's literally impossible and stupid to cancel it right now.  You can cancel a product at any point before it's released. Anything else would be sunk cost fallacy. Surely you're aware of the massive budget cuts and layoffs they've announced.

Intel,No. Or at least not from any reliable source. Obviously discounting MLID and his ilk.,Negative
Intel,Why would Intel tell you? It would just stall selling all current ARC cards.,Negative
Intel,"You don't even know that?   Lip Bu has been hiring gpu designers not firing them.   Most of the Cuts are from foundry side and slightly from gaudi side.    Intel if anything is focusing on gpus to create AI inference gpus.    Only potential explanation would be only cutting consumer graphics but that doesn't make much sense as they are very familiar.      You should check your sources, Lip Bu would cut 14A before he cuts Inference gpu side.",Neutral
Intel,BMG was 0 margin product,Negative
Intel,"> You don't even know that?  What do you claim I do not know?  > Lip Bu has been hiring gpu designers not firing them.

Intel,"It wasn't though?  As far as you guys go Arc was cancelled, battlemage was cancelled now it's Celestial?  I don't believe there is nothing Intel can do convince you. I heard these news every single time.     Also just look at job listings, there is many for gpu development.",Negative

Well yes, if they cancel a project, and I know they have, I'll say they cancelled it. The way Intel can convince me to say otherwise is by... not cancelling projects. And you *do* realize they haven't talked about client dGPUs past BMG in many, many months, right? It's not like Intel's really denying anything.  I'm not sure what you're looking for here. Should I lie and pretend not to know what I do? To what end? It's not like Intel's harmed by me saying they cancelled such a project. That's not something you can keep a secret indefinitely, and anyone who *really* cares already knows.  > Also just look at job listings, there is many for gpu development.  If you lay off 10 people, 5 more leave on their own, and then you backfill 4, that's still a net loss. They still need some people, but not as many as they had, and not for client dGPU.",Negative
Intel,"Intel have not claimed there to be upcoming Celestial, or more Battlemage or anything like it. How did their silence convince you of anything?",Negative
Intel,Actually after the Nvidia deal there's definite reason for Intel to cancel future ARC development.  They have a partner that makes better GPU than them. Why would they continue? If the Nvidia deal is successful I expect even their iGPU will disappear.  In no sense it makes sense to develop a line that's redundant with what your partner is doing.,Negative
Intel,Think pretty easy naming. Any X infront just automatically means better iGPU,Positive
Intel,"Looks pretty snappy at \~75% faster than the top-end LNL chipset and this is with pre-release drivers.  Granted TDP is probably higher.  If they get the drivers cleaned up then it might release a bit higher which makes it a viable (though still materially weaker) thin and light XX50 dGPU model alternative some some of the market.  Should do well addressing the 'I want a thin and light laptop, but I want it to have an ok GPU' crowd.",Negative
Intel,"Nice to see the G14 with an Intel CPU. Thought the lineup was AMD only tbh, while the larger G16 laptops get Intel.",Positive
Intel,"Panther Lake 12 Xe3 performance looks great to match RTX 3050 laptop performance because the entire chip only draw half power of RTX 3050. Seems like using 18A BPD really paid of to reduce CPU consumption by a lot with the helps of Tsmc N3E for iGPU.    Also it's so weird to see Asus Zephyrus G14 with Intel chip, usually it always has Amd CPU paired with Nvidia GPU. I heard G14 is pretty popular gaming laptop but this laptop during full load can use 120w+ power.    Using Panther Lake 12 Xe3 will makes this laptop looks even more appealing because it reduces power requirements from 120w+ to 45w but still giving about the same GPU performance which is insane. This is a massive game changer for people who use laptop as portable gaming machine and to those who travel a lot. I can totally understand why Asus this time use Panther Lake for G14.",Positive

Intel,"Nah, should've kept that info at the end like every other Intel and AMD CPU ever made.  But otherwise this branding really feels like AMDs APU line, where they had to emphasize their iGPU was better than average.",Neutral
Intel,"The possibility of being nearly 100% faster than Lunar Lake in some tasks, and minimum possibly 50% faster while being able to fit it into a sub 3lb/1.5kg design with a 80+wH battery is going to really nice.

The average user understands the difference between, say, a Core Ultra 5 and 7, because the ideal of 3, 5, 7, 9 being product tiers exist in plenty of industries, like BMW's product line.

Intel,"To summarize from the article for some folks:  6300 puts this GPU as 33.4% faster than the 140V, 71.3% faster than the 890M, and 54.3% of the 8060S. Just over half of Strix Halo's top config.  Bear in mind though, that this benchmark favors ARC GPUs compared to gaming results. The 140V and 890M are roughly equal and this benchmark puts the 140V as 28.4% faster.",Neutral

Intel,"It really is a mess, someone should've been fired long ago.",Negative
Intel,"The only thing they want you to care about is 3/5/7/9.  If the naming is too clear, then they can't steer you to the higher margin/profit variants. At some level it needs to be unclear. Not defending them, but how things are.",Negative
Intel,Intel wasn't a static target since the 10th gen. They've been pushing (at least in terms of performance) since then. It's mostly the efficiency which stepped back. And they messed up their current lineup in terms of performance and pricing but they've improved for sure.  Next gen seems good for them though. Hope they price it well. AMD isn't zen 1/2 either. They're bumping core numbers too and introducing some new cores as well.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, why?  Is AMD going to be coming out with anything more powerful than the HX 370 in that power range?",Neutral
Intel,because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 50% more performance.,Neutral
Intel,"There are so many variables here that we have no way of accurately saying that.  It's possible that Xe3 is simply treated more like RDNA in this benchmark, and that the Xe2 140V is unfairly biased towards in that way. If that is the case, the 890M and 8060S may be better metrics to base off, and we do see over 50% gains for a 50% wider GPU than the 890M.  It's also possible this is a power-limited scenario. Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.  This could be pre-release drivers not getting the true 100% out of the hardware or silicon with non-final clocks still being tuned. The point is there's no way to know for sure.",Neutral
Intel,I don’t understand why you people continue to use that MSI claw to demonstrate “intel improved lunar lake performance post launch” when there are millions of lunar lake laptops that never had performance issue of that one handheld.,Negative
Intel,"they're keeping their jobs because this is technically better than the past. back in the day you'd have model numbers exclusive to a retail store, much less specific to an OEM, because businesses wanted to feel like they got a bespoke deal.   These days the SKU naming is mostly for accounting purposes, while the ""real"" naming decisions are made by the OEMs. basically most people are buying the Thinkpad/Yoga/ROG ""brand"" rather than the specific processor model, which only a much smaller crowd bothers to comprehend. It's like how people buy the Steamdeck rather than whatever APU is in there, which is fairly old at this point.",Neutral
Intel,"Energy efficiency is huge in mobile but I was explicit in saying they were no longer a static target in graphics, where they were not making significant or impressive gains in iGPUs for many years, it seemed. Now they are making one of the best iGPUs on the market.",Positive
Intel,"Possibly yes.   Current AMD handheld chips are better than Lunar Lake performance. Assuming normal cadence. Next generation would be similar performance to Panther Lake.     I was hoping more of a leap frog, rather than similar performance. %50 would be a very clear edge.",Positive

Intel,FTFY: because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 35-40% more performance.  Cause it don't scale linearly.,Neutral
Intel,"Mostly because people with LNL laptops are less likely to games since gaming are not the point of those laptops -> less testing, whereas the Claw 8 AI+ is a gaming PC handheld, so it is mostly use for gaming purpose and thus have more people testing for its performance.",Neutral
Intel,"As weird as it sounds actually Lunar Lake improvement mainly comes from MSI Claw not laptop, that because majority people who use MSI Claw give feedback the most which is why Intel focusing on the handheld first then laptop.    Intel even use Claw as benchmark for Lunar Lake compared to laptop. You can read from this article :  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/   Also Claw got BIOS update way faster than any laptop with the same chip so it helps Intel to mitigate power and boost behavior to maximize the performance. There is so many bug reports on Arc forum, most of them are Claw users, that's why laptop got benefits too.",Positive
Intel,AMD isn’t coming out with a better next gen iGPU for mobile (Gorgon Point) since it’s a simple refresh. Same arch with same CU count based on rumors.  The generation after will be competing with Nova Lake,Negative
Intel,"Amd handheld with Z2E isn't better than Intel Lunar Lake, you can see the comparison on MSI Claw sub or even on youtube. Z2E in most game is 10% slower than Core Ultra 7 258V, it only won in the game where Intel GPU performs bad.    Not to mention at 17w Z2E losing badly to 258V, Intel is on their own league, it's not even competition for Amd.",Negative
Intel,Intel is gonna have better integrated graphics than AMD,Positive
Intel,I have no idea.,Neutral
Intel,"We don't know what TDP was run here, and both MTL amd ARL H have been 28W outside of the Ultra 9 SKUs. It's entirely possible this was run at 28W, which is also in reach of Lunar Lake's boost envelope.",Neutral
Intel,The lunar lake laptops are tested by reviewers all the same as the strix point ones. Regardless it’s misleading because it’s not “lunar lake” but rather the performance profile/boost behaviour of that specific MSI CLAW that was changed and people act like it’s lunar lake’s drivers doing “30% magic”.   It’s not.,Negative
Intel,"And is there documented so-called “large” performance improvements on LNL systems that already performed as expected on day one (it tied 890m on high power and was always better at low power, talking about real games not 3dmark)? Or was it only bringing the Claw back to where LNL should always perform?",Neutral
Intel,"True. I don't see how the next igpu from Amd going to use rdna 4, it won't even support fsr 4. Meanwhile Intel going to push their igpu tech even further with XeSS XMX 3 with Xe3 and Xe3P, they will be way ahead of Amd in igpu market especially when Intel Lunar Lake already beating Amd Strix Point and Z2E.

Intel,"When is the panther lake reveal going to be, CES?",Neutral
Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal. Both frequency and sequential optimizations (like multi-level branch prediction) scale poorly.  Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though. So seeing the benefits to E cores for gaming requires 1.) e-cores exist for a while 2.) some games optimize for them.  Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Negative
Intel,It's either N3P or 18AP.,Neutral
Intel,That’s why rumors want Intel to throw away P-cores (Israel team) and only keep E-cores (Austin) to make Titan lake a unified core with only E-cores remaining.,Neutral
Intel,>and games are getting more multithreaded.  Can you give me a few AAA examples of modern games which get a noticeable improvement in AVG. FPS or 0.1/1% lows when using more than 8cores/16 thread's ? I'm genuinely curious which games you are talking about.,Neutral
Intel,"Really should focus on the Main/Sub thread part. Most games will usually only load up 1-3 cores, with the rest of the cores only used for incidental workloads with lower priority and sync requirements (Multithreading is hard yo, Multithreading with latency requirements is mindnumbing).  This makes plenty of games very suitable for the P/E architecture, as long as you have enough P cores for the Main threads, the E cores will be perfectly sufficient.",Neutral
Intel,"Energy Star probably won't be around for too much longer, at least in it's current form.  https://www.npr.org/2025/08/13/nx-s1-5432617/energy-star-trump-cost-climate-change",Neutral
Intel,That makes me imagine in a different reality if Xbox had remained with Intel and NVIDIA and their next generation would use an Intel E-core based SoC with NVIDIA chiplet.,Neutral
Intel,It has already happened. Stephen Robinson - heading the Austin team - is now the lead x86core architect.,Neutral
Intel,"Off the top of my head, Starfield, Bannerlord, BeamNG, UE5 games due to how the rendering pipeline works, etc.",Neutral
Intel,"Most games of the past will only load up a few cores, but that's beginning to change. Cyberpunk 2.0 loads up 16 threads/cores easily, and some others like Battlefield 6 also scale pretty well. If you have less than 16 threads on fast cores like Panther Lake and Arrow Lake, then you can run into issues. Or if your 16 threads are on one die and any spillover has to go across the SoC die like with AMD and probably Nova Lake.",Neutral

Intel,I'm tired of AMD slop consoles and handhelds,Negative
Intel,">Starfield  [Not really](https://youtu.be/BcYixjMMHFk?t=1015), game doesn't benefit from more cores/threads.  >Bannerlord  Sadly, there's no benchmarks of different CPUs that I could find for this specific game, but I do know that this game heavily relies on a good CPU, but without decent data(review), which shows multiple CPUs tested, it's hard to understand the benefits of more cores/threads,  >UE5 games due to how the rendering pipeline works  It's true that UE5 can utilize 8 cores / 16 threads, but more than that? I'm not sure, if possible, provide a review/video which shows that UE5 scale with more cores/threads, so far, it seems that it is limited at 8c/16t - big channels rarely add UE5 games to their CPU benchmarks, but I found Remnant 2,[ and it doesn't show any benefits](https://youtu.be/3n537Z7pJug?t=1056) of more than 8 cores.  I heard that ""games are getting more multithreaded"" like 4-5 years ago, and in most cases, it wasn't true, with more than 8c/16t almost no games scale on CPU-side, and even when they do, in most cases it's a minor improvement over 8c/16t configuration, like 1-3%.",Negative
Intel,"UE5 by default does not support multithreading well. actually I don't think async shader is even considered a default feature yet despite being added two years ago. Only the editor compilation step uses all threads, but it doesn't need to react to user input so it would be more surprising if it didn't use all threads.  If you're seeing good thread use in a UE5 game is thanks to the developer breaking up work with their own engine changes.",Negative
Intel,"Considering AMD’s lag in gaming performance especially in ray tracing, I would be totally onboard with that.",Positive
Intel,Huh????,Neutral
Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,"To be fair, Sony seems to be fed up with AMD lagging behind and are pushing them to do better. Consoles will likely continue to stick with AMD, at least for the next generation. Intel graphics aren't quite ready yet, and Nvidia is going to be way to expensive unless they take an old SoC and repurpose it like Nintendo.",Neutral
Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral
Intel,">Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X  I said ""can and will"" not that every game is going to benefit from it.  Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

It's not like we have to guess what is what is big and what is coming. We know and what's coming is more AI and more graphical experiences.

Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.  That uses some power and silicon.  3. Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.

Intel,"They've tested it with just three AMD cpus. Weird pairings. I would pair B580 with any i5 from last couple years. Seriously their testing is getting less and less ""real life"" and more for the purpose of a good clickbait.",Negative
Intel,"I couldn’t believe the video I was watching, the thumbnail was pure clickbait. They fixed one game, and improved some others a little.  And NEVER an Intel CPU in sight. I like the B580, but it deserves better ""testing"" than this.",Negative
Intel,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Negative
Intel,"Is this related to historically Intel compiler not compiling code efficiently for AMD cpus? Does it also make Intel CPUs overhead better? If yes, then they really fixed something. If no, then they wrote code normally for AMD cpus as well as Intel cpus.",Neutral
Intel,"the B580 is a modern gpu, it should be paired with a modern cpu, preferably an Intel one, going with old school Ryzen cpus is a bad path to take.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is that this title makes it sound like they fixed the cpu overhead issue in every game, but that's not the case. Some games are still affected. Obviously any fix is better than nothing, but depending on what games you want to play, you will still see an overhead issues. It is nice though that in some of the games the overhead problem has been addressed though.",Negative

Intel,"It's meant to test low end, mid and high end.",Neutral
Intel,"The exact CPU model is hardly relevant. The point was to show CPUs of a certain power level. Not sure how this makes it less ""real life"" as if all three CPUs shown weren't extremely popular for their time. Also not sure what one would achieve when using Intel CPUs specifically.",Negative
Intel,"These guys absolutely *refuse* to test with an Intel CPU, it's very weird.",Negative
Intel,"5700x would have made a lot of sense compared to 5600  12400f,13400f should be included as well",Neutral
Intel,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Negative
Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.      I would very much like to see the comparison   i5-12400, i5-13400, i5-13500, Ryzen 5 5600(X)",Positive
Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render. (at least as far as my debugging could lead me)  (that's also why its less impacted on ddr5 systems no matter what CPU),Neutral
Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative

Intel,Do you have peer-review data that confirms it?,Neutral
Intel,The video shows the B580 not having driver overhead issues with the 5600X but we don't know if it did previously on anything other than Spider-Man. His tone suggests the 5600X performance used to be worse but he provides no data other than Spider-Man to suggest it was for other games.,Neutral
Intel,The fact that a switch from a 5600 to a 5700 with hardly a frequency gain eliminates the overhead issue suggest that is kind of  how games/drivers work.,Neutral
Intel,Which also fixed performance on 5600X,Neutral
Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees. AKA you can have mainthread use 100% of core 0, but cores 1,2,3,4,5 are all 50% used, leaving 50% for other tasks to run freely.",Neutral
Intel,"Eventually you get the drivers where they need to be. People love to whine about Arc drivers but on the iGPU side people never complained. The community is never, ever happy with anything.

Intel,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

At SOME point, you WILL have a bottleneck in the machine). It's about managing them. You want the bottleneck to be appropriately sized for your needs, and placed where you want it (i.e. the performance disparity between a 9060 XT 16GB and a 7800X3D on a 1080p display is reasonably small, and you want the graphics card to be the limitation when possible).

AMD,"Yep.  Running a Noctua U12S from years ago on a 200W 5900xt with an OC/UV. No issues.   However, case and fans are more important.  Air coolers need an  uninterrupted path of air. Modern fishtanks don't work right. And cases without proper airflow struggle. A shit case can work with a giant 360mm AIO. Not with an air cooler.",Neutral

AMD,My thermal right PA120 is doing a great job on my 9800x3d. Most of the time playing it sits at 60C and at 100 load it goes to about 70C range which it rarely does except when prerendering a game for example. I also have exceptionally bad airflow into my case.,Positive
AMD,Average air coolers are on par with average AIO's  Nowadays just comes down to what you want for your build aesthetically.,Neutral
AMD,"Fine as in “not thermal throttle”? If that’s the expectation most reputable brand’s dual tower air cooler will do.   However, AIO, especially 280/360, have significant advantages when it comes to noise to performance under sustained heavy load. If you don’t mind your PC sounds like a jetliner taking off, or you wear headphones anyway, you typically don’t need AIO.  But some of the thermalright 360 AIO are surprisingly price competitive even up against their own air cooler, can’t speak for its longevity but performance wise they are definitely worth considering.  Just avoid 120 AIO as they sometimes perform worse than air cooler, unless you are building a SFF build and short of space for air cooler.",Neutral
AMD,I switched from AIO to air cooling and got better temps on my 9800X3D by about 10°C. Very much can handle high end CPUs.    I had a Corsair 280mm Titan AIO and moving into new home with poor AC in the office caused hotter room ambient temps which resulted in higher CPU temps. I looked into and after some research landed on a ThermalRight Phantom Spirit EVO 120mm air cooler and plugged it in and immediately saw about 4°C cooler. After some fan curves adjustments I got it down to as much as 10°C than what I could get my AIO.    Noise is nearly the same with the new fan curves as my AIO was which is basically silent even under full load and only real difference I noticed was my AIO would regulate temps as it got hotter or cooler but took longer to cool down whereas the air cooler has more temp spikes but cools a lot faster.,Positive
AMD,"If you're gaming and it isnt a 4090 or 5090, just use the 9700X. Save money, and you'll never notice a difference. Even in non gaming, you'll probably never notice unless youre doing the high end stuff.",Positive
AMD,"Usually yes, 9000 series are pretty cool cpus",Positive

AMD,100% fine. Cpu temp's being hotter is really not something to be concerned about its all a mind game at this point between years ago and newer tech today. There is a performance aspect too it but in the end 99.99% of cpu's that have issues down the road will be because voltage/bios/setting issues or physical parts like the vrm's failing and killing the cpu then riding the thermal limit of the cpu,Neutral

I keep it set to stock 65W TDP (88W) with PBO.and undervolt, and temps are good under load (55C). I'm just surprised how hot it gets so fast at 105W TDP.

AMD,"I have an old gtx660ti 2 pipe heatsink and as an experiment I decided to hold a dual jet lighter against it (you know them lighters which make nice blue cones of flame).  The water from the combustion in the flames condenses onto the heat spreader about 5mm away from the edge of the flames. No amount of time holding them flames to the surface will cause the water to evaporate off again.  I can immediately take the flame off and put my hand to the point I'd been trying to heat for minutes and it does feel like it's warmer than air temperature but it's by no means ""warm"".   And that's without any fans on the heatsink.  Air coolers are just evaporation coolers really.  What matters is keep the air in your case cool. Which is why I have a positive pressure fine nylon mesh filtered 4 in, 1 out (to encourage exhaust out of the case on the peerless assassin 120 I use) mesh case. Dust finds it hard to get in, and it's easy to blow out, all the extra fans intaking make sure the case is always at room temperature and the exhaust encourages the airflow to go through the cooler even without the CPU fans.",Neutral

AMD,Absolutely.,Neutral
AMD,"Typically mine hovers around 84° or so but I've hit thermal limits now and then depending on the weather, even on the 5700x using the NH-D15, and it was transcoding jobs.  I have a 5900x that has a 360 rad AIO and it is much harder to hit limits.  Actually come to think of it I think the 5700x is 95° while the 5900x is only 90°.  Weird.",Neutral
AMD,"That's probably true regarding the 4K, I agree.  Typically CPU rendering ends up with a smaller file compared to NVENC, with higher quality to boot.  I keep falling back to Handbrake over alternatives, perhaps because I have custom presets I've made that I like.",Neutral

AMD,"While I agree that the PS is usually more than enough for a 9800x3d, there are of course many other factors.  - Room temperature   - airflow and number of fans in the case  - A founder edition Nvidia 5000 series GPU blows its hot air up to the CPU instead of out the back. That could make a huge difference",Neutral
AMD,"I only see limitations in cinebench, never in gaming.   If I use curve optimizer, pbo, and +200, I can get 5425 on all cores with 9800x3d   But if I just use pbo, I end up losing 10% performance vs pbo, co, and +200",Negative

AMD,"I have mine on a curve but they rarely ramp up very high at all. I'm also on a custom loop with triple 360s and the loudest noise it makes is the occasional PSU fan firing up. I'm sure turning the front fans up a hair would fix it entirely, I just can't be bothered",Negative

Personally I can't stand the hours long encoding jobs anymore, mostly why I went GPU-only for almost everything, but definitively understand people still using CPU for it too.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, 7800X3Ds were extra efficient because they kinda had to be, since the thermal path from cores through the cache chips to get to the heat spreader and eventually the heatsink wasn't great, therefore had to run somewhat conservative clock speeds and voltages compared to the non-X3D 7xxx models (and was also locked so you couldn't even attempt overclocking). 9xxxX3D has better thermal contact from cores through to heatsink so can run higher speeds and therfore worse out of the box efficiency with the higher power, but it can get more performance out of it.",Neutral

AMD,"Max my 9800X3d ever saw in Prime95 was 85c with the PS120SE.   So you either have a low-binned chip, or something else is wrong like fan curve or something in the BIOS could be tweaked to better improve temps. Ambient temps also play an important factor. I keep my house sitting at 72F.   My max fan usage is 80% when temps hit above 75c. Between 20-50c, fans are 40% and 50% from 50-75c. Fans are barely audible.",Neutral

I had a 7950x3d and went up to a 9800x3d. Still an amazing streaming and gaming setup.   The 9950x3d boosts like 200mhz higher than the 9800x3d but it can be complicated with so many cores and some apps and games not choosing the right ones. I had the threat scheduling program I cant think of the name, but the 9800x3d has none of those issues and is much cheaper and basically the same performance.   So theres no real worry you'll run out of threads on it especially when you take streaming out of it.",Positive

Very few use 8 cores, and only a literal handful could even manage to use more than that - if that was the case, then you'd already know if you needed a 9950.   Running 2 browser instances doesnt even register as a blip for even 1 core to be fully utilized.   Running an ultrawide display, is more about GPU capabilities than CPU.

AMD,Should really make no meaningful difference since you'll almost certainly use the GPU (eg. NVENC) for encoding so the CPU barely has to do anything in relation to streaming.,Neutral
AMD,"You shouldnt be using the CPU to render/encode your streams - is slow an inefficient.   GPUs have their own dedicated encoder that takes frames from the frame buffer that have already been rendered.   Most streamers, the ones that are actually gaming... are still streaming and gaming from their 1 PC and it does it very well with using the GPU to do the work.   Its fast, highly efficient, and unless the streaming platform you're streaming on even allows you to have a bitrate thats in the 10,000-12,000+ to run higher resolutions where the bitrate would actually matter.... CPU rendering is useless. The only streamers that even have such bitrates available to stream at, at the ones who are pulling in tens thousands of viewers each stream, whom are on a consistent schedule that justifies the platform in unlocking that ability. And even most of those aren't game streamers, they're talking heads with a mostly static image coming from their $800+ DSLR face cam.   The average streamer, even if you run a podcast that has 1-5k viewers every stream... are usually locked to 6000 and below. I think on Twitch you're limited to a bitrate of 3500 and only until you meet certain thresholds will they even allow you to hit 6000.    The only time anyone should be using their CPU to encode for streaming, is when you're running a dual-PC streaming setup so that 1 PC runs the stream, alerts, overlays and transitions, recording and transcoding - so that the gaming PC's resources are not taking away from the performance of the gaming PC. And even then in a dual-PC setup - its just better to be letting the GPU on the Stream PC to be doing all that work.",Neutral
AMD,"Hmmm, let's  think.  The Ultra 9 is on a platform that has no future, it's ""dead"", there is no opportunity to drop in the next gen Intel cpu.  The Ultra trails both your current cpu in many games and it trails many of the AMD cpu's.   The Ultra is obliterated by the AMD x3d chips.    The one advantage the Ultra has is in productivity apps.  The 9950x3d goes toe to toe with the Ultra 9 in productivity apps:  a little faster in some, a little slower in others.  The Ultra cannot compare with the 9950x3d in gaming.  The vcache side of 9950x3d is actually a 9800x3d. The 9950x3d also obliterates the Ultra in gaming, because, well it is a 9800x3d when gaming.  Both the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d are on the AM5 platform.  AMD will run its next generation of cpu's, Zen6, on the AM5 platform.  Reliable sources report that Zen7 will also be AM5.  If you go with a chip setting on the AM5 platform (e.g. 9950x3d), you have the opportunity to simply drop in a Zen6 then a Zen7 cpu and have a modern and relevant machine for another 5+ years.  Intel only dreams of this!  The price delta between the 9950x3d and the 9800x3d is about $200.  If you have any doubts, get the 9950x3d.   Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.    I was considering a 9800x3d vs a 9950x3d, I went with the 9950x3d.   Precisely because I want to know I have the flexibility to do more than game.  From a price to performance ratio for gaming, the 9800x3d is the winner.

AMD,"Nope. I've always been Intel, but I'm switching over to AMD when I get my next paycheck.",Neutral
AMD,"There is nothing in your use case that would make the Ultra 9 a better choice than the 9800x3d. Same for the 9950x3d, the 9800x3d is the clear best choice and the second best choice would 7800x3d",Neutral
AMD,Its a dead socket.   So no upgrade path when Intel releases their next-gen CPU and Socket. You'd be forced to also replace the motherboard if you go with Intel. At least you can keep the same RAM sticks.,Negative
AMD,"Despite my issues with my 9950x3d  Its a 9800x3d when gaming, and you WANT a 9800x3d because it's the best cpu on the planet  Without all the darn issues the dual ccd Cpu's have,  I am an Intel guy and I am telling you  9800x3d is simply the best 👌   Intel for productivity  Amd for gaming   9950x3d if you want to suffer like me And please don't do that",Positive

AMD,"Do these things in the background include multiple overlays for IRacing, music, and other software for numerous peripherals like pedals, wheelsbases etc?",Neutral
AMD,"I'd keep fiddling with it over getting a new CPU unless you really don't care about the money.   If you're going to switch to an 8-core CPU anyway, why not try dropping your 13900 to 8 P-cores, no hyper threading, and a bit of an undervolt. Your cooler is also relevant here but I'm assuming you have something decent?  I made the same changes to my 13700 and a client's 14900 and it's much better now.",Neutral
AMD,"Sounds like your CPU may have been degraded enough if you're having issues with it. 13 and 14th gen CPUs have 2 different issues - 1 is Intel letting motherboard manufacturers pump so much voltage to the CPU to run higher clockspeeds that they degrade really fast. So there were many BIOS updates to correct it, and also add the ""Enforce Intel Limits"" option to actually keep these CPUs operating how they were actually designed. The other problem was manufacturing defect - something about corrosion within the die so you'd have a permanently gimped CPU that no amount of undervolting and capping clockspeeds would ever help.   Might be time to RMA the CPU and get a fresh one from Intel - if yours is still within the warranty period. I would try this option first before trying to replace the entire platform. A brand new fresh CPU for free.... or spending $600-700 for a 9800X3D?  Like any corporation, they'll want to try to deny your claim, but if you pushback they're likely to replace that CPU.",Negative
AMD,"With the 4090 and some background apps, the 9950x3d might actually be worth the money if you don't care about the increased cost.     I hear you might need to manually assign the 3d cores to games though for maximum efficiency though, and I don't think it'll be any better in a meaningful way outside of not overdoing the load on your CPU with background using up assets",Neutral
AMD,"Used to run the same, except a 14900k, plagued with issues and had 2 degraded CPU's replaced with warranty in the span of 7 months, until I had enough and switched to an AMD R9 9950X, smooth sailing since.  Fuck Intel, CPU crashed mid windows update, corrupted everything",Negative
AMD,"Nope, it's roughly the same performance as the 9800x3d in games. The main issue is that the 9950x3d is way more expensive so there's no point spending that much money for bonus productivity that will not be used.",Negative
AMD,"No.   They perform identical in games.   If you're just using your PC primarily for gaming, there is absolutely no reason why you'd need a 16-core/32-thread CPU that doesnt game any better than the 8-core/16-thread 9800X3D.   There's also a nearly $200 price difference between them.   9800X3D retails for $459.   9950X3D retails for $649.    Again, just for gaming.... you really want to spend almost $200 more for a CPU that performs the exact same?  That extra $200 could get you into a whole new tier of GPU. It can mean the difference between a 5070Ti and a 5080. Or a 5070 and 5070Ti.",Neutral

AMD,"Yep, I have tried everything,  I got it working in the end,  But it took me months, and im not bad with pc's too, It's 100% software issues  They just built the software in a retarded way, Its working though windows systems and Xbox game bar + mode  And if gamebar bugs out you need to change registry settings to fix it,  Widows bugs out regularly, changes constantly, Its just waiting for failure at this point,  I wish we had more control over when core parking would activate directly from amd software So windows won't screw with it",Negative
AMD,"Thats great, but have you checked the core parking in several games?",Positive
AMD,"I am really thankful that you want to help me out, But i luckily got it working in the end,  Reinstalling windows was a routine in my 2 months of trouble shooting,  I lived inside bios,  Ripped out components, Replaced all cables, keyboard , mouse, and monitor   Windows 24h2 and 25h2 with and without updates, Stock windows and custom debloated versions,  Tried every single driver from motherboard,  windows, and directly from the manufacturers,  Every single hack, tweak, and fixes found on YouTube, forums, and reddit,  In the end, it was a combination of faults in the bios, Windows being windows, 2 drivers that secretly wouldn't install, and the software AMD itself that's only  fixed by registry settings,  And after all that, it's sometimes still buggy only to be fixed by a pc restart  Luckily,the last one won't happen very often ...so far",Positive
AMD,"The driver works to tell the OS to park the cores unless they're actually needed.  You can easily see this behavior using either task manager or AMD Ryzen Master if you have a second monitor to display it on your while gaming.  The OS will unpark them and allow other processes to use them if they need it, but it tries to keep them idle if possible.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s an 8 core CPU. The 13900 is 8 Performance cores + 16 efficiency cores. It has 32 threads vs the 16 threads on the 9800x3d  Sure the 9800x3d will get a fps boost from the 3d cache when gaming but outside of gaming the 13900k is faster per core and overall. Just look at single threaded and multi threaded core each r23 tests that put the cpus to the test. For multi threaded the 13900k scores in the 38,000 range and 9800x3d scores around 23,000    For single core it’s 2100 for the 9800x3d and 2300 for the 13900k  So technically the 13900k is a faster more capable chip due to having more cores and a good single threaded performance. The only place the 9800x3d will be an improved is in gaming fps thanks to the 3d cache. This is fine if all you do is game and want higher FPS but beyond that, it’s a slower chip in every other way than the 13900k.  The 9950x3d is faster than the 13900k in every way, not just gaming FPS. I’d go that route if it’s in your budget (and I did from a 13900k). It’s a far better chip.   https://en.overclocking.com/test-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/",Neutral
AMD,Yeah multiple midi inputs/controllers while doing a collab in the background over discord. Plus trying to make edits as fast as possible in ableton with all those things going on I'll catch a lot of stutter I dont want anymore. Plus it should handle my version of premire pro like a champ.

AMD,"""some background apps"" amount to very little justification for having a 16core cpu. I think people overestimate what ""multitasking"" really means and think that you can only run a handful of apps before needing a CPU upgrade. RAM matters more to multi-tasking than CPU cores do - unless you actually use your PC to earn a living with - in which case, in a professional setting - yes, the 9950X3D is the BARE MINIMUM you'll want to use.   As a PC used 99% for gaming? No.   I have a 9800X3D and use my PC almost exclusively for gaming - occasionally i'll render or re-encode a video or two but im not running a game at the same time - I like being able to utilize my GPU at full-tilt of around 150fps when I'm re-encoding an 80GB 4K movie down to 10GB so I can watch some movies while I travel. I run multiple browser tabs, discord, a torrent client and sometimes Jellyfin.  The only other stuff running in the background is the typical list of windows processes that everyone has running.   Discord and my browser are chillin on my 2nd monitor and they're basically idle while Im gaming on BF6 or playing Expedition 33. Maybe I have a podcast playing... but that doesnt even fully utilize 1 core.   Unless OP is running a VM or two and/or is actually multi-tasking by letting a video or blender rendering, or some CFD program... a 9950X3D is not going to benefit him at all.  OP's use-case is similar to mine. PC mostly used for gaming with only a handful of typical programs running in conjunction with the primary focus being on a game.  The adage of ""unused RAM is wasted RAM"" would fit perfectly if you swapped ""RAM"" with ""cores"". Unused cores is wasted cores. If OP is only going to be using no more than 6-8 cores... the extra 8 cores are just going to be sitting idle barely registering as a blip.   Its also nearly $200 more expensive.",Neutral
AMD,I'm waiting for 9600x3d,Neutral
AMD,"I am not sure about that. It may cost close to $1000 and it probably only benefit very selected games that needs more compute than 8 cores can offer. In addition, there will still be a lot of context switching costs between the 2 CCDs.  That being said, I found myself to be a potential beneficiary of Ryzen 9 because I like keeping multiple low demand gacha games idling in the background (so I do not need to keep relaunching them). Although these games are both low demand and idling, they typically still fully occupy at least 1 cpu core",Neutral
AMD,"-update Bios and chipset drivers  -windows power settings - balanced   -Update gamebar and make sure it recognizes your game when you launch   To verify, You can pull up resource monitor, then go to gamebar settings and select “recognize this as a game” then when you close and relaunch the program the cpu tab will show half the cores parked.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm well aware of that, but OP stated they will use it 99% for gaming so they should really pick a CPU that does best what they do 99% of the time. That's why I would consider the 9800X3D to be an upgrade. If they did 50/50 gaming and productivity you could definitely argue differently.  I do gaming and quite a bit of other stuff that can benefit from a lot of cores so I would personally get the 9950X3D if I were to upgrade now.",Positive
AMD,"Well the 13900 is a very hot chip so unless you have a 360mm AIO, you're going to have issues running it at full capacity. That's why limiting the cores helps. It's reducing the heat generation so the chip doesn't throttle.  Regardless, if you just feel like replacing the CPU, board, and ram is easier, no worries!",Neutral
AMD,"I suppose fair enough, but the 4090 is full on top tier GPU of its generation and if anything will ever bottleneck a 3d chip at max settings, its one if the two most likely    Also seems like it'll fetch a better resale value if they ever want to upgrade in the far future since it'll be able to handle rendering, and easier to hold if they want to maintain top tier performance keeping it far into the future. $200 is also ram miney right now",Positive
AMD,Read my post closer.,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for trying to help,  But like I said before  I already fixed the problem,  It was difficult to find even for people that knows what they are doing,  If it was this easy, it would not have taken me 2 months to fix,  I don't mean to disrespect or be mean to you, But I am just trying to tell people how much problems can come from the dual ccd Cpu's   I don't want people to need to become full on TI certified just to fix the stupid issues that's not even the fault of the customers  Just to play games.",Negative
AMD,At anything less than 53 cores I crash to bios in the middle of a game. Anything more and it runs but not for long.,Negative
AMD,"Meaningless because 9800X3D edges out the 9950X3D by slim margins, they typically trade blows even if the 9950 has a slightly higher clock speed on the cache CCD.   Typically good performing CPUs always hold their value much better: Look at the used prices of 5700X3D & 5800X3D - they're hitting over $300 and brand new stock that still exists is spiking due to high demand and no more production.   Its kind of a moot point when you're looking at it from a purely financial incentive.",Neutral
AMD,I guess I replied to the wrong person,Negative
AMD,For sure I feel you. I didn’t see that you had fixed it. This CPU should come with a guide or something so no one misses one of these important steps. I was surprised I had to seek the information out through other sources,Negative
AMD,"Sorry, 53 cores?  Regardless, it sounds more like you have a bad part rather than a situation where you need an upgrade.  If you have your bios up to date and set to Intel default limits, you can set P-cores to 8, E-cores to 0, and disable hyper-threading.  If your PC is still shutting off or crashing, it could be the cooler, the CPU (Intel 13th/14th gen failures, or even the SSD (because it's crashing to bios).

AMD,"The 13th and 14th of intel CPUs are known to have some issues, just update your bios and you'll be fine.",Neutral
AMD,"From what i understand the 9800x3d wins by having less latency between cores, hence why it performs better with a lower clock. Most games also don't utilize more than 8 cores, so the 9950x3d also doesn't typically have a way to take a lead and ever so slightly underperforms as the rest of them don't get usage in game even if you make sure all 3d are utilized    The difference is also small, though, and if you ever want to upgrade you'll have a wider market to sell too as a gamer won't think twice about a 9950x3d over a 9800x3d, and animators/researchers would also probably be happy with a older model.     I'm not going fo say I didn't have doubts or I think i know better than you, but why worry about an extra $200 with a GPU that you couldn't catch for less than 1.5k if it let's you handle everything the more competitive model can, then heavier more professional loads today with potential to help later if theres ever a bottleneck?",Neutral
AMD,"Its all good mate,  I totally agree with you, Its so retarded that you have to happen to know   That you need to use Xbox game mode, gamebar and  NOT change the power scheme off balanced at minimum,  At maximum you need to Update and Change multiple settings in bios,  Install the processors Gpu driver and also before the chipset driver as otherwise it will secretly not install 2 drivers without telling you,  And become a bug fixer when at somepoint the  gamebar will screw up by directly change registry settings or build a Bat file ...  And thats not even all the things I could list,  Its completely bonkers",Negative
AMD,"Because why should OP spend $200 more money for a CPU that will go under utilized, when the 9800X3D will suit his use case? Especially when he said 99% of the time the pc will be used for gaming...  You're going into this under the impression that PC hardware is somehow an investment... like a car, its a depreciating asset. It MIGHT hold more value, for a bit longer. But nobody buys hardware thinking how much money they are going to get back when they sell the hardware later. Or.... in the chance that MAYBE OP's use-case might change... which it would just be easier to upgrade to the latest and greatest at whatever time in the future that he needs something that suits his needs better.   Like I said elsewhere, that $200 can be spent elsewhere thats more meaningful... like going with a higher tier GPU, or more storage space. Or not spending it at all.",Neutral

AMD,"Depends on how much money you're willing to spend! In 2025, you'll see plenty of happy people still on their AM4 machines, with the two processors you named (5700/5800X3D) often at the heart of it.   I noticed for your use case that you find yourself not gaming as much as you are running a VM and coding. For that, you'll want to consider an 8 or 16 core processor like the [Ryzen 7 5700X](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09VCHQHZ6) for $169 or [Ryzen 9 5900XT](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0D6NMCZG1) for $284. The X3D chips cannot be bought new as of now as far as I can tell, but for your use case, you should be fine with the non-X3D chips.  You would probably need to update the BIOS of your motherboard to support 5000-series chips. Your 2700X has the same TDP as the 5900XT (105W), so you should be fine with either chip.  If you have more money to shell out, AMD has stated that they would support and release chips for the AM5 platform through 2027. A [Ryzen 7 9700X](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0D6NMDNNX) would run you around $300, plus you would need to get a new motherboard and RAM, which would cost probably around $450-500, depending on parts.",Positive
AMD,I just want to put this here. Assuming you get it for very cheap even a 3700x and above would give you extra performance if you cant get a 5xxx something.,Neutral
AMD,"Just upgrade to AM5 already. It still has at least two years of support, and for as long as you kept the last platform, that hardly matters anyways. When AM6 comes out it will be very expensive, as it always is, and it will be at least a few years for prices to normalize. You could be looking at another 5 years at least, before that makes sense, especially, again, since you already waited this long to even consider AM5. Even the absolute lowest end CPU you can get on AM5 beats the best thing on AM4 now, so you're just flushing money trying to hold out even longer.",Neutral
AMD,"This. I recently built one pc around a leftover 3070 and got a 5700x for it pretty cheap.   Then I got my hands on a cheap 3080 12gb and turned it into my living room gaming setup/console replacement with a 5800x. Especially when playing on a 4K tv, the cpu doesn’t really matter anyway. GPU will almost always be the bottleneck, except for the occasional strategy game I suppose.   But anyway for any 2000 ryzen, the 5700x/800x are huge upgrades.",Neutral
AMD,"Not sure what area OP is in, but in my area the 5700x and the 5800XT are basically the same price with the 5800XT being significantly better at gaming.  Honestly though I'm not sure it's worth ~$170 for a CPU that is already pretty dated. Maybe if OP gets a 5800XT and holds out for AM6 it'd be worth, but RAM prices are probably about to get even worse. Might be best to get ahead of that and nab one of the microcenter bundles (if he lives near one)",Neutral

AMD,Back your files onto a second drive or cloud storage and then do a full install from a USB   I've tried using the built in windows install twice and it failed both times and i ended up doing the reinstall via USB anyway,Neutral

You technically don't need to, but this is the most fail-proof way of preventing potential driver issues or critical errors after switching to a different CPU vendor and/or motherboard platform. By contrast, if you switch CPU's within the same vendor and platform, then a fresh OS install is totally unnecessary.",Neutral

AMD,"One thing you might want to do for the future is have one hard drive just for your OS, and other hard drives for everything else. This gets rid of the headache of stuff getting wonky with changes of hardware or OS problems. I've had all my games and files on their own drives for like 20+ years and just plug 'em in and good to go any time I reinstall windows or do computer upgrades, and then I can just wipe the main drive and reinstall windows without worrying about anything important disappearing.",Neutral
AMD,"I didn't even reset Windows for myself when I went from my Intel i5-12600K to an AMD 9800X3D. I just uninstalled all the programs and drivers named ""Intel"" that I could before the swap, such that the Windows default drivers kicked in, and then installed the requisite AMD stuff after the upgrade.  People will talk about ""instability"", but honestly it's overblown. The only real risk is typically that of leaving unused drivers that take up a marginal amount of space, i.e. if you left Intel chipset drivers but then put in an AMD chip (and installed its stuff), you'll have unused Intel chipset drivers taking up some MB.",Neutral
AMD,"**BACKUP FIRST**     I know you said you didn't have a spare drive but get one, you can use the money you would save by not going to BestBuy to do it like you said to buy a backup drive.     Now with that said, while most people are going to be recommending not to do this and to do a fresh install on the new system, and while that is indeed recommended, you will *probably* be fine if you just simply plug the drive into the new PC. The less additional hardware you have on initial boot the better (e.g. just the bare minimum needed for the PC to boot, no extra components, or even GPU if your CPU has a built-in one) and then put in the rest of the parts once it boots successfully. Windows is very likely going to just boot on the new hardware just fine, there is a chance there can be some instability, but it's likely going to work just fine. I have moved Windows drives back and fourth across systems just fine and they didn't give me problems.     The only thing I know for SURE will not work is if Windows was installed with your drive controller set to a different mode than the system you are moving it to (E.G. you installed Windows with a drive controller set to RAID and you move it to a non-raid system, or vice-versa.) 99.99% of people are not going to have their controller set to RAID, especially for an OS drive, and if they did they likely knew what they were doing anyway, so this is unlikely to apply but I figured I would mention it as a warning just in case. And even with that, if you still have access to the old system and it's old configuration or can temporarily change the drive controller on the new system to match you can get into Windows and change a registry key to make it recognize a new drive controller setting next boot.",Neutral

This has better ram, better mobo, better case, better psu and is primed for future upgradability. It is also cheaper while only losing minimal cpu performance.   There are definitely better mechanical keyboards at that price that are not only hotswappable but also n-key roll-over from keychron. I personally use the mkey tkl darkness and if you get the numpadless version it's 89 aud otherwise full kb is 99 aud. It has everything you expect in a more premium keyboard like n-key roll-over, hotswappable, top notch gateron gpro 2.0 switches of whatever colour you like, software for good level of customisability, good build quality, comfort and a dial knob to adjust settings.  https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/yT9mb2",Positive

Went with an ATX board that isn't Asrock, since noone seems to have solved why they have a larger than usual failure rate especially with 9000 series AM5.  Went with an air tower without RGB, but if you want to overkill it without breaking the bank, thermalright have 7 different 360 AIO for under $100 AUD and 40 different 360 AIO under $200 AUD.  Went with a larger capacity 4TB SSD with HMB just to show a price comparison.   If still need the 3.5 drives maybe consider upcycling your old PC into a NAS to keep the noise down in your regular system.  Went with a larger Airflow focused case with preinstalled 3x140mm and 2 x Reverse 120mm Fans, if you would like to stick with Antec any of their Flux series would also be suitable.  Keyboards are a matter of personal preference, but their is a gamut of fully built Keyboard's, Keyboard kit's, switches and keycaps to choose from. So do consider them all before settling for any old board.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks man. I actually got rid of the paste because looks like fans come with paste anyway. Also dropped the fan down to a Thermalright Assassin X 120 Refined because from doing a bit of reading, a double tower is overkill for a baby 9600X. Good catch on the mobo and PSU too.  That case only comes with the 1 fan, looking at a Montech AIR 903 or Fractal Design Epoch if I'm feeling fancy.",Positive
AMD,"Unfortunately I need the HDD for my data collection.  I thought the Asrock MBs only had problems with the 9800X3D, but if it's universal for all 9000 series I'll change it, thanks for the heads up on this.",Negative

AMD,"Looks like the 7500f is like 5% slower than the 9600X in a lot of games and only $68 cheaper, so just to be on the slightly safer and futureproof side I might stick with the 9600x. Do you recommend any aliexpress sellers for the 9600x?  I also dropped the Peerless Assassin to the Assassin Refined. Apparently a double tower cooler is overkill for a baby 65W CPU.  Any reason to go for the Eagle instead of a mATX? I was going to get the MSI B650M GAMING WIFI because it seems to be able to do everything I need.  Keyboard is a whole different thing I haven't even started looking at, thanks for the tips mane.",Neutral
AMD,> Unfortunately I need the HDD for my data collection.  Just a reminder to never trust your data to a single drive! Three in a nice RAIDZ1 layout with some cheap / free older hardware built out as a NAS is very reasonable and a good first step to data protection if you have some can't-lose data.,Neutral
AMD,"It's only the weird SKUs where you're gonna benefit from ali express, as I said subtract 110 from cpu because it is actually 190 AUD for the 7500f. I went with more expensive components so you won't have any problem upgrading to future zen 6/7 ryzen 7 x3d cpus which will have 12 cores. It has provides 3 m.2 slots, has better pcie expansion, way better VRMs for power delivery and has alot more usb ports and might have better wifi.",Neutral

AMD,"Massive mistake on AMD’s part here. It reminds me of how Apple supports many of its older iPhones with major iOS updates for around seven years, and Android makers followed suit. The difference here is that I would have expected Nvidia to make a move like this first, while AMD tried to gain market share - but instead AMD has practically shot itself in the foot. I bought an RX 6800 brand-new about four years ago, and now it’s been relegated to “maintenance mode” rather than being treated as a full-supported card. That’s ridiculous. Nvidia might very well be back on the cards for my next GPU.",Negative

Adding insult to injury I bought a laptop at 2023 with R3 5425u with vega graphics too, I barely have seen 2 driver updates from AMD for that (I use the amd drivers not the laptop maker ones).

Yes, there's some great value GPUs in there, especially on the used market but I strongly feel we need newer tech at better prices, not old tech at lower prices. We're realistically not gonna get that if AMD has to continue trying to squeeze out performance from their less successful desktop GPUs. AMD needs to focus on ML and ray tracing to catch up to Nvidia otherwise you're gonna get no driver support because there will be no AMD GPU division. Ray tracing on these cards is ass.

AMD,Got to be honest as 7900 XTX owner feels like as soon as AMD released the 9070 xt they abandoned us. Like 7900 XTX buyer were early adopters. Took AMD whole year to fix VR perf on 7900 XTX. AMD never gave clear answer on FSR4 support for 7900 XTX. My next gpu prob not going to be from AMD.,Negative

I was already looking at the 9070xt vs the 5080 and while I know they're not directly comparable as AMD has already lost a little bit of favour from me with them admitting they want to stay ""mid-range"" with their flagship, this driver choice is making think team green again as my current card feels like it could go for another year or two easily.",Negative

AMD,"Its not like they are supporting new games anyway some new games have random driver timeouts like cyberpunk 2077 or the last of us part 2 was not playable without random driver timeouts on release just got fixed, thanks AMD but should be on day 1.  Or Hell Divers 2 that had issues at launch, or Dying light 2 that had RGB laser show bug outside the Radeon boost issues the game had for 1 and half year or so more or less.  As well as some unity based games having random driver timeouts on least RDNA3 due those games not handling the high clock speeds that well on stock.  They may be dropping support, but they never properly supported these gpu's to begin with and now RDNA3 we just waiting for games to be playable, by the time it gets fixed it wont matter anymore, i could not play wow for example during the entire Dragonflight expansion and wasted 200+ euros on a game and subscription that i could not play for almost entire expansion, so i am happy i can finally play it again.  Hopefully i can as well during midnight expansion which has its first beta on 11 november now.  The attitude AMD often has oh its just hardware issue 99% of the time its a driver issue and their vanguard program users unable to reproduce issues, simply due lack of information required to fix these issues, because sometimes its not easy to reproduce however for those having issues, avoiding the issue is as simple as simply not playing the game with the issue, as much that sucks.  And there is the Radeon tax you pay you only get to play what the vanguard program users like to play, you want to play that latest game that AMD has not enough users playing well tough luck and sometimes its also because NVIDIA simply makes the game unavaible until launch so AMD can only fix it as soon as its released, so NVIDIA wins by default because AMD cannot support the game to begin with at launch.     So yeah that AMD is just straight out saying they putting RDNA1/2 in Maintenaince mode not supporting the latest games really pisses me off, but its not like they doing that right now anyway even RDNA4 suffers from issues with games at launch.  But i will compliment AMD for finally working with game devs these days they been doing that for over a year or 2 now and probably longer, but they have to figure out how to do things better, because this is not acceptable.  I could litterally spend time making memes out of these driver issues and actual proof that these issues are actually real driver issues, but i do not like a burnout or work for free, which is why i rejected joining the vanguard program few times in the past, alto i have cooperated with some users figuring things out even testing things, but AMD should honestly do this them self.  But i am still avaible to do so eitherway if i am able to do that, but as some one hat has no job AMD could really do something about it and start hiring people for these type of things, so they can actually fix things rather then ignore these issues.",Negative

AMD,"Yeah Vega (last competitive card in my line of work.) and Radeon Pro Renderer debacle is prob the reason why AMD GPU's are something I will never consider them as a 3d artist/animator.  (Pro renderer was pretty much forcing every 3d developer to learn their standard vs the industry standard for a 5-10% performance boost. When the Vega 64/1080 ti where pretty competitive in Blender Cycles at the time where it depended on the work load (lots of textures to load? Vega wins with it's memory. A lot of calculations the 1080 ti would edge out in render time. Pretty much 2 years after they just dropped support and in that time NVIDIA has secured such a lead that the 9070 XT is around the performance of a 3060 and 3060 ti in rendering. 7900xtx without zluda is around 4060 tier, and 7900xtx with zluda was slightly below 4060 ti.)",Negative
AMD,"You have to look at it from a profit standpoint. Only 10% of AMDs profit comes from the gaming sector. This includes profit from Xbox/Playstation business as well. Their desktop GPU share is in the single digits. There have been multiple years where this sector operated as a loss for their overall business. So honestly it really doesn’t matter how mad you get. Now that AI is starting to be a bigger part of overall profitability, your voice is getting smaller and smaller. Gaming is evolving into a service as it is. Hardware eventually won’t matter much. Only difference will probably end up being how you want to experience it. Like watching Netflix on your phone or a big screen. Everything will be a “gaming device”. Younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha are the tablet generation anyway. One of the reasons why the Switch and Switch 2 did so well. Your anger is about as effective as putting an angry note in a dusty comment box.",Neutral

AMD,"This approach is often referred to as **""cutting corners.""** You really can't compare AMD and Nvidia directly. If AMD truly wants to improve and be innovative, they kind of have to cut corners in some areas.  It certainly stinks for the people who own older GPUs, but I think most people won't notice a big difference. I had an RX 6950 XT myself and didn't update that card regularly. That doesn't mean other people didn't have problems, but speaking from my point of view, there isn't that big of an improvement from the Day 1 updates. At least, I didn't really notice it.  Ultimately, it's the developer's job to optimize a game. Everything on AMD's side that causes games to crash and not start will still be fixed. They'll just stop with the **Day 1 optimization** efforts.",Negative

AMD,"I am not an AMD fanboy, or have any allegiance but I am somewhat understanding of their decision.  Providing game optimization for 2+ year old, previous generation, GPU's requires a lot of work and expense.  AMD has to constantly be releasing new tech, at a ridiculous pace just to keep up.  Thus, cutting off support for ""old"" products is not unheard or, or unreasonable.  The RDNA 1 and 2 generations are nearly 5 years old.  While they did release new product within the last couple years, it was primarily for the Chinese market.  Furthermore, this announcement is likely being driven in part by game developers who are frustrated with the demand to release higher levels of game performance, and yet still capable of running on older GPU's.........Besides, is this the excuse we're all looking for to justify that next purchase?",Negative

AMD,"This is the real problem.  In a vacuum, maybe it's just a bad look and AMD could get away with it.  But trailing a distant 2nd in the market, supposedly trying to gain market share, AMD absolutely cannot burn customer goodwill like this.

AMD,lmfao I can’t believe people have been convinced that power cable issue is anything more than a tiny risk,Negative
AMD,"I'll bite.      Losing Day 1 driver support will mean poorly optimised at launch titles like Borderlands 4 will either run badly or potentially not at all when released, and opens the question as to when exactly they will be backported. While you can argue this isn't really AMD's (or nVidia) job to fix it helps develop a sense of existing customer support for medium age product (the oldest RDNA2 card is less than 5 years old, the newest less only 2) which can in turn cultivate sustained brand loyalty.   AMD was widely praised for using 16GB of VRAM in the 6000 series specifically because it would likely allow the cards to age well as VRAM became a larger consideration, by cutting driver support to maintenance mode they've now done they exact opposite.      The bigger issue is that this may hint that RDNA2 cards will not be receiving official FSR4 support, which would be a massive blow to customers with those cards because FSR4 is a significant improvement on previous iterations of the technology and we have proof, albeit unofficial, that RDNA2 cards can support FSR4 natively and gain significant benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,"Because people are fucking stupid, and act as if their cards suddenly just blew up. Reality is, AMD cards run games fine without day 1 drivers or anything. RX 580 of yours can even run software ray tracing games like Silent Hill f.",Negative
AMD,Agreed. This is more headline catching than actual impact on PC gamers. A lot of these cards are mid at best as he pointed out.,Negative
AMD,I would get occasional crashes in some games with my Vega 64. Otherwise not that big of a deal.  But why wouldn't you get a card with better long term driver and software support if you can? I was on a Vega 64 till two weeks ago but finally jumped ship to an Nvidia 5060ti 16gb for $400.,Neutral
AMD,"Funny CS grad taught me the opposite, don’t let one company corner the entire market.",Neutral
AMD,"If your GPU is few generations old you're more likely to fuck shit up by updating drivers than improve anything.  People who think that there are actually any optimalizations for old architectures besides checking the checkbox that driver is compatible with said GPU are delusional.

The Battlefield 6 compatible driver caused the Adrenaline to recognize the game as Elder Scrolls Online, fucking lol. Previously I was on 25.8.1 and it was fine.   That's literally the only change between 25.8.1 and 25.10.2 i've noticed and due to that Elder Scroll bullshit I actually regret updating. Should've stayed on old driver.

AMD,Nvidia supports stuff way longer. And their drivers are higher quality even now in their state they usually don't have texture or shader issues which need a day 1 fix.,Positive
AMD,> Just consider also that NVidia does exactly the same thing just silently.  Yeah I'm gonna need some receipts here chief.,Neutral
AMD,I’ve got mine undervolted and over clocked and it’s faster than a 9070 non xt.,Positive
AMD,"A card being cheaper is not an excuse for less driver support. NVIDIA, AMD and Intel should support their cards for at least 6 years. NVIDIA only dropped support for GTX 700/900/1000 series this month, which is actually quite impressive.  They are generally cheaper because they are generally slower. It is just the truth. DLSS (especially Transformer vs. CNN) is superior to FSR, NVIDIA GPUs are generally faster, greater software support, etc. AMDs only major benefit if I recall is greater memory capacity.  AMD and Intel to their credit generally crush NVIDIA with more generous memory capacity. Unless you buy a \*\*90 card, NVIDIA want your card to struggle within two-three generations (so 4-5 years).  I truly want to see a compelling AMD GPU that I want to buy immediately, but I haven't seen one since the RX 480 (and I already had a GTX 970), at least for my requirements. I usually already have an NVIDIA equivalent by the time AMD announce it a year or two later.",Positive
AMD,They aren't cheaper.,Negative
AMD,"Bit dramatic. There have been several games recently where NVIDIA didn't provide day one drivers for even **their latest** 5000-series graphics cards. On top of that, the 5000-series has been plagued by driver issues causing stuttering and black screen crashes for several months while the RX 9000-series has been rock solid.  They're still getting drivers. You may miss out on 0-5% performance on a game's launch (with emphasis on 0%), on 5 year old hardware. If this causes you to go NVIDIA, which has even more driver-related issues at the moment, you're ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,"Me too, already put my 7600 for sale to get a 4060 ti instead",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia hardly respects gamers either. They would throw us all under the bus to sell more AI chips to enterprise tomorrow if it was as simply as flicking a switch.  Currently the state of the GPU market if you want to at least try to do the right thing is picking the least worst option whoever that is for you. None of them are loyal to us.,Negative
AMD,"Some games need driver updates. I keep my drivers updated, so it's never an issue for me. But my partner doesn't do that, and had multiple issues last few years where a new game didn't work properly. And where ""did you remember to update the video driver"" was the fix.",Negative
AMD,well here the difference is more like 250-300€,Neutral
AMD,"Evil is still evil.   I just bought a 9070XT knowing what AMD did and I don't care, it's the best upgrade I could get for the amount I paid.  I paid 730$ for it, a 5070 Ti here costs around 900$ for the base models.   No way in hell is virtually same performance worth 160$ more. DLSS4 is tempting, but not for 160$.",Negative
AMD,I had a 1080ti before I upgraded to my 6900xt as well.,Neutral
AMD,"I lost count of games I have preordered, crashing due to documented AMD driver issues. FSR4 not available for RDNA3 made me sell my XTX and finally switch to Nvidia.  And I enjoyed my XTX, despite the insane heat and power draw required to match a 4080S in performance. While sucking at RT, No Upscaling, No Reflex, broken DSC implementation and the list goes on. Adrenaline would crash on startup on fresh windows installs for months, until they \*finally\* fixed it. Their overlay crashing Helldivers entirely, games not detected, settings not applying on reboot.  R9 270, RX 480, 6950 XT, 7900 XTX. Not even one of these cards did not not have issues. And not like Nivida, oh the grass won't display well in that one game. No, 23.10.1, 23.10.2 and even 23.11.1 broke Hardware Acceleration completely. Edge, Steam and Discord in foreground would freeze the entire PC for seconds.  And I kept it all clean, updated, Windows, BIOSes, you name it.

AMD,"You forgot the fact that they paper launched their cards up until the 5060 and had the gall to allow Asus to make a US$10000 solid gold 5090. Honestly if anyone were to flaunt that card in front of me they’d be in for a fucking black eye. I don’t even want the card, but the thought of it existing enrages me.  Also I have completely dumped windows for Linux now (mostly pertaining to how I cannot control windows update when it comes to drivers, it seems to ignore everything I throw at it short of a group policy, even now I can’t do that because Microsoft disabled my pro key over the petty reason that they no longer allow upgrades from windows 7, 8 and 10 to 11. Never mind that the key has been used to upgrade to 10 and later 11 before and therefore should remain valid. And guess what?

AMD,"I see more people moving to Linux distros like nobara and bazzite, with Microsofts force-feeding windows 11 shenanigans the past months.   Personally, the only thing I didn't get working yet is steamVR. Other than that I have no need for windows, at all.",Neutral
AMD,"Linux market share, according to Valve, is around 2.7%. Macs are about 1.8%.",Neutral
AMD,About to be in that % hence why I bought AMD cards recently for that exact reason. Will maintain copies of Windows for when needed.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes I saw that, it probably does means that they wont get game specific drivers but it doesn't *explicitly* say that. It says they will focus on RDNA 3 and 4, but that doesn't mean they wont get them at all, it just might be later. That's why I'm saying it might've been better to wait and get **clarification** before dropping a video that will rile people up without knowing for a certainty.",Neutral
AMD,Day 1 drivers are mostly marketing but they do occasionally fix bugs in the game that you will encounter without them.   It’s not a big deal though.,Neutral
AMD,"And still, RDNA 2 will still get updated driver but probably not as frequently.   I think that once UDNA/RDNA5 comes, people will mostly forget about RDNA2 regardless.",Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't matter. It is much easier, from now on.  Does a GPU have AI capabilities? Yes = full support, No = half support.   (I am talking about FP8 or better. Not just INT8)",Positive
AMD,That global decision is from now on.   AMD and Nvidia doing it basically at the same time.,Neutral
AMD,GTX900 1000 so call support are just bug fix,Negative
AMD,"Nvidia doesn't do this for their 3000 series, I think the 900s had 9 years of support or something like that",Neutral
AMD,Agreed. And they’re even worse.   I have a motherboard with an Nvidia chipset that can never work on windows 10. Installing win10 causes the board to try to install two separate GeForce drivers side by side until the registry becomes corrupted.,Negative
AMD,It's in maintaince mode. So no day 1 or day 1000 games optimisation. Please learn the meaning of maintaince. Only security and bug fix.   So stop spreading misinformation,Negative
AMD,No day one optimizations no new features. That's cutting support,Negative
AMD,"They didn't reverse anything, it was right in the release documentation.  HUB lied and made rage bait headlines for revenue.  This isn't the first time this has happened.",Negative
AMD,Not saying anyone is right or wrong here but when was the last time someone absolutely needed the game ready driver for a game to work at all.   Battlefield 6 just dropped and you can play it with almost any driver in the last 12 months and still get the expected performance based on benchmarks. The scope of dropping these optimizations for older cards doesn't seem as outrageous as it would be on Nvidia where games frequently have severe bugs or don't work without the Day One driver update (EX: Final Fantasy 16 on Nvidia).  I do forsee a problem though where if RDNA1 and 2 do not receive updates on a regular basis they might get gated out of launching a game with astonishingly lazy driver detection (like Warzone).,Neutral

Ryzen mobile 7840HX and 7940HX both released in January 2024, both also have RDNA2 based GPUs.  You should be judging these decisions based on the LAST product release in the generation, not the first.

AMD,"Check with OEM.....  Feels like a ""eat a bag of dicks"" comment from AMD lol. But yeah the vendor usually provides the drivers for handhelds, at least from my experience.   Presumably the OEM gets drivers from AMD and then customises for their devices so if AMD aren't going to do any updates we might as well get told to get fucked.   Advanced Marketing Disasters, lol.",Negative
AMD,"Yea no OEM is providing the level of support that AMD was themselves. As a follower of the PC handhelds since GPD's first launch in 2016, watching AMD move into this scene was like a drunk bull in a china shop.  OEMs do not want to write drivers for your hardware, they make little profit as is per machine, and long term support is not in their best interest. You will get a few drivers throughout the year if you are lucky, but their support is not going to be on the level of what AMD could provide. When the 780m came out from AMD, i was an early adopter in the form of the GPD Win Max 2 and many of the smaller OEMs had to battle AMD to start maintaining their drivers for their product as they did try and rug pull everyone with that ""OEM maintains drivers"" for a product none of them had architectural knowledge of. Over a few short months AMD took over maintaining them which was good, and its laughable their GPU side even considered releasing a product like that considering the demographics they were aiming for.",Negative
AMD,TF2 is almost 20 years old. It's hardly an apt comparison.,Negative
AMD,Why is everyone so hung up on TF2? Like name another game that isn't a subscription MMO or live-service/esport that had half as long of support. And it will still get vulnerability and compat updates like all their games get.,Negative
AMD,Valve's driver developers are still pushing improvements for first-gen GCN hardware. There is nothing to worry about when it comes to RDNA support in the open source drivers.,Positive

Just use whatever Linux Distro you go for as you would use Windows and then you'll slowly but surely find out what you need and possibly some alternatives for what you need",Positive
AMD,"Nope, we use a different driver stack that is open source through Mesa. Mesa actually is packaged for both AMD and Intel Arc. And we will maintain support for a looooong time. The AMDGPU driver supports every amd GPU to this day starting with I think the old 7000 series (like 7970).",Positive

AMD,$6000mxn here in Mexico.,Neutral
AMD,Depending on your area the price difference definitely affects the equation.  If a 9070xt is 700 euros and a 5070ti is 1000 euros then that's definitely a no brainer to go with the 9070xt.  Even if you only get 4-5 years of full driver support that's still a better deal.

Or let say if you play game as a service (fortnite, warzone, war thunder etc.) and let say two years down the line they have big overhaul to the engine, a game you played and enjoyed with no issue with your current GPU might not work well all of a sudden, even though it still has the capability to run the game well.",Neutral
AMD,"We do know, because the whole premise is nonsense. AMD doesn't have cashflow issues, they don't need to cut corners.

The cards will still be in ""Maintenance mode"".   This is AMD trying to save face. I have 3 AMD motherboards in my room, have never built an Intel system. My first GPU was the ATI 9700/9800 pro. Been an AMD fan boy my whole life. Software/drivers are the exact reason I switch to Nvidia many years ago. Still looks like they are fumbling this aspect of their GPU business.",Neutral

AMD,"It's more than that. Example: I have a Vega 56, so I am on the same maintenance driver branch as your RX580. I could not play the BF6 beta - the client flagged my GPU as having an old driver version. Now, I don't know if that changes for the retail release - BF6 system requirements list RDNA 1 GPUs as being compatible, but now they're only going to get maintenance releases and they won't be on the current driver branch either. My point though is that ""optimizations"" is understating what is happening for being able to play new games at all",Negative
AMD,"Theres a lot of problems. For one, if there's a game where it refuses to start on older drivers (which is more common than you think), it means you're effectively SOL on playing that game. This is especially bad on RDNA2 iGPUs like the 680m (and apparently even the 780m is affected by this which means new game support is going to be unoptimized as shit on Windows handhelds) which can be touchy at playing some of the newest games without the latest drivers.",Negative
AMD,"> so you're effectively losing a bit of performance in new games. what else?  Imagine you're buying a new GPU by observing the FPS benchmarks for *Game #1*. And then the sequel called *Game #2* comes out but your GPU performs weaker than it should, not because it lacks raw power but because AMD or Nvidia simply did not prep the driver to fully utilize your GPU.  If we're talking about an older card, I kind of get it. If we're talking about a 2-4 year old card like the RX6000 series, I think that's a huge blunder.",Negative

AMD,Do you have a ram issue?,Neutral
AMD,"Just to clarify, Linux drivers are a separate ecosystem from Windows. RDNA2 cards get feature updates and optimizations through AMDGPU/Radv/Mesa (although recently radv and mesa combined) independent of Windows ‘Game Ready’/maintenance mode. Even the Steam Deck will keep getting Vulkan/driver improvements. So ‘maintenance mode’ on Windows doesn’t mean Linux support is frozen, the open source stack evolves on a different schedule and often keeps older cards performant for years. i.e the HD 7000 (from 2012) series is still receiving game patches on linux.",Neutral
AMD,"Mine is actually crashing my pc on wake(just monitor shutting off). I even reverted to the previous driver and I am still having issues, multiple DDU as well. Absolutely no problems prior.

AMD,"Yeah, on my previous cpu (ryzen 5 3500x) I had like no fps in the first 5 minutes, but since I upgraded to ryzen 7 5700x, it takes no time to load the shaders and I can play with 300+ fps. Now after this driver update it's around 150, and doesn't improve, not even after 30 minutes. But I will check again later today.  To be honest I had a lot of issues with this gpu and I'm really fed up with it. Thinking about switching to nvidia.",Negative
AMD,Games are built with the generic APIs and hardware agnosticism in mind. A hardware vendor like AMD can always look at its driver to see if it can improve its interaction with the game to get additional performance out of it or if the game's implementation is conflicting somehow with the driver then see if it can be improved. In the vast majority of cases this doesn't result in big improvements but there have been cases in the past where driver patches greatly improved the performance or reliability of a game.,Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, I understand how you feel. I've been playing Overwatch since it came out and it worked flawlessly on Nvidia cards. With Radeon, there is always the pointless shader compilation every fucking time the game is launched and I don't know why it's the case because it absolutely does not happen on Nvidia. My 6700 XT works fine in most games but then there are issues in some games that are AMD only and I miss the days of using an Nvidia cards where I just did not have to think about the GPU at all.",Positive
AMD,day 1 optimizations,Neutral
AMD,"I'm not talking about the extensions, ""New Game Support"" is the problem.",Negative
AMD,"Sure, AMD funds part of the work, but Mesa and RADV aren’t AMD exclusive. Valve, Collabora, and others actively maintain cross architecture code, so RDNA2 still benefits from broader Vulkan and shader improvements. The open driver stack doesn’t stop evolving just because AMD moves on from Windows support.  Mesa and RADV are architecture agnostic in many areas. When new Vulkan extensions or optimizations land, they often improve all supported architectures (including RDNA2) unless there’s a hardware specific blocker. So even if AMD isn’t explicitly targeting RDNA2 you still get continued support and patches.",Neutral

AMD,Well i am for sure happy with my 9070xt. Does its work for less bucks than nvidia,Positive
AMD,"I don’t think they did? The correction is pointing out that it wasn’t changed and the patch notes were just incorrect.   Maybe it was something that was supposed to go out but got pulled cause someone was like, this is pointless it’s a tiny portion of cards and the code isn’t doing anything bad but never got removed from patch notes. Happens sometimes",Negative
AMD,"I can't explain in a more simplified way.  Nvidia started with AI GPUs earlier, thus more AI GPUs left to support.  AMD started late with AI GPUs, thus only RDNA 3 or better, to support.  It is a global decision made by both Nvidia and AMD. It just happened recently, they decided to do it in 2025.   Nvidia did it in July 2025, AMD did it now.",Neutral
AMD,"There isn't any more ""full support"" left to do. These cards are fully optimized and operating near theoretical performance peaks.  For 2027 games the difference between ""full support"" and ""maintenance support"" will be 0 FPS.  For 2029 AAA games, RDNA2 GPUs aren't going to be able to reach acceptable frame rates regardless of full support or not, because they lack the required hardware for the level of raytracing and upscaling that the games will have as minimum requirements.  Whether or not this was done this year, next year, or in 2027 is just optics, it doesn't chance anything.   There hasn't even been much optimization done in the last year anyway, so they've basically been in defacto maintenance mode.",Negative
AMD,"I'll play devil's advocate for a bit.  Nvidia is 13x bigger than AMD, and is almost exclusively focused on GPUs. Yes they do some CPU work (it's mostly ARM chips) and some networking (high GBe NICs), but their core is exclusively compute.  Meanwhile AMD is so much smaller, and their money is split between CPU and GPU divisions; with the CPU side being much healthier financially.  Not defending AMD's move here, but it's a miracle they're even competing at all - anywhere - with Nvidia, given the orders of magnitude less resources they have.   It *LITTERALLY* is David vs Goliath in terms of resources available to get shit done. Hope this at least puts things into context.   TL;DR: Which is why I don't think comparing to Nvidia is fair.",Neutral
AMD,"Does nvidia specify which gpu are not on there priority list? The problem is AMD announced they are just not putting RDNA 1 AND 2 on there 1 day support anymore but they are still supporting the drivers, Did nvidia do that?  Nope it's a problem with AMD release note that broke it that way.",Negative
AMD,"No. FP4 support is for 5000 series only. They could say that they're not supporting 4000 series anymore for new features.  Well, no, they just aren't phrasing it that way because it would drive away customers.  Meanwhile, AMD casually drops that shit.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, you are not the only one mentioned it, I will edit it.  What I actually meant is specific hardware = Tensor Cores = AI accelerators in general.   Point still stands, hardware is what matters for this decision, not the year of which a GPU was released.",Neutral

AMD,Basically zero issues on RNDA3 here so...,Neutral
AMD,"is it? If the drivers are good, games work, performance is good, is truly such a travesty?",Negative
AMD,"C'mon, it's mostly 4-6.25 year old GPUs.  Only a handful of 3 year old ones, which would have the same level of high optimizations anyway.  There just isn't much more work to do here, there is basically zero value for game-specific optimization at this point. And if there is a significant issue, we will see a patch for it for at least the next 2 years.  The industry is undergoing a technology transition and RDNA2 is going to be left in the dust for next-gen games, but Nvidia's 20XX series was farther along on the required hardware.",Negative
AMD,"Lmao no one on this subreddit will accept this even though it's been a thing since the dawn of time.   They both have had their issues. But many people, myself included seems to notice it A LOT more with AMD. I never had an issue on NVIDIAS 900,1000 series cards. As soon as I went to AMD for the 7000. Problems. Black myth was fucked for a week for me. Literally unplayable after a driver update that took a week to get fixed. TLOU2 performance was awful at launch and that took awhile to get fixed. DL2 took a month for like this weird flashing all over the place. DL the beast still crashes randomly.   I mean the only problems I ever had on team green was related to $$$.",Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA drivers have certainly been pretty sub-par this year. I now and again get a black screen on one monitor (I believe it is related to a VRR bug) in a certain game, only for it to instantly turn back on.   Toggling HDR in Windows sometimes makes both monitors go black, only fix is a reboot.   And I'm on 40 series, and it didn't become an issue until the 50 series launched lol.",Negative
AMD,"2025 release Ryzen Z2A = 0yrs driver support  The GTX 750ti is running October 2025 game ready drivers 11yrs later. At worst, the GTX 1080ti only gets 9yrs + 3yrs security updates.

Very few games that stand out in comparison to the previous genration, no wow factor at all.  Kinda feels the same going from GCN to RDNA. Sure it is better, but it hasn’t enabled for new gameplay concepts that would not be possible on GCN.",Negative
AMD,"When new games come out, optimizations to drivers are often needed. Sure the card has “full support” for all released games. But new games will be a pain. It’s not uncommon to see 25%+ increases in performance when drivers are optimized for a new game. So no, 2027 games will not see a zero fps difference. Also rdna2 isn’t that old or unsupported. It’s RT capabilities aren’t that much worse than the 7000s and rdna 2&3 both use fsr3. 7000 series is better at matrix multiplication but the 6000 series isn’t bad. The 6900xt has 40 tflops of fp16 performance which is as much as modern nvidia cards. Overall the 6000 series is comparable to the rtx 2000 series which is supported.  Rdna1 had to go.

AMD,"To counter though whether they want to or not they have to compete with what’s in the market. The issue is investment into the team.   Profits arent good? Why? It’s because they aren’t competing well against nvidia? Ok let’s make another product to compete and add more resources.   They shouldn’t be letting the team be that small due to profit margins. That would lead to a bad cycle of releases lacking support.  I will say the 9070 xt is awesome though and I have one, but the driver support definitely has room for improvement even on their newest card. If they want to stay in the market they need to grow not stagnate with same size team and stop showing to investors every 5 seconds, but that is wishful thinking for any company perhaps doh.",Negative

I wouldn't buy an AMD GPU as it stands because of many reasons, but this driver support stuff sure as hell convinces me I won't.",Neutral
AMD,"That’s true, I wasn’t trying to nitpick (although I admit I can be bad about it)   No doubt ai hardware is necessary and seems to be the dividing line. The 7000 series is cracked at fp16 performance and can do int8, honestly its WMMA hardware is grossly underused imo. While this is a gross simplification, the 6900xt, 7600xt, and rtx 5080 all have 40 tflops of fp16 performance. It really sucks rdna3 can’t do fp8 calculations. Considering rdna3 is the most powerful gen regarding fp16 performance, I’m hoping fsr4 is brute forced. I know there’s projects but I’m hoping for something official. I have a 4090 and 7900xtx, which I want to give more love.

AMD,"Just because it's a Game Ready Driver, doesn't mean that GPU is receiving a single line of code for any games.  Those cards have likely not received any significant optimization for like 7 years and probably zero optimization for 5 years and are likely just checked for bugs and security on modern OSes, aka ""Maintenance Mode"".  The only reason they're finally being deprecated now is that they won't be able to run the next waves of games because that will require tensor cores or equivalent.",Negative
AMD,"GTX 750TI longer support, because it is based on Maxwell(GTX 900 series).  And for example GTX 16 is a Turing based GPU just like RTX 20 but lacks Tensor cores(hence the naming GTX vs RTX), it falls right in between and was lucky to stay the course thanks to RTX20, sooner or later Turing full support will be dropped too(I bet GTX 16 will be sooner).  Nvidia announced in July 2025 that they will drop Maxwell and Pascal after October 2025.",Neutral

The main concern here is how CPU intensive it might be while paired with an equally old CPU.  https://youtu.be/wF0bG3LmGRA  .....  BL4 barely runs on an RTX 3060 12GB at 1080p.

Yes, the older, ""pre-RTX"" cards is what they are dropping support for, specifically the Pascal (2016) and Maxwell (2014) range. It has nothing to do with FP8 format support.

AMD,Right but my point is also they should add more resources to the team which in theory could be utilized for driver support and try to work more with RDNA 2 vs tossing it to a separate release branch and also resources for better GPU support with new stuff as well. So fix the driver support team in general is what I mean.   Whether they like it or not this act looks bad compared to the competition. So we can’t be too fair to them with team size vs Nvidia. AMD should fix that problem not stick with it and just have a smaller team.,Neutral
AMD,You're getting bugfixes and support for new vulkan+dx12 extensions though.,Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but how many people are realistically affected by that to begin with? It's not like iGPUs are typically used for much more than simple tasks like displaying the desktop or web browsing. dGPUs or Strix Halo level APUs are a completely different ball game.",Negative
AMD,"Laptop iGPUs get used for a ton of gaming (usually on potato settings or old/indie games, but engine devs still want to be able to rip out old code paths and be able to rely on modern features since eg. modern vulkan is now much simpler than vulkan 1.0 was, while also having new faster ways to do things).  Desktops and browsers are also moving to Vulkan+DX12 (Gnome's vulkan compositor, chrome and firefox are both shipping vulkan+dx12 backends and requiring them for full webgpu support, etc).  The issue is also when hardware support is ended early like this, then it pushes back the time when developers can start requiring new features to run software, and alternative code paths for hardware that lacks whatever required feature support aren't free to develop or maintain (and in some cases mean you essentially have 2 separate renderers, eg. bindless vs traditional/non-bindless).  This is one of the main reasons software developers are pissed about Intel getting rid of AVX512, because it pushes back the time when devs can start requiring it by ~5 years (meaning they now still have to wait 10+ years they until they can start making it mandatory, instead of in 5-6 years if Intel kept AVX512 support).",Neutral

AMD,"I discovered the cause of a bug that has been plaguing me for years, I thought it was an issue with Windows, but I just recently did a fresh install and discovered it is actually because of ReLive.     The problem is that if you are recording, or have the Instant Replay  feature turned on, when you change the volume and that Windows volume slider appears, it makes the game drop fps/stutter  severely.     Here is a video showing it, look at the fps numbers and graph next to it: [https://streamable.com/ui0vqj](https://streamable.com/ui0vqj)  Relive disabled (sorry for the recording quality, had to do it with my phone): [https://streamable.com/4a7e0h](https://streamable.com/4a7e0h)  There are some games where there is not a fps drop, but it shows some erratic behavior. For instance, on Little Nightmares 2 Enhanced Edition, it causes the game to ignore vsync/refresh rate of the monitor. I have my monitor set to 120hz, and here is what happens on LN2:  [https://streamable.com/jv4f5p](https://streamable.com/jv4f5p)  I also tested with 2 other recording software, Windows Game DVR and Steam Recording, and the issue doesn't happen with those: [https://streamable.com/rsesak](https://streamable.com/rsesak)     u/AMD_Vik Can you please look into to this?

AMD,Sad that they disabled PD on the USB-C port to make it happen though.,Negative
AMD,"I sadly don't have one to check, but my phone still quick charges with the new driver so.... maybe? Maybe not.   Maybe it means some version of USB-PD being disabled?",Negative
AMD,Was there ever any news about USB-C power not working properly or causing issues? Would have been nice if AMD explained why USB-C charging was removed and why such an old driver would be recommended.,Negative

AMD,"Thanks for the heads up. I'm wondering, would it be possible for you to capture this stutter in a GPU trace using something like [UI for ETW](https://github.com/randomascii/UIforETW)?  I have a rough guide outlined in a [much earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/11bhohu/refresh_rate_mismatch_in_232x/ja7t7h1/)  If you can capture a trace, compress to .zip, and fire it over to me via https://send.vis.ee or a method of your choosing, we'll be able to investigate; as far as I'm aware, ReLive shouldn't be causing any issues with overlays like that.  Reach out if you need a hand with anything,  Cheers",Neutral
AMD,"There are some old bugs that have been swept under the rug, such as the gradual performance degradation in F.E.A.R. — you can't revisit the classics.",Negative
AMD,I have the 7900xtx and have the same issue.  The game runs horribly on the new driver.  How do I do what you suggested?,Negative
AMD,"This also happens on other games, any full screen mode sends my 9070xt into 1600mhz core clock, so i get 50% the expected fps. Grear driver",Negative
AMD,Something like that happened to me in Escape from duckov.  The game played fine then I installed the new drivers and now I got like 15-20 fps and im on a 7900xtx.,Negative

AMD,"it's fixed , need to redownload",Neutral
AMD,Can you explain what you mean by hardware acceleration is broken?,Negative
AMD,"Yes, I have the same situation. BF 6 crashes without an error. When I try to launch COD Bo6, it gives me an error and doesn't start. My hardware is a 7800x3d and a 7900 gre. I've tried everything, but I had to roll back to 25.10.1, where everything is stable and working.",Negative

AMD,Same and i am trying to find stable driver -rx5700xt,Neutral
AMD,That'd be unfortunate considering that the 6000 series is only a few years old.,Negative
AMD,it would go down as the shortest lived GPU in recent memories if so,Negative
AMD,It looks like most of the extensions and their descriptions seem to either support FSR4 (exclusive to rx 9000 and soon to be rx 7000) for Linux or support  Dense Geometry Format (exclusive to future GPUs and possibly rx 9000 series) for Linux. So it makes sense that rx 6000 and earlier doesn’t have this support.,Neutral
AMD,they probably just don't have the hardware required for some of those extensions (av1 seems to be one of them that isn't available pre 7000),Negative
AMD,No. Just AMD messing around with the drivers.,Negative
AMD,"Eventually, yes",Neutral
AMD,Does this break the psvr2 support through the port? I was using that for it and it was perfect :O,Positive
AMD,"Nothing really, maybe some stability or crash fixes. Sometimes, it could mean better perf.",Negative
AMD,"Sometimes bug fixes and performance increases, usually nothing. A game doesn't need to be supported by a driver version to work.",Neutral
AMD,For example on 25.9.1 driver I wasn't able to use FSR4 on Battlefield 6. For some reason... Less crashes and probably better performance are other perks,Neutral
AMD,Doesn’t mean anything. It’s just marketing. At this point Intel drivers are better than both Nvidia and AMD. They have to try since they’re the underdog.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, yes, yes! Are we going back to the days of problematic drivers?",Negative
AMD,"Ah so that’s why I see them on Steam and Spotify. I think I haven’t seen them on Firefox yet, I thought my GPU was in the beginning stage of failing.",Neutral
AMD,"Clean install with drivers only fixes all of the problems I was having, sucks that I cannot use adrenaline software but everything runs much much smoother without it now.",Negative
AMD,I also have this issue but it only happens sometimes in YT. Such a weird issue.,Negative
AMD,"Every time I ever saw pixel corruption like that it was because of RAM instability. And unfortunately RAM is fickle and hardware vendors take shortcuts.  It's not uncommon for RAM to be perfectly stable at X voltage and Y temperate, and very unstable just a little bit outside of that. It's not uncommon for MB makers to supply more voltage than they claim, because it generally helps with stability which reduces the cost of their returns and warranties. And it's not uncommon for instability to appear in only one specific place when your intuition tells you it should show up elsewhere too.  So my advice is test your RAM in cold and warm scenarios. And try reducing the voltage.",Negative
AMD,Try disabling Hardware Acceleration,Neutral

AMD,good luck gaming on linux,Positive
AMD,for me the exact opposite... 25.9.1 was way better than 25.10.2 or .1 (i tried both) in terms of performance and smoothness especially. It's like i am playing without FSR (it can't be activated anymore.. GOOD JOB AMD!) and still with 130-150fps (with FSR it's like 180-220fps) it feels like low fps  and low hz (60hz?)

AMD,"I did run to it, was updating my nieces RX 6400 and was like wtf when I got the error. DDU didn't help so I tried the auto detect and it pushes me to the pro drivers so some reason. I simply assume it was some conflict do to running Win11 on an ""unsupported"" system so I ended up rolling back to 25.9.1 which installed issue free.  Good to know its just AMD having a Microsoft windows update moment but lucky I have to need to go back and update her drivers again.

AMD,"I'm so sorry to have to do this here, but Reddit has destroyed the old chat system so I can't message you anymore.  I've run into a really strange issue that's quite concerning. When using Relive, if I launch a game and record any gameplay using Relive, Adrenalin of course creates a folder for that game in the designated folder. For Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), it seemed to create a folder that has permissions issues, to put it lightly. I cannot delete the folder and I cannot play any media that's been recorded to it. If I copy or cut the media out into another folder, it plays fine.  Just recently the drive I have been using for Relive media has had issues, so I created a new folder for it on a seperate, newer NVME drive. I put the earlier issues down to just the drive failing and that Adrenalin wasn't at fault at all. I uninstalled Adrenalin, used DDU and did a completely fresh install. Only now, can you guess what has happened? Yep, the exact same thing. Media recorded in the Adrenalin-created Battlefront II folder does not play until cut or copied out of it, and despite my setting user permissions on the main base folder itself, I can't delete the damn thing. Last night it said I didn't have permission. Today, just trying now before writing this message, Windows is telling me the folder doesn't exist.  I'm worried about why this is happening yet again, on a seperate drive on a fresh install. It's only in Battlefront II that it happens, but for it to repeatedly happen across different hardware is absolutely something to notice.  Do you have any idea?",Negative

AMD,Hopefully it fixes bf6 crashing that's a big issue rn,Negative
AMD,Unless you use specific DX12/Vulkan extension that is introduced by particular driver version ;),Neutral
AMD,Intel drivers are by no means better. They seem to be since they add performance in more titles (compared to Nvidia/AMD) but that's more due to them being terrible at first and Intel working to fix those issues.,Negative

AMD,"I upgraded the driver a few times this year (been on 25.# branch a lot) and I haven't had any issues with stability at all and I keep my computer on all the time, and play a variety of games, including VR games.  If you're just having general instability in all games, I would make sure your memory or CPU are stable, like try a memory/cpu stress test. I recommend running like prime95 stress test for at least an hour and it should come back with zero errors. If it comes back with any errors, that means any video driver issues you had, could have been caused by CPU/memory problems.  (Correction: I had one strange issue with Minecraft (Java) and Complementary Reimagined 5.5.1 shader, where \~5% of the time when I used a bed to sleep, I would get a driver timeout, but I assumed it was a bad combination of mods and the shader I was using. It was so strange... only when I went to sleep, never any time else.)",Positive
AMD,Bean soup theory much?  I know what I'm lookig at and on my 4k OLED tv it's not it. Feel free to game however you like,Negative

AMD,"Is that similar to the Polaris/Vega drivers, which are updated very infrequently and do not receive new features?",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe it's just due to the AI hardware? RDNA2 has no AI features, so maybe they just don't bundle the AI NPU Driver?",Negative
AMD,Best case: FSR 4 int8 is coming soon and they want to only provide the necessary version for everybody.,Positive

AMD,Only if you experience issues that could be caused by old driver remains,Negative
AMD,"No, thats not *usually* necessary",Negative
AMD,I don’t think it did. Since apparently it was an older build of the game. I was playing at 4k and I’m pretty sure it was fsr 3 even though it said fsr 4 was on.

AMD,"There are a lot of quirks present in drivers to make stuff performant.  The devs might be choosing a really poor rendering path for AMD for example and no workaround can boost performance.  If you're CPU bound in DX11, use DXVK or DXVK GPLAsync.  If it's an UE 4/5 game, run in DX12 instead of DX11 and you'll be less CPU bound once again.

AMD,"are you making use of the recommended mods like large address aware? The last time I played through, I remember having to also use a reworked directInput module as the game would respond horribly to mouse input otherwise.  Looking at it now, EchoPatch seems like a recent development (or at least one only recently recommended), though seems to offer a comprehensive solution across many problem areas experienced when running on contemporary operating systems.  E: One other thing comes to mind, are you running this from Steam or GOG? I've only ever ran this through Steam (requiring the above mods). Looks like F.E.A.R. Platinum is in the GOG Preservation Program (thinking i should pick this edition up anyway).",Neutral
AMD,"He's not doubting that it occurs but there's known problems with FPS drops over time on modern systems that happens that happens regardless of vender so a driver can't fix it.

Oh and don't post screenshots as gif, it's disgusting (waste of bandwidth and hurts the eyes)...",Negative
AMD,"They aren't ending support, but you should expect some features not arriving to RDNA 1 and RDNA 2. (I wouldn't expect RDNA 2 to have FSR 4 officially)",Neutral

AMD,"That's neat, I'll need to pick up that GoG version to check in with. I've only ever used the Steam version on win10 and 11.

AMD,The USB-C port is the reason I bought a reference 7900 XT! I have a mini-ITX case with a handle and the USB-C port lets me do a quick one cable + power connection on any of my home desks or televisions. I now need to check if any of my unpowered hubs still work.,Positive
AMD,Killing support for rdna2 this quick is criminal while nvidia is still supporting rtx 2000 series which is rdna1 counterpart... I am glad I got my 6800xt for barely 300$ from a gpu mining farm instead of buying at full price. Can't even imagine how I would feel,Negative
AMD,My 6950 doesn't feel old enough to be pushed out already.  Makes me seriously consider getting nvidia for my replacement with this type of crap.,Negative
AMD,"the USB part is so baffling when you realize that the PSVR2 has an advantage on the reference cards due to requiring only one cable.   and WORSE still. its a catch 20/20 situation, this driver fixes a grave VR issue present for almost a year. but at the same time kills VirtualLink support.",Negative

AMD,"This is some bs, they need to reverse this decision, AMD is getting a little too greedy, pulling stunts even nVidia haven't done yet,.

AMD,"Jesus christ.   GPUs like the 6800 XT are only 5 years old & being considered 'Legacy' & so thus getting degraded drivers. Meanwhile Turing GPUs from 2018 are still getting frequent full driver support (and so is the 11 year old GTX 980 for the time being). People wonder why people go for Nvidia for GPUs, but things like the official driver support are a very good reason why people go Nvidia, as they give frequent GPU drivers for older GPU series whilst AMD starts to kill them off after 5-6 years.",Negative
AMD,It's sad that amd often kills support or degrades the support faster than nvidia  I plan to upgrade my gpu soon ( my cpu upgrade is a 7800x3d already here ) but I will absolutely look more on the nvidia side.  6000 series isn't old yet and them already putting it on some weird 2nd branch isn't looking great.  I'd rather pay 50 or 100 more and don't have a badly supported gpu in a few years.,Negative

I would've begrudgingly accepted it had they done this in 2027-28. Wouldn't have been happy, but could've lived with it.

AMD,I'll buy green from now on. Have a 6800xt so I guess F me even though it's still pretty fast.,Neutral
AMD,This has been my biggest reservation about buying AMD based graphics cards. Historically they have been pretty quick about reducing or ending driver support. nVidia tends to support their cards for a ridiculously long time. My 8800GT and 980ti felt like they got drivers forever.,Negative
AMD,"This is one reason I stopped using AMD GPU's, after they dropped support for my HD 6950 only 5 years after release. I see they're doing it again with RNDA2. And now I'd say it's worse since GPU advancements are a lot slower, and a 5 years old GPU is more than capable to play new releases.",Negative

AMD,It’s a little ridiculous considering the 6800 XT is faster than most 4000 series cards like the 4070 but let’s put it  out to pasture. Still plenty of power.,Neutral
AMD,"Part of it is that, while weaker, Turing has most of the hardware features of the 30, 40, and 50 series cards. RDNA4 is the first AMD generation to be more or less on feature parity with Turing. AMD dragging their feet for so long on ML and RT acceleration is going to make RDNA 1-3 age rather poorly in terms of feature backporting.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a 980ti.    What driver support is that card actually for real getting, other than being ""included"" in the driver package? No bug fixes, no additional performance improvements or game support.    Frankly I don't understand why AMD doesn't just let their driver packages get big. It avoids silly self owns like this.    A 1gb download nowadays isn't really that big of a deal for plenty of people.",Negative

AMD,"And it seems AMD removed option to use modded FSR4 in RDN2 in this latest driver.

Now we are not going to get jack shit officially.",Negative
AMD,"We should not ""understand"" the lack of FSR4 on RDNA2 cards though lol.  That was a clown move as well by AMD, and this new shit is just icing on the cake.  I was planning to buy 9070XT for my girlfriend, but hello to 5070Ti now, absolute donkeys.",Negative
AMD,"This is the same driver where they apparently fixed the framerate instability in VR. Maybe the problem only came up when was using USB PD and USB data on the same port?  So they just disabled the user from being able to do that.  That'd still be dumb though. Plus, a lot of ITX builds use that port to hook up portable monitors.",Negative
AMD,"I’m not sure either, unless it was causing some sort of stability issue I truly can’t understand why you’d disable such a random feature.",Negative
AMD,Did you notice that AMD fixed the refresh rate bug in the patch notes. Haven't tested my Index yet but it was finally marked as fixed. I've been stuck on 24.12.1 until now.,Neutral
AMD,"The thing is this was an advertised feature they took away, and just doesn’t make sense. There are work arounds but that just shouldn’t be necessary.",Negative
AMD,"It’s much more than a basic hub. It actually deals with the DisplayPort signals across the USB-C ports, whereas most hubs only use their single USB-C port for power passthrough.  In this particular case it means you could plug in up to a 20W USB-C display.  I actually use it as a ""docking station"", hooked up to an HDMI adapter and one of those ""branded"" USB-C adapter (3 USB-3 ports, a card reader, and I think a second HDMI port). Works just fine on my Macbook, iPad, Steam Deck, pretty much everything but my Switch because Nintendo's gonna Nintendo.",Positive
AMD,Linux users,Neutral
AMD,I've been using AMD cards across several VR headsets and never had a problem 🤷‍♀️,Positive
AMD,BMW attempted something similar if you weren’t aware. They were trying to lock heated seats among other features on a subscription based model. Last I heard they rolled it back due to customer backlash.,Neutral
AMD,"The ""fine wine"" reputation was more of a meme than anything else. Realistically, you do not want your chips to undergo a ""fine wine"" process in the first place.

AMD,Because it is already running and tested,Neutral
AMD,"Nope. Linux uses their own AMD drivers, which are fully open and community maintained. Just works without you having to do *anything* and tends to perform better than the AMD Windows drivers... Or the old AMD-made linux drivers that AMD dropped support for because the Open ones were better in every way.  You do have a couple tradeoffs though... You don't get support for new things quite as immediately, and if you're on a slower moving distro, you might not get it for a while. Stuff like FSR 4 took a couple extra months to work on Linux, for instance. Also, because the HDMI forum is... Well, I don't have nice things to say about them, but they blocked HDMI 2.1 from working on Linux, so on linux AMD card HDMI ports are limited to HDMI 2.0 and don't get VRR support among other things, and AMD is legally not allowed to do anything to fix that.",Neutral

AMD,"nope, its a full branch",Neutral
AMD,And who quantifies that the poster is using an intel / Nvidia setup so he doesn't even have first hand experience running a RDNA 2 GPU.  AMD just split the driver branch there is zero official mention from them about RDNA 1 and 2 going into legacy status.,Negative
AMD,Samsung kills tablets in 8 months though,Negative
AMD,The problem there is essentially Apple did it for years already so everyone knows their word is good. Samsung only recently changed their policies so word hasn’t spread. Google benefits from being early to the long support time party among android manufacturers.,Neutral
AMD,"yet all userland jailbreaks/exploits still work on 15.8.5, Safari is outdated too.",Negative
AMD,"iOS have tied system apps to system, which mean even small bugs in apps like phone dialer can be system breaking and they need full system update to be fixed. On Android there its much less likely for system app bug to cause such big system wide problem and if such bug exist simple app update is enough to get it fixed.",Negative
AMD,What confuses me is why they recommend a driver from March if a user needs the feature?  The driver size is now 1.5gb?! It ballooned in size. 25.9.2 is less than 900mb.,Negative

AMD,"Yeah reality is ""bullcrap"" because some people don't want to believe in it.  Nice way of looking at the world.",Negative
AMD,"Agreed, but it's not just that. I'm not paying over 1k every two years or so because AMD decide to EOL my fucking card.   On the other hand, they can't even guarantee a set of drivers every month for their latest hardware.",Negative
AMD,"Majority of wine isn't suitable for aging, so yeah, I think it fits the description perfectly, heh.",Neutral
AMD,You’re talking about GPUs that’re literally 15 years old. Go a couple generations ahead to Tahiti and Hawaii and you’ll find that AMD did *much* more for those products than Nvidia has ever did for Kepler.,Neutral
AMD,It's 2 generations behind. It doesn't matter if the performance is still good for the current workloads.,Negative
AMD,Rdna 2 don't have AI core and it run very slow with the int8 model,Negative
AMD,"If i were to hazard a guess, one of the CVEs is probably to do with secure comms or usb standards and amd probably thought it easier to take off the feature rather than get it working under a cve. Another hazarding guess, it probably doesn't follow a standard they said they are, they got caught, and just got rid of it rather than address it.",Negative
AMD,It does make sense. AMD doesn't want you to use their cards for too long. They want you to upgrade every gen.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh, I see. You need that connectivity for the psvr2 to function, so a cheap usbc hub might not do, though passing usbc through a switch and converting to hdmi and so on are quite different things. While usbc to hdmi adaptors are really cheap to get a proper expansion hub is very expensive. I don't have psvr2 but it's not clear to me that that's what required if it's just to add power to the usbc port.",Neutral
AMD,at that point why not just buy the adapter for $60?,Neutral
AMD,"No, that’s different. If I fully disclosed that I’ve locked a physical function behind a payment and someone still buys the product then they’re the idiot. That’d be like if AMD charged $50 to access the USB-C functionality in the first place, but this is the equivalent of BMW offering the heated seats initially and then stripping them via software later (effectively having sold a product with a function and then removed it after the sale).",Negative
AMD,"Also fair, yeah. Nonetheless, I would take “fine wine” over whatever this new shift from AMD is though.",Neutral
AMD,"Its true that what fine wine really meant was that the drivers where not good enough to squeeze out all the performance of the hardware at launch.  But in practice, If I bough a card based on the price/performance ratio at launch, I'm still happy too see it improve over time.",Neutral
AMD,Silly like dropping support for GPUs released under half a decade ago…I could see it at this point.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, “AMD ages like fine wine” has honestly been more true on Linux than windows for a fair amount of time - but that’s just the nature of FOSS when actually talented, passionate people work on it.",Positive
AMD,"Same, got it in 2023 I think. And they're still selling them at 300 euros, absolutely absurd.",Negative
AMD,INT8 version 'leaked' and can be run on older AMD cards while providing much better visual fidelity with very little performance drop compared to FSR 3.,Positive
AMD,Now that's interesting. I wonder how it's emulating that. Is it getting converted to FP16 or BF16 and then doing the maths in that precision?,Neutral
AMD,typically when you split the driver branch its because you're putting one of them into maitenance,Neutral
AMD,I mean we know that android phones could run the newest android versions even with like 7-9 yo phones (rip custom roms 😭),Neutral
AMD,Very much the opposite. Apple used to degrade performance deliberately on only slightly older phones. Get sued for it.,Negative
AMD,The RDNA 3/4 version of the driver is 900mb.  The combined version with RDNA 1 and 2 support is the 1.5GB one.,Neutral
AMD,Adrenalin 25.10.2 (WHQL Recommended) is 902 MB.  Nvidia 581.57 is 896 MB.  These are very normal sizes for how many features they've added in recent years and how many thousands of games they support with custom code. They're really not growing that fast considering how fast flash storage has gotten cheap. It's like 50 MB/year or something?,Neutral
AMD,The main driver download includes both branches and their separate installers.,Neutral
AMD,"Pardon my ignorance,   Does the driver just run on the CPU?  Or does some of it also run on the GPU?",Neutral
AMD,iam honestly checking for a 5070 or smth now instead of a 9070,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah good luck most people won't buy AMD regardless for a good reason   My 6750XT has been filled with issues, my RX 550 died 2 years in",Negative
AMD,Companies 1000x smaller can still support products longer.  Yes. It is bullcrap and not reality.,Negative
AMD,"This is what the AMD Stans can't seem to understand. As someone who's used both Radeon and GeForce stuff, I can tell you... NVIDIA even when they remove support, they just get it right from the beginning. With GeForce you get 99% of the performance day 1. Rather than waiting months for the full performance of my card, NVIDIA gives it basically right away.  The whole FineWine argument makes no sense to me, these cards have a limited shelf life, if the first 6 months you're getting gimped performance, how is that a good thing? These cards are only relevant for maybe 24 months and their support is maybe 6 years of support if you're lucky with AMD and more like 8 years with NVIDIA. If I have to wait 4-6 months to get the full performance of my card, then any money you saved buying AMD is basically mute imo. The extra $50-100 is worth getting the full performance day 1 rather than waiting months for it. Especially if the issue is making the device completely unusable.   Then take into account black screen issues, game issues, multi-monitor power usage and inconsistent driver updates where like you said AMD may not ship a driver every month. I just never understood the FineWine thing... Now I will be fair and say NVIDIA's drivers honestly haven't been the best with Blackwell, but they've been just bad relative to how they were with Ampere, Pascal, Turing etc. They're still a lot better than AMD's worst driver moments the past couple of years and they're no where near Intel's driver problems for GFX. So NVIDIA is still the better choice in terms of driver support and I will give AMD credit, they held back RDNA4 to work on drivers more and it helped them a lot.  Either way, I'm tired of this duopoly and the GPU industry in general, too many people not willing to call out the BS from any of these companies and all of them are just screwing consumers. I honestly wished Intel was going to do better, but they've lagged for three generations now and they're looking like they'll abandon dGPU altogether.",Negative
AMD,I’ll gladly pay Nvidia $2000 for performance that laps everything else if it means I won’t need to worry about driver support being gone after a mere half decade. Nvidia JUST ended support for Pascal (as in they’re doing the same thing for a May 2016 GPU arch that AMD is now doing for a November 2020 arch).,Negative
AMD,"I'm also talking about stuff that happened almost 10 years ago.  But it is part of the reasons my friends and I have avoided AMD GPUs.  We had consistently had bad experiences with it, including driver related problems like this.  And here we are literally talking about AMD removing a feature from a product that released less than 3 years ago that nvidia is still supporting on products it released 7 years ago, and hasn't even included on anything newer than that.",Negative
AMD,"Vega/Radeon VII, RDNA1, and Vega APUs staring at you like Samuel L Jackson rn.",Neutral
AMD,"2 gens doesn't mean stuff , you could say the 7000 series are also 1 gen behind the 9000 series yet in most cases it's only a 5-10% difference.  These gpus are only 5 years old don't defend a multi billion dollar company it's not your friend dude.",Negative
AMD,Still better than fsr 3 by a lot. Fsr 4 peformance > fsr 3 quality,Positive
AMD,Nah that has been disproven.,Neutral
AMD,> amd probably thought it easier to take off the feature rather than get it working under a cve  You're probably right. That's exactly what Intel did with undervolting (laptop) CPUs a while back. It made me pretty upset given I couldn't rollback my BIOS far enough to get around it.,Negative
AMD,"Hopefully it's all a moot point and it works for OP anyway, due to needing less than 10 watts.  You're right though, I'm pretty sure there's inline power enhancement adapters for USB-C which would likely cost way less.",Positive
AMD,"Again, this is all on conjecture that's probably a moot point (7.2w should be easy even if PD is disabled), but probably because the adapter is hot garbage, at least so far as I've read/heard.  4K @ 120hz is a hard sell even under the best of circumstances, and being able to bypass any kind of active conversion in display/data pipes is definitely preferable.",Negative
AMD,The youngest GPU is 6750 GRE from October 2023. But there's handhelds that are being sold and released literally rn. Like the xbox ally (non x) for 600$ and base model legion go 2 for 1100$.,Neutral
AMD,"This + when the company isn’t a sole maintainer, they can’t just go and remove some stuff when they feel like it, because that will be contested by others. So the least they can do is not invest anything specifically to improve old hardware, but that mantle will be picked up by others evidently (in this case it’s a Valve contractor)",Negative
AMD,I got mine for 250CAD and new ones are now 300+ CAD it’s crazy! It’s a great card and you can play 1440 if you turn down a few settings.,Positive
AMD,"Interesting. Do you have some articles I could look at? I assume that FSR is powered by some kind of deep learning model and that this is a quantized version of that model.  I have not been using AMD for graphics for a little bit to be honest, so I don't really know what the latest developments are.",Neutral
AMD,"Yup, exactly. They did massive optimisations in RADV for FSR4 and it's FP8 on FP16 emulation",Neutral
AMD,It was when battery got down to 80% of capacity. they made that into a function,Neutral
AMD,Good. Punish these clowns with our wallets. I am upgrading my current 6800XT with the Nvidia 6xxx line-up and I threw my plans for AMD 10XXX cards in the garbage.,Negative
AMD,True words,Positive
AMD,Again you are using performance to judge if it's old or not.  Nvidia gpus get full feature and driver optimization for 5-6 years on average. So amd is not doing anything crazy here.,Neutral
AMD,Yep. I tried it for the first time on Outer Worlds 2 and it looks so much better I thought my brain was making shit up.,Positive
AMD,"Wait, that was the fix for plundervolt?!",Neutral
AMD,"It splits the signal, not conversion. Your GPU is doing the same thing over it's USB port.   They both maintain DP 1.4. One does it over USB-C DP alt and the other does it over a DP cable.   The VR2 adapter does what it should do, it's been reliable. The software was buggy in the beginning, but that wasn't exclusive to the adapter. What issues did you hear about?  The hub you linked requires thunderbolt host or USB4 for all the good features. It's an expensive path if you don't have a native port. Add in cards are pricey and didn't work well for me.  The [SUNIX UPA2015](https://www.sunix.com/en/product_detail.php?cid=1&kid=2&gid=11&pid=2146) is an option as well and cost ~$40",Neutral

AMD,"It's not really anything that is special magic be it DLSS, XeSS, or FSR4. It runs better on cards that have dedicated units for the precision/calculations being run. It's still just basically math and for this type stuff usually lower precision.",Neutral

AMD,This begs the question why AMD made an Int8 version when they could just do this instead and probably get better results.,Neutral
AMD,"> I wouldn't be surprised to see NVidia going the same route as AMD to cut costs now that the precedent has been set. I'd wager they're keeping a very close eye on consumer discord to see if they can follow suite.  I'm not sure what do you mean by this. AMD cutting driver support soon is nothing new. Ass stated, HD 6000 cards only had driver support for less than 5 years. That happened 10 years ago and nVidia hasn't followed suite.",Neutral
AMD,You are right.  I'm using an old as hell driver for my nvidia GPU because otherwise I run into issues.  And it probably only works for me because I'm too poor to play new games now.  If I ever get the chance to buy another GPU it probably won't be nvidia after this disaster and what they're doing with AI and their friendliness with fascism.  I just wish there were any good options.,Negative
AMD,Again 5 years isn't old.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, because if you ran the chips at a low enough power, it caused errors that could expose sensitive information.",Negative
AMD,Yes I know how running AI models works. You don't need to explain. I am asking for something specifically on FSR4,Neutral
AMD,"From all the info optiscaler devs could gather, the int8 version is older than any known fp8. Probably just internal testing and development on earlier hw.  FSR team is located in poland and they rarely, if ever, have access to pre-release hardware. Then FSR is rewritten from research models to C for GPU hw",Neutral
AMD,I’m surprised you so confidently said it *requires* hardware that RDNA 3/2 do not have when [this](https://www.techspot.com/article/3040-amd-fsr4-upscaling-older-radeon-gpu/) article (and many like it) blew up this very subreddit not even a month ago now. There are even articles about it running on the Steam Deck.,Neutral
AMD,"I didn't see those articles until I made that comment. Technically what I said isn't wrong. This is a different variant than the official FSR4 as the official FSR4 is FP8. This variant is Int8 and apparently has less performance. It's a different quantization. So someone has had to convert it to make it work, which is some what clever but it's not exactly the same thing.",Neutral
AMD,I don't even know what is what anymore.   Maybe this is exactly what they want. Maybe they have such an overabundance of Zen 2 and 3 supply that they don't know what to do with them.

AMD,"Ah, you are missing something really important here - what the actual customers want.  The customer for laptop chips is not the end consumer like you or I, but large laptop OEMs .  And those companies want regular rebadged names for the cheaper older chips, as they believe newer names equals more sales.  Hard to blame AMD for making their direct customers happy.    Note how for stuff that has more direct consumer sales like desktop chips they don't do the rebadge game (granted the desktop chips do have some questionable naming decisions, but the same chips keep the same name), likewise for the professional stuff.",Neutral
AMD,"There were SKUs that had a third and even a fourth digit in previous generations like the 5825U (mind you that is a Barcelo part, which was basically a small refresh of Cezanne). But AMD really popularized it and introduced it with the 7000 series to provide ""clarity"" as to what architecture something is. Why did they do that? Because in that same 5000 series lineup they had a mix of Zen2 and Zen3 parts. Like the 5300U which was Lucienne architecture, which was Zen2, but the 5800U was Zen3 Cezanne.  But it's just stupid because with the 6000 series, everything was Zen 3+, so whether you bought a 6800U or a 6600U it was all Zen3+. It didn't matter what you picked and tbh that's how they should have carried on, only make the new stuff the new generation naming.  In the 7000 series though they went back to the 5000 series naming sort of because they decided to mix old architectures again with the new stuff. For example, the 7735HS a Zen 3 chip and the 7745HX a Zen4 chip, that one third digit is supposed to notify you that you're buy Zen4, therefore it was as an indicator as to what Ryzen generation you were buying, but it just confused consumers even more because some people thought a 7640HS was worse than a 7735HS, but in single core the 7640HS beat the 7735HS and in multi-thread both were about even.  In the end, AMD made a shit solution to a shit solution, all of their own making and now they've come up with ANOTHER shit solution to try and ""fix it"".",Neutral
AMD,tangentially related but what exactly is nvidia going to do in 4 years when they need to release a card called the rtx 9070 when the rx 9070 already exists,Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, that was another own goal from AMD marketing. They were claiming 4070 performance (may even have been desktop 4070, but not sure anymore so I won't pushed that) then when it came out it turned out to be somewhere between mobile 4060 and mobile 4070. Plus the devices with that SKU are so expensive that you are better off buying an actual gaming laptop with a 4060 or 4070.",Negative

AMD,> it's previous generation silicon  Some of it is way worse than even that. There are _Zen 2_ chips (previous-previous-previous?) implicated here. That is some shamelessly re-badged garbage on AMD's part. These chips are barely even new enough to run Windows 11.,Negative
AMD,"No the real problem is they keep changing it every other generation. Maybe the new one makes more sense than the one before, but then again the one before that was even better. As a customer it is impossible for me to keep up, so the likelihood of me buying something expecting the latest CPUs and ending up with something from half a decade ago is disturbingly high. There is also no guarantee they won't change it again in a few years.",Negative
AMD,"For what it's worth, availability of the Athlon 7120U was **extremely** limited. I should know as I was trying to look for a laptop with that chip that didn't have 4GB of RAM with it, which effectively limited me to some really obscure HP slop box.   It doesn't make it excusable per se, but you'd have to stumble upon one of these completely at random or entirely intentionally to end up with one.",Negative
AMD,"The problem's that the moment these come onto the market isn't the moment every single older laptop gets wiped off the market, especially considering these are practically the same chips being re-released time and time again by AMD. Here's an example:  One customer looks at 5 budget laptops and their processors. #1 has a Ryzen 5 7520U, #2 has a Ryzen 3 7440U, #3 has a Ryzen 5 220, #4 has an older, discounted Ryzen 5 5600U, #5 has a Ryzen 5 40. Place your bets on the best one now.  Where do you even begin to compare these? Well, the Ryzen 5 7520U has a higher number than the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 5600U, so it should be better, right? Wrong. Both the 7520U and 7440U are 4-cores, 8-threads, but the Ryzen 5 7520U has a 15W TDP, 4MB of L3 cache, is Zen 2-based (from 2019), and has a Radeon 610M iGPU. Meanwhile, the 7440U has a 28W TDP, 8MB of L3 cache, is Zen 4-based (3 years newer), and has a Radeon 740M iGPU. It's going to be an order of magnitude faster than the chip that's a higher number than it. As for the Ryzen 5 5600U? It's a 6-core, 12-thread Zen 3 chip with a 15W TDP, 16MB of L3 cache, with a much inferior Vega 7 iGPU.  Okay... so the Ryzen 7520U is a no-go, and the Ryzen 7440U and Ryzen 5600U are kind of up for debate if you have a dGPU in these laptops (though absolutely pick the 7440U if the iGPU is the only form of graphics onboard). Well what's up with the Ryzen 5 40? What generation does that fall under? If the third digit of the 7000 series was architecture, and the first digit of the 5000 series was architecture, is the Ryzen 5 40... Zen 4 based? Well no, you're not supposed to know that, you're supposed to just believe it's a new chip. Well we know it's a Zen 2 4-core 8-thread with 4MB of L3 cache from the article, but this potential customer doesn't. They'll find it out if they research it, but by this point they're probably getting sick of researching CPUs when the vast majority of people know barely anything more than an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 being good, and an RTX graphics also being good. They most likely don't know anything about cores, architectures, TDP, or L3 cache, and probably just want a working laptop.  What about the, uh, Ryzen 5 220? That seems... probably a fair bit worse than the Ryzen 3 7440U and Ryzen 5 5600U going off the name and potentially being connected in naming scheme to the Ryzen 5 40, so it's worse, right? Nope. The Ryzen 5 220 is a 6-core, 12-thread, Zen 4-based, 28W chip with 16MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 740M graphics. A clear choice to pick that gets the best of both worlds with regards to the cores & cache of the older chip, and the newer architecture and iGPU of the newer chip.  Outside of this hypothetical scenario now, I want to add an honourable mention to compare to the Ryzen 5 220. I'd like to bring up the Ryzen AI 5 330, which is a Zen 5-based 4-core 8-thread 28W chip with 8MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 820M graphics. It's got less cores and less L3 cache than the Ryzen 5 220 and most likely will be worse in benchmarks [(and as a matter of fact, it is)](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6616vs6917/AMD-Ryzen-5-220-vs-AMD-Ryzen-AI-5-330), but despite this is a tier above (X20 v. X30) the 220, and very few will catch that the newer chip is worse than the older one. Even chips within this new naming scheme are inconsistent.  When these chips come out, the laptop market isn't going to have done away with the older chips for no good reason. [These chips are still out there](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Notebook-Keyboard-Professional/dp/B0FT3CR5VK), and customers looking for an AMD chip are gonna regret looking for one if they have to compare this kind of shit. This naming scheme's only a year old with the Ryzen AI 300 series, and the previous one (where the architecture was defined by the third digit) lasted two generations from 2023 to 2024. Pre-2023 laptops are perfectly usable for the average person and they're still going to be selling those laptops today, and god help anyone looking for an AMD laptop that has to deal with this naming BS. Intel's not much better with their 200V series but at least it looks like they're going to stay the course and keep using that naming scheme now that desktop and mobile are somewhat unified. AMD's just drunkenly driving off a cliff with their mobile naming scheme and landing on another cliff they'll drive off on in a year or two. Meanwhile, their desktop chips are very easy to understand in comparison. No random digit amount switching, no sneaky third digit signifying architectures, or any of that nonsense. The Ryzen 5 9600 is faster than the Ryzen 5 7600. Easy.",Neutral
AMD,"> How is it confusing?   I'm so confused as hell. There's also a 9000 series on laptops? Also, aren't the 300 series the ones with AI? But if they make 100 series, do the 100 series have AI too? But hey there's a 8945HS and that has AI. So does the 9000 series for laptop have AI too? What's the latest too, is it the 300 series or the 9000 series?

AMD,"You can judge a CPU based on if it's a Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, or Ryzen 7, but that's not really a good idea beyond a generalization. A Ryzen 7 1800X is much worse than a Ryzen 5 7600. An Intel i7-870 is much worse than an Intel i3-12100.  Going past the obvious, a Ryzen 9 9900X is worse for gaming than a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and Ryzen 7 5700 is worse than a Ryzen 5 5600 (because the 5700 is a special chip - whereas usually chips like the 5600 are based off lower-clocked 5600Xs under the same architecture, the 5700 is based off the 5700G with PCIe 3.0 and much lower L3 cache. This continues with mobile hardware, from my comment above, with CPUs like the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 7520U. One is two architectures newer, with double the L3 cache, double the TDP, with higher clocks, and a better iGPU. You'd think it to be the Ryzen 5 of the same ""generation"" (7000U) but it's not.  Desktop CPUs are easier (most of the time, there's still chips like the Ryzen 7 5700 though) but what I was saying up above is that AMD is making their laptop CPU naming schemes hard by switching them up every few generations, and it's almost certainly intentional to mislead consumers.",Negative

AMD,"Well AMD is doing a better job right now.   However I actually believe both manufactures have failed the APU market by not focusing more die space on things outside of the CPU core count.   The need for a bunch of relatively slow CPU cores is not what most of us wanted out of an APU.   8 simple fast CPU cores and a robust GPU would have been a better focus.   These days you need plenty of AI acceleration too.  Frankly the latest Strix APU's from AMD are a lot closer to meeting most users needs.   They still allocate a lot of space to CPU's but on the positive side the GPU is now robust and we have AI acceleration.  Of course Intels real failure is that they don't have a low power process which means they never had chips to put into NUC sized machines.   Even if they got the die allocation right, Intels chips would just run to hot.   So yeah AMD.   It would be even better if we had a high performance ARM based solution outside of Apple's.  Frankly Apple seems to know what to do with hardware these days (their software sucks but that is another manner) in a way that the other chip suppliers don't.

This will also likely get above its rated 2350mhz clock, and it's rated up to 2920mhz. But, Asrock rates their Taichi 9070XT at 2570mhz base and 3100mhz boost. That puts the 9070XT at a roughly 6% advantage if both are hitting their max clocks. Not much and I expect slight driver differences to exaggerate it a bit too.

AMD,"There are few key differences.  a) First, PCIe 5.0 interface rather than 4.0. So technically double the bandwidth if you DO need to send any data to the card during your wokloads.  b) 32GB VRAM vs 24GB IS a major difference for the use case. You can barely fit 16-17GB model on a 24GB VRAM card once you also count in the context size. But 32GB? Easy.  c) Blower style cooler and 2-slot height, AMD is generally speaking expecting most target users to be buying **two** of these.

Not only does it give you more versatility in productivity scenarios, but it also makes games run more smoothly at the same time (and in some instances, makes the difference between a game even running or not at all).  Honestly would be nice if we could swap out our V-ram, or had unified ram and could use our M-board ram for the GPU as well.  Or better still, dedicate 2 ram slots to the CPU, and the other 2 ram slots (which are usually empty and useless since you lose performance running 4 sticks in most scenarios nowadays) are dedicated to the GPU as MOAR V-RAM.  That would actually be epic and massively increase the adaptability and versatility of each individual GPU, which would also increase competition too (meaning cheaper GPU's that are also significantly better).",Positive

AMD,">A really fast ssd reads at 14GB/sec, so not much advantage from PCIe 5.0  It's 64GB/s vs 32GB/s (at x16 speeds). I am not saying you should stream data from your **SSD** into a GPU. More like RAM -> GPU. In some situations it will double your results. Admittedly for LLMs inference PCIe bandwidth is not THAT important (x4 4.0 so far seems to be sufficient) but it could make a difference in training.  >gpu can use more power and boost clocks to give you most performance when you need it  For LLMs it's primarily memory bandwidth that matters. Higher boost clocks mostly increase your electricity bill. It also means more heat and with a triple fan design bottom card just blows all the air back into your system.  >You can use riser cables for 7900XTX if you cant put two next to each other  You can if you have a massive case or are literally plugging video cards outside of it. On the other hand, consider a relatively cheap TRX50 board:  [https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/TRX50-AERO-D-rev-10](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/TRX50-AERO-D-rev-10)  You can shove 2-3x R9700 without any fiddling.  >Huge price increase for just 8GB extra, is not worth it  If you are after 24GB cards then you shouldn't buy 7900XTX either to begin with. You go on ebay and hunt for 3090s. Arc Pro B60 is an option too if you find it at a reasonable price.  32GB is a different story. Right now this is the cheapest card offering this much. Whether you personally find it worth it or not is a different story but as far as workstation grade hardware goes... honestly it's not **that** much of a markup. Just look at how much you pay for a consumer grade 5090, let alone an RTX Blackwell.",Neutral
AMD,"I definitely agree on wishing vram was upgradable by the user. Perhaps in the future something like LPCAMM could provide that suitable interconnect. A 128-bit interface per module would mean that even the biggest modern busses only need to fit 4 of them.  As for unified memory, I don't think many people on these forums will like the road that takes us down. Like it or not, the future (at least near future) of that path is things like Lunar Lake, Apple Silicon, and Strix Halo. Those are all very impressive SoCs, but you may have to trade the ability to upgrade your GPU separately from the CPU to get your upgradable unified memory.  As for dedicating certain slots on the motherboard to each side, CPU and GPU, that gets you the worst of both worlds in some ways. Your memory is no longer unified, the full bandwidth is not directly accessible to either in most architectures, but you can upgrade it. If you are going to go down the route of integrating the CPU and GPU to use the same memory and connections, give both access to all of it in full bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"Isn't AI memory intensive? Doesnt bandwidth matter? You can have faster compute units, but they can be memory starved. Also 7900xtx has more compute units, this should make up for some of the speed gap.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm with you on this. At 32GB+ your options are slim right now. The B60 Dual is the only other thing I find particularly attractive that is somewhat near this, though that is 2x24GB per card rather than a single 32GB. The W7800 also offers 32GB on a 256-bit bus, but this card is substantially faster than that and currently cheaper.",Positive
AMD,"How have I not hears of LPCAMM until now!?  Yeah, in an ideal world you would have M-board that has 3 separate chip sockets, one for your CPU, one for your unified RAM, and one for your GPU chip. It would probably look something like 3 CPU sockets.  Which would also make cooling very easy and scalable, something our current M-board layout didn't account for. They did account for development add-on cards however so it was a necessary step and an integral part of computer design history. However now that we've optimised general use computers to CPU, GPU, and RAM (ignoring storage, keeping that scalable with addon slots is definitely the way) I do definitely feel that new layout standard is due.  Of course that's an ideal world where CPU, GPU, and RAM manufacturers all agree on the same socket, we'd probably need some kind of modular M-board that allows the use of whatever Intel, Nvidia, AMD, etc.... GPU, CPU, and RAM sockets each company invents, otherwise you'd get stuck in a closed ecosystem where you're at the whim of the manufacturer of wether you're allowed to have more RAM or a more powerful GPU or a more efficient CPU or not.  Though it's nice to dream of a more optimal computer layout (of course my personal take is to have the CPU and GPU on opposite sides of the M-board, that way they each get their own separate airflow, and also the backside of each socket/slot can get some extra passive cooling which would help with the higher and higher clock speeds our chips are now reaching).  It is the worst of both worlds, however it is highly scalable and if the GPU had it's own dedicated memory controller then it could work as an alternative where you have double the memory, but each chip only sees half of that memory. I imagine in high-demand dynamic workloads where the CPU wants more RAM one second, then the GPU wants more ram the next, that having separated RAM for each chip could become a benefit and act as a safety margin. Though I do agree that it's probably not the best idea and would require just as much of a redesign as unified RAM would.  Unless you just put RAM stick slots on the GPU (probably a really good use case for LPCAMM as that would allow you to maintain the same backplate clearance standard current GPU's are built to) then independent scalable RAM would just be a direct upgrade to our current layout as-is.  Though I definitely want discrete chips on an M-board with unified memory (and probably some extra silicone chip, hell you could probably split the traditional rasterisation GPU chip and the RT/AI/Tensor/etc... chip into separate sockets) cause that would mean having 3-4 AIO's on your board with nothing else and that would just look too cool imho.",Neutral

AMD,"No doubt ""about"" it.",Neutral
AMD,"Not in the context of VRAM. You have two boxes 32cm long. Can you fit 45cm long figurine? Answer is no, it will just hit the side of one of the boxes. You can however fit two 32cm long figurines.  In ""AI"" world it works kinda similar. 2 cards of 32GB each can sometimes act as 2 devices with 32GB, can sometimes be used as 64GB with caveats OR actually behave as a 64GB VRAM pool.  For instance image generative AI has very dense, linear models. They have to fit in full. So for their purpose you have 2 GPUs, each with around 640GB/s bandwidth and 32GB memory each. You can produce twice as much AI slop by running 2 applications at once but you can't speed up producing a single one or use a really large model that exceeds 32GB.  In order to treat it as 64GB you would need to go over PCI Express bus instead and transfer data back and forth between cards. Which at x8/x8 configuration would be 32GB/s. So you can but it would absolutely slaughter your performance. Cards have to constantly communicate as each does the entire workflow.  But LLMs are different. You can split a 64GB model into 2 chunks of 32GB each. Card #1 does part of the workload, then it hands it to #2. They don't actually talk nearly as much. So for the biggest part 2 cards of 32GB = 64GB, they don't rely so much on PCI-Express.  And in the professional world there are also connections superior to PCIe. Nvidia H100 has like 3TB/s internal bandwidth but it also has 900GB/s NVLink. So if you need to stack 2 together - you can and performance penalty is not nearly as much as on consumer grade cards.  So yea, 2x32GB in PC world can sometimes mean it's still 32GB :)",Neutral

Fair. It's not a guarantee, only good for spitballing.  > I was concerned due to the newly released verdict on the 350 model from ComputerBase, a German tech news outlet.

They rated the limited warranty critical, and the majority of commentors also were concerned by the overall verdict.  > Overall I have a mixed outlook, but maybe I'm just being a little to paranoid. Unless further reviews reveal anything critical, I won't change my plans.  Maybe this is more hassle than it's worth to you, but you could probably sell the RAM for much more than you paid for it and pivot to a fully equipped mini-PC instead of a barebones one. There's a really wide range of HX 370 mini-PCs and companies like [BeeLink](https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser9-ai-9-hx-370) and [MinisForum](https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ai-x1-pro) have good reputations specifically for mini-PCs.

AMD,"Thanks.  Funnily enough, you are likely right on the RAM part. I bought a Kingston Fury 64GB kit this summer for 155€, it now goes for 280€. Turns out RAM prices went through the roof.   I've been following the scene since the start of the year now and originally tried the Acemagic F3A but wasn't satisfied with the build quality and company history. MinisForum's AI X1-Pro I ruled out because of of the speakers, size and bad PR on the MiniPC sub from high amount of bad RMA posts. The Ser9 I ruled out due to the weird internal design, speakers and bad wifi due to the full metal case. From what I remember, they use a extension board for the front and that is the reason why only of the USB-C ports is USB4.  The Edge AI 370 will likely be the cheapest option for me amongst reputable companies when it comes to 64GB of RAM. Additionally, I have 2x Western Digital Black 1TB NVMe's laying around that I plan to slap into that thing. One for Windows, one for Linux. Overall, I much prefer sourcing the parts myself. The size also became a big bonus, because it's meant to be a mobile workstation. Those few centimeters mean a lot.  I'll likely stresstest it when I get it and share my finding with the mini PC sub. If it runs fine, I'll keep it, else I'll make use of the return window and reconsider.",Positive

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Intel still trying to sell their already abandoned platform, they should learn something good from AMD and provide support for three generations per socket (and yes, Zen 6 will use AM5, already confirmed by AMD).",Neutral
AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Negative
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral
AMD,"> And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  Yeah, 10% less performance when frequency matched is quite a lot.",Negative
AMD,Telling people that its performance is better than it actually is?,Negative
AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Negative
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits. They are just as worse as shady company!",Negative
AMD,"Platform longevity isn't stupid lol. There's a reason why am4 is one of the best selling and one of the best platforms of all time. The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive
AMD,Quite common for AM4 in my experience.,Neutral
AMD,"My brother went from 1700X to 3700X to 5800X3D on AM4, so 10 years next year? I plan on upgrading to 3D cpu probably 9600X3D once its out or maybe 7800X3D (something more affordable but still somewhat better). Kinda want better 1% lows tbh, but maybe I’ll just wait for next ones unsure.",Neutral
AMD,"How is it stupid? On one hand, intel sockets used only 3 gens from 12th-14th while on the other hand amd has not only used 7000-9000 but will also be using zen 6. I don't think you realize just how big of a hassle changing motherboards are",Negative

AMD,I originally had a Ryzen 5 3600 and am now on a 5700x3d so it’s pretty relevant I’d say. Of course it’s anecdotal but I don’t think it’s too uncommon,Neutral
AMD,"I agree with you, it’s daft, no doubt about it. But you’ve got to factor in that people can be daft too. Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral
AMD,"They frequently revisit products and test old hardware, but naturally that's not going to be their focus. Channels with that focus like RandomGaminginHD fill that niche.",Neutral
AMD,Sooo they are in the YouTube space for the money not for the love of tech,Neutral
AMD,"So true. After all they are reviewer, it's their job to revisit something if it's worth to benchmark due to improvements.   Didn't they said they want to educate their viewers? If so then why being lazy? This is obvious they just care about making big headline which makes more money for them. It's BS!",Negative
AMD,"If only the Arc B770 can beat the RX 9070XT with performance and features, then I definitely stay on Intel's side, but RN I doubt it",Neutral
AMD,"Even accepting that as true, I don’t think it changes the main point I was making. Arrow Lake has probably improved versus a year ago. It’s probably not as good as intel is making out. A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.

Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3.

It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Negative
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral
AMD,So either a 200w igpu with a 300w intel cpu or an intel cpu with a 5030 slapped on it?  I think amd will be fine,Neutral
AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Positive
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral
AMD,a partnership doesnt mean they get free reign over license lol,Neutral

AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer.

AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits.

AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.

Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company.

AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Negative

AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache.

AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there. I hope they fund them properly and don't go the AMD route of having Ryzen and Radeon not work together due to pride.",Positive

AMD,Where to download this APO,Neutral
AMD,Except its THE game devs job to optimize games for multiple cpus and gpus.,Neutral
AMD,It’s literally their job to do so? wtf you talking about?,Negative
AMD,AMD also has Heterogeneous CPUs and even more so ARM cpus.  Devs should start to do this optimizations to schedule the stronger cores.,Neutral
AMD,"Will do, I got a 265K. Performance is already great tbh.",Positive
AMD,I love Intel but with how the company is doing right now I’m in a “I’ll believe it when I see it” type of skepticism.,Neutral
AMD,"Sorry I am making unreasonable requests. Can you test the game with APO on, and a few background tasks ? Like a few browser tabs, a youtube video playing, discord etc ? I am interested in the E-core usage, particularly the spread of E-core usage.   Thanks.",Neutral
AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative

AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Neutral
AMD,"Very cool. Cheers Intel! As a 6900XT owner, I use Xess whenever it's available. The DP4A version got very solid once V1.3 hit.  Hopefully more devs implement it.",Positive
AMD,"I like how Intel still support DP4A model. My meteor lake chip gonna love this XeSS2 with FG and LL.  Meanwhile Amd give middle finger to their consumer who don't have radeon 9000 series, FSR4 doesn't works at all on their previous GPU including the flagship rx 7000 series.",Positive
AMD,Did the DP4A version also improve from 1.3 to 2.0?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought it was a mix of both shader model 6.4+ and DP4a, not either or",Neutral
AMD,Okay but why would I want to use that instead of NVIDIA DLSS?,Neutral
AMD,It’s the least you should get after not getting FSR4.,Negative
AMD,You'd use it over FSR if that's available too?,Neutral
AMD,Except you NEVER got acces to the DP4a version tho. Intel cross vendor locked the DP4a path to their igpus and only allowed Shader Model 6.4 version for other gpus.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4.   On Linux they managed to emulate it using the FP16 instruction, which is available on RDNA3, but it seriously impacts performance and introduces 1,5ms of input latency, compared to the 0,5/0,8ms of latency on RDNA4 with hardware FP8.",Negative
AMD,And they expect people who bought previous RDNA to buy more RDNA,Neutral
AMD,Not by a significant amount.,Neutral
AMD,DP4a only relevant for intel igpus as its crpss vendor locked by intel. Other gpus only get the Shader Model 6.4 version.,Neutral
AMD,for the games that dont support DLSS,Negative
AMD,"If you own a card that doesn't support dlss.   This is an extra option, it doesn't affect your choice to run dlss or not.",Neutral
AMD,10 series cards will benefit from this,Positive
AMD,It's great news for gpu that can't use dlss because fsr3 is a blurry shitfest.,Negative
AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler). So if I'm not running Xess DP4a then what am I running?,Neutral
AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right? FSR 3.1 is so bad even when compared to Intel XeSS 1.3 DP4A, but Amd refuse to improve it because they want to force people to buy radeon 9000 series.",Negative
AMD,"Amd really all in when it comes to copying Nvidia. Guess what? The more you buy, the more you save!",Positive
AMD,DP4a is cross vendor.   XMX is Arc only.,Neutral
AMD,DLSS is the widely adopted upscaler in the current market. I'd be shocked if a major game in 2025 releases without DLSS at the very least.,Neutral
AMD,1080ti heard no bell,Neutral
AMD,"You run the Shader Model 6.4 version which i stated. There was a discussiona bout DP4a being cross vendor locked but for the life of me i cannot find it again. The article you linked is from 2021, in early 2022 intel cross vendor locked DP4a. The main article of the post clearly states Shader Model 6.4.",Neutral
AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.  I think this also the reason why they never update APO game support again. Obviously optimizing their platform by working directly with game developer is better than doing it by themself.

AMD,"It's not like game runs bad on Intel CPU which has P and E cores, i will be lying if i say that. It's about maximizing CPU performance. CPU demanding game will runs with much higher FPS when it knows which thread should be utilized.    This is why game with APO enable like R6S on i9-14900K at 1080p low settings, it got performance increase up to 100FPS which is massive.",Neutral
AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much. That's why Intel HEDT and AMD's Threadripper aren't of much use in this regard.",Neutral
AMD,"No, that's because and isn't really better for gaming unless you get their x3d variants. Those have a different style of memory that is better for gaming in particular but can underperform when it comes to workload tasks. Idk why 🤷",Negative

AMD,Wouldn't the 300 series actually be Arrow Lake Refresh?,Neutral
AMD,"Videocardz is wrong      This chip will likely be called ""Core Ultra 5 445k"" it's an 8+16 die with bLLC + 4LPe   (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")    Ultra 3 has 4P + 4E + 4LPe  Ultra 5 has the 1x 8+16 tile + 4LPE   Ultra 7 has 8+6 P-Cores and 16+8 E-Cores +4LPe   Ultra 9 had 2x 8+16 tiles + 4LPe tile   Ultra 300 series will be reserved for mobile only Panther Lake and/or Arrow Lake Refresh   Ultra 400 will almost certainly be Nova Lake.",Neutral
AMD,I think this competition will tight up alot in the next gen for both intel and AMD.  Intel has had a superior memory controller for awhile now and AMD will finally address this in Zen 6.

AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral

AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down.

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral

Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell.

AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides.

AMD,Is anyone left?,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral

AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience.

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm highly suspicious, for packaging reasons if nothing else. I'm not going to call it impossible, but that would put enormous strain on the X dimension.

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral

AMD,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Negative

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling.

Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

AMD,So what is the QVL list for x299 VROC? I can’t find that information. I can find QVL for C621,Neutral
AMD,"So I was able to download the files from the RDC. Currently when I run        eeupdate64e.efi /NIC=2 /DATA Dev_Start_I210_Copper_NOMNG_4Mb_A2.bin  It says ""Only /INVM* and /MAC commands are valid for this adapter. Unsupported."" This is for three 8086-1531 Intel(R) I210 Blank NVM Device. Presumably in order to program them with device id 1533, I need to run a different command or use a different tool?  Thank you for your help, I feel like it is very close to working.  Edit: I believe it works, using /INVMUPDATE",Neutral
AMD,"[This is literally what I am dealing with.](https://imgur.com/a/WBowyjO)  I'm not even worried about posting this image because please tell me how to get a better photo than this with a regular smart phone, and you can barely see there's anything there.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, I've turned off the system animations, and the blinking cursors.  There aren't settings to switch fonts, to replace thin/faint fonts with bold ones. The folks developing Windows like Segoe Ui, maybe they can read it. There are regedit hacks, but I'm not sure how to do them. There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked. So far it has worked everywhere with dark text on light images, and it's worked very well.",Negative
AMD,I'm now on the new BIOS (with Intel default settings) and the crashing is still occurring on Core 8. Alas... I was really hoping that would fix it.  What are the next steps?,Negative
AMD,"u/Hippieman100 Ah, I see I overlooked that part! Looks like this is the installer version, my apologies for the confusion since we were discussing three different software options earlier.  Alrighty, since you're using the latest version now, how can I help? Are you running into any issues with the new application, or is there a specific feature that's not working as expected?",Neutral
AMD,"u/TheCupaCupa Great to hear it fixed itself! If it happens again, trying Turbo off sounds like a good plan.",Positive
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Neutral
AMD,Relax 😅 and follow this:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005609/processors.html,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah switching fonts, I haven't tried it. But in windows settings you can change its size and such. Try looking at the Microsoft community or support changing it. But I am glad that adjusting the gamma helps.",Neutral

AMD,"Thank you for the reply. Sadly asrock doesn’t have a QVL for nvme drives in U.2 form factor or enterprise grade drives, just m.2. Let alone a QVL for VROC support. Looks like I’ll be the test subject for this.",Negative
AMD,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology. My phone is 4 years old and was absolutely not capable (Samsung S20+)",Negative
AMD,u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  **Best of luck with your configuration!** Your pioneering work might just pave the way for others looking to implement similar setups.,Positive
AMD,"u/Danderlyon  **just sent you a message, check your inbox when you get a chance!**",Neutral
AMD,"Just wanted to follow up for anyone seeing this or is in a similar boat. I can confirm that Intel DC P4510 drives will work in a VROC Raid using a standard key.      Not sure if intel support can confirm but it appears the ASROCK X299 Taichi CLX supports VROC Raid across multiple VMD Domains, which is supposed to be locked behind Xeon scalable CPU/Chipsets. I need to buy two more drives and try to add them to my array to confirm.",Neutral
