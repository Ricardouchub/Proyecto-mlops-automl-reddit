Intel,"The B50 appears to be an decent low-end workstation GPU, at least as long as the intended workloads don't effectively require CUDA in any way, shape, or fashion.    My one lingering question is what use cases actually *require* the certifications of a workstation-class GPU (which would rule out something like a relatively similar consumer-tier RTX 5060 Ti / 16GB) but wouldn't benefit from CUDA?

Pathetic products.",Negative
Intel,SR-IOV is the selling feature for me and why I have one ordered. Getting a Tesla P4 with nvidias vgpu licensing working is a pain in the ass and expensive.

Intel,"iirc, SR-IOV and VDI support in the coming months, toggleable ECC support, and it is ISV certified",Neutral
Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral
Intel,Software support is a thing. CAD applications like solidworks and inventor don’t officially support the GeForce rtx or radeon rx line of gpus and they’re considered untested unsupported options.

Intel,Grid licensing can be faked if you depend on a sketchy github driver that only works on Turing GPUs. You certainly don't want to be doing that in a professional setting where licensing costs are not a massive expense anyways.,Negative
Intel,"I believe mobile is the main reason they continue developing ARC IP, highly integrated SoC are crucial for lower power consumption and performance per watt, as more and more mobile designs are becoming more integrated (see strix halo for example) Intel knows it has to continue developing graphics IP that is competitive with competition. As for discrete cards, this is a battle in the long run to win, but it will take serious investment, we can hope that they won't axe as part of cost cutting measure.",Positive
Intel,"The B50 (16Xe cores) is pretty cut down compared to the full G21 (20Xe)die, it has 2600mhz boost clocks instead of the 2850mhz on the gaming cards, it uses 14GB/s memory (19Gbps on gaming cards) and it has a 128bit bus with 8 memory chips (B580 has 192bit bus with 6 memory chips)  The only costly thing about is the 2 additional memory chips.   I'm not saying it's extremely profitable but it can't be too expensive to make since a portion of the volume is likely faulty G21 dies that can't make a B580 or B580.   If Intel can sell the B580 for $250 without too much pain, then the B50 is probably making a profit",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah, if ECC is a hard requirement for whatever reason then that would certainly rule out all the GeForce-branded RTX cards.

Intel,I’ve been working in a professional aechtiectural environment for 5 years and haven’t seen the need for ECC once.   Can you explain situations where it’s needed? I’ve always wondered.,Neutral
Intel,"SR-IOV for (license-free!) vGPU is IMHO the killer feature here, perhaps along with being able to get 16GB of VRAM per card relatively cheaply and without needing auxiliary power.  Both open up interesting server and workstation use cases that can't be had cheaply from the competition.",Positive

Intel,"You can buy it off AIB Partners but you can't buy it at retail (i.e. microcenter, newegg] and it doesn't have an official MSRP yet.   The prices you see now are what AIB's want to charge in bulk orders.    If you want to know how much let's say 5 B60's cost you have to get a quote from a distributor",Neutral
Intel,They need GPU IP for two things: client and AI. Anything else is expendable.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, my point was *if* they have the gaming cards, they can justify the professional line, but it's not nearly big enough to justify making a dGPU to begin with.",Neutral
Intel,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Intel,RTX 3090 Ti and RTX 4090 have ecc. Not that they're cheap.,Neutral
Intel,"It's needed whenever the work you're doing matters and a single-bit error could cause significant harm.  Something like audio or video, a single-bit error probably isn't very noticeable.  Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).  If in doubt, you want ECC, but market segmentation to mostly restrict ECC support to ""server"" chips and boards and charge more for ECC memory means you'll overpay for it.",Negative
Intel,"For rendering and most graphics use cases, ECC really doesn't matter that much.   But for a few very specific compute cases. Like long running numeric simulations, it can make a difference. This is for stuff that is going to be long running and relies on numeric/data accuracy, ECC tends to be appropriate.",Neutral

Intel,"but you can still do gpu paravirtualization without sr-iov using Mediated Passthrough, API Forwarding (RemoteFX) or Dedicated Device Assignment",Neutral
Intel,"The problem with Gaudi (I know, I've written code and run training runs on it) is simply that the programming model is not oneAPI, or whatever oneAPI becomes. Yes, pytorch works, but people care a lot about software longevity and long term vision when buying $5mm+ of GPUs (and these are the purchases Intel cares about that can actually start to offset the cost of development).   The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package. Unifying graphics and compute packages is what NVIDIA was able to achieve but not yet AMD, and it's really great for encouraging ML development in oneAPI.  See this post to see where Intel would like to be: https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-2-8-brings-native-xccl-support-to-intel-gpus-case-studies-from-argonne-national-laboratory/ (they don't mention the ""XPU"" because it's Ponte Vecchio, which are iiuc worse than A100s).",Neutral

Intel,"Mediated pass though requires big ass license fees vGPU/MxGPU, and isn't FOSS other than Intel's currently broken support that they abandoned for SR-IOV support.  API forwarding only support limited host/guest setups, and even more limited API support. The only FOSS support is VirGL, which only support Linux host/guest and only OpenGL.  Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time. Plus you are limited on virtual machine by the physical GPU count. It works with Intel GPUs and is FOSS with them.  SR-IOV on Intel fixes all of that. It works amazingly well with their iGPUs, has no license issues, and is fully FOSS.",Negative
Intel,Hey no need to be aggressive towards the other user. Your comments are very helpful and I appreciated them a lot but keep it constructive please!,Positive
Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral
Intel,"It's good they launching this, this card adds some competition to the landscape, but before anyone buys it they should figure out if their drivers are lighter weight.

Intel,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working. Those will be some absolutely sad little GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,> It's also a 50 series card that costs $250.  I'll believe that when I see it in stock for 250. MSRP is meaningless if the product isn't available for that price.,Neutral

Even using purely stats from the article, b580 is 3% better with 4gb more VRAM than “worst gpu ever”, so I don’t see how this translates to a win for the b580. Being better than a terrible product by a hair doesn’t exactly make it good.",Negative
Intel,Same can be said for the 5050 no? Both have CPU overheads unlike AMD which any mid-range AMD GPU can easily outperform Nvidia's 5090 at 1080p.   The 12GB VRAM however are better suited for people who are stuck at older Gen3/Gen4 PCIE speeds.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll run nearly every game in existence at 1080p with playable framerates with the right settings. IDK why it would be a product for non-gamers.

It's so bad that even the prebuilts with the 16GB 9060XT will be outsold by prebuilts with a 5050 at the same price range, as companies like to pair trash GPUs with ""high"" end CPUs like a 13700F to clear stock but the ""i7"" allows them to mark up the price.",Negative

This card is 80% the performance of a 5060, which should probably be called the 5050.  To take it a step further, the GT 1030 was 13% of the 1080ti, the 5050 is 20% of the 5090. The 1050 was 25% of the 1080ti, so it would be reasonable to call this a 5040 or I could even be satisfied with 5040ti.",Neutral

Intel,"It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup. You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral

Intel,"They re not the same price tier either bro... They could have called the 5090 a 5095ti if that makes you happier.  The guy you quoted is right.   Also comparing the performance diff between the 1030 vs 1060 because guess what the 5060 should have been the 5050 looking at die size and memory bus.   Not sure why people keep defending these naming schemes, do you think the engineers use them internally lol? Its bullshit that marketing comes up with",Negative
Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters. How large the top die is and what core configuration it has. Is irrelevant for the value for cards further down the stack.",Neutral

Intel,"Imo, the lockdown of virtualization started before AI, as Nvidia and AMD didn't want people buying cheap GPUs to virtualize corporate environments.      At least that's the context that I'm most familiar with for this. A lot of small to midsize companies barely need the GPU for their individual VMs so being able to split a single GPU against a beefy CPU would be a good cost saver to avoid the professional GPU tax.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel has said that SR-IOV will come to consumer. Even if it doesn’t, their GPUs aren’t super expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"Splitting a GPU is so that you can run multiple VMs with each GPU. Any AI training and any inference on LLMs or similarly large models wants to run *one* application across many GPUs.

Intel,I remember when he said that Intel were scumbags  did he change his mind?,Neutral
Intel,Don’t get fooled by 48GB. The card actually behaves as 2 cards of 24GB with pcie x8 lanes each of gen 5.0 in bifurcation mode. So for gaming most likely you will be getting only 24GB of vram (which is still not bad). But this card really shines in AI or other professional loads because they are claiming that you can have one big shared memory across multiple cards with their drivers and without any physical connectors like crossfire or sli. This means you can run full fat deepseek completely locally on your physical system with something like 4 of B60 on a threadripper system. God damm never even imagined that intel would be shining in GPU segment.,Neutral

Nvidia just hide it away from customers and sell it as nvlink (with some upgrades) for high end component for commercial side because they didn't want people stacking their cheaper cards.

Intel,Unfortunately this is just a way to get more GPUs into one system. There’s nothing like SLI.,Negative
Intel,No need for SLI to use multiple GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,"no this particular card does not support sli. this is just to increase the gpu density in a given system. Increased from 1 gpu per slot to 2 gpus per slot.   According to linux tech tips, the memory sharing between cards are done on the software level, which in my opinion is not a good thing. the pci-e gen5 x8 bus has a memory bandwith of 32GB/s in one direction (latest nvlink support up to 900GB in one direction). More inter-card bandwidth = better performance on large models (assuming the model support multi-gpu setup). No dedicated inter-card interface certainly will harm the maximum theoratical performance in certain workloads.",Neutral
Intel,"Me too. Based on the TOPS, the inference speed seems to be roughly comparably to a 3060TI for the B60 and the Dual being roughly comparable to a 4080, though i think realistically more like a 3080/4060 due to the bandwiths. I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them. It's pure market manipulation and artificial deflation of the specs to drive pro customers to more expensive hardware at consumer's burden.",Neutral
Intel,"Tokens/second won't be as good as a high end Nvidia card obviously, but you'll be able to fit a much larger model onto it than you could for any consumer and almost any Nvidia card. And for $1000, you could run four of these and still come out way cheaper than one A6000.",Positive
Intel,"Since I've run a bunch of tests on Xe2 (and of course plenty of Nvidia and AMD chips):  * A 70B Q4 dense model is about 40GB. w/ f16 kvcache, You should expect to fit 16-20K of context (depends on tokenizer, overhead etc) w/ 48GB of VRAM. * B60 has 456GB/s of MBW. At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.  Like for Strix Halo, I think it'd do best for MoE's but there's not much at the 30GB or so size (if you have 2X, I'd Llama 4 Scout Q4 (58GB) might be interesting once there are better tuned versions.",Neutral

The embedded vram can't be repaired, so once vram died whole gpu is pretty much gone.",Negative

Intel,That’s true and product segment itself focuses on AI. But the fun part is bifurcated dual GPUs. And unlike Nvidia they are claiming to have support for both game-ready and professional drivers at same time. This means you can be professional video editor by day and gamer by night (or gamer by weekends or vice-versa 😄) all with one card without tinkering drivers or monitor ports. And by the way unlike AMD they have great support for video encoding and decoding. I am really excited to see all these various combinations of things on this card.,Positive

And plenty of people use their commercial cards for gaming, literally some of earliest adaptors of nvidia cards were chief tech leads playing games on their workstations in afterhours, as described in many interviews and books such as the recent The Nvidia Way.   And Sli was fine once they made G-Sync, which was from the discovery of microstutters as a big problem.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, that's why I said:    >...sell it as nvlink (with some upgrades)...     Also, I bet that most people would gladly take just the standard sli without the nvlink improvements simply for the larger vram.    Edit: I was wrong, see below. Cunningham's Law",Neutral
Intel,"The question is less about stability and more about support.  AMD's ROCm support is basically on a per-chip basis. If you have gfx1100 (navi31) on Linux you're basically have good (not perfect) support and most things work (especially over the past year - bitsandbytes, AOTriton, even CK now works. I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.  I think the real question you should ask is what price point and hardware class are you looking for and what kind of support do you need (if you just need llama.cpp to run, then either is fine, tbt).",Neutral
Intel,"Hmm re-reading, I may have brain-farted the CU math, Arc 140V (Lunar Lake) is I believe 32 TFLOPS so obvs G21 should be higher.

Intel,But you get 48GB of VRAM for that price.,Neutral
Intel,"Intel has a currently working but not released software to share video memory across multiple GPUs for the purpose of AI and such with minimal performance loss. It is effectively 48GB worth of video memory for the tasks these GPUs are designed for.  These cards might be slower than other solutions, but they will be thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars cheaper. Stuff like this (and AMD's AI MAX+ 395) allow companies to have each dev be able to host their own full size(or at least near full size) AI model on their own workstation instead of fighting over time on the big server. They also allow hobbyist to work with much larger models than they usually would be able to.",Neutral
Intel,"The nvlink improvements are what *allow* for larger vram.  SLI's biggest problem was that GPU memory had to be duplicated across all cards, meaning if you put 2x 8gb cards in SLI, you still only had 8GB effective vram. NVLink allows for memory pooling, SLI did not.",Neutral

Intel,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",Negative

From the past, my favourite of these (although I guess it's a different, more unique case) is the Nvidia GTX 295x2. For context, the 295 was a dual-GPU version of the GTX 280 which worked through the now-defunct SLI protocol. EVGA's engineers had the bright idea of making a dual-GPU version of this dual-GPU card, and so they essentially made their own SKU where they linked up two of these cards to form a quad-GPU card. Absolutely insane stuff, and the heat produced from it and the power usage to run it was insane, but in games that supported SLI (which was a bit shoddy) it was an absolutely insane card.",Neutral

It's common here to pool the VRAM of many GPUs together to go even larger - even if no NVLink/InfinityFabric are supported, with PCIe.   In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) specifically, the more VRAM the more fine details you get resolved in the turbulent flow. Largest I've done with FluidX3D was [2TB VRAM across 32x 64GB GPUs](https://youtu.be/clAqgNtySow) - that's where current GPU servers end. CPU systems can do even more memory capacity - here I did a simulation in [6TB RAM on 2x Xeon 6980P CPUs](https://youtu.be/K5eKxzklXDA) - but take longer as memory bandwidth is not as fast.   Science/engineering needs more VRAM!!",Neutral

Intel,"32GB is great for local AI. It's the best a reasonably affordable card can provide atm (5090). Basically the more the better, if the 5090 has 48GB it would be an even better card, if it has 96GB like the RTX Pro 6000 then it would be better still.",Positive
Intel,"With that specific card maybe not, but it could do two things to help gamers.   If it's successful, Intel's dGPU gets more cash infusion and leads to better cards down the road which might compete in the high end gaming market. Having another player is always a good thing.   It might force NVIDIA to compete by lowering prices so not to lose market share on the Ai and workstation side of things, which means the better gaming cards do get cheaper.",Positive

But the die was canceled during development along with L4 Adamantine cache, which was also planned to be used in Meteor Lake's igpu.  BMG-G10 would've likely been a bloated die if it targeted 2850mhz clock speeds like the B580. Less so if they targeted lower clocks.

Intel,That 11K GPU has 3X VRAM and 2X performance.  A lower end is likely not leaving too big a gap.   More importantly is how the Intel pro compares with AMD pro,Neutral
Intel,2 5060Ti 16Gb will run them faster and probably for less money.,Neutral
Intel,"In addition, used prices are normally lower than for similar new items, accounting for the relatively higher risk involved and shorter (on average) remaining lifespan.  For example, you can find a used 4060 8gb for significantly cheaper used on Ebay than the same card new on Newegg.",Neutral

Intel,"To be fair, an LLM could be a pretty nice tool if shit hits the fan.   I have a 8kw generator and solar panels that will work as backup power if things goes sideways. Of course I have books too, and a full copy of Wikipedia on a small usb drive that I refresh once a year. Oh, and I live pretty remotely.   LLMs are not a substitute for actual knowledge, but in a scenario where the internet is turned to mush, time is of essence and maybe it can allow me to do stuff I won’t have time to fully learn on my own, especially for one-off tasks. I don’t expect to get an LLM to guide me through how to remove my own spleen, but it would probably be able to help me with spot knowledge. Could even load it with schematics, manuals, books on a myriad of subjects.",Neutral
Intel,"I dont know whats in that sub, but given what scenario typical preppers think will happen guns would be useful to hunt food if nothing else.",Neutral
Intel,You are questioning the other person's priorities based on your perceived impact of an internet outage.    Maybe LLMs are their hobby and they experience frequent internet outages. Why would it be so weird to want to run LLMs when the internet goes down.,Negative
Intel,Most pre-made survivalist packs now come with a portable solar panel. Good enough to charge stuff like phone/flashlight/radio.,Positive
Intel,>If you are in a survival situation you probably dont have electricity either.  You could buy a single single solar power station and couple of panels for not much more than a grand. Which would be able to run a desktop PC for a couple of hours a day.   Sure wont be enough panels and storage to run it continuously. But makeshift off grid solution like that are getting crazy affordable these days. It's starting to get to the price point where it should simply be something you should have in some form if you live somewhere where you can expect power outages every now and then. Since then you can use it for things like running a freezer and basic lighting.,Neutral

Intel,that sounds needlesly complicated. You can buy portable solar panels for less that are good enough to charge phone/flashlight/radio.   That guys LLM sounds more like what person i know does. He works on ships that cross the atlantic ocean. Internet access is still rare there. So he pre-downloads enough stuff for local use. Power isnt an issue on a ship.,Neutral
Intel,"Which is understandable in our current situation  But this comment chain started as a discussion of a doomsday scenario, where very few or no doctors might be available   Google and mayo clinic servers would most likely be down, so i think a local AI would probably be better than nothing",Negative

Intel,"To make it easier to understand, it is similar to AMD: RDNA1/2/3/4 is the underlying architecture and Navi 1x,2x,3x,4x are the implementations.",Neutral
Intel,Interesting. Someone also told me that SWC is a lot closer in design to Intel's TSU than NVIDIA's SER.  The inconsistent gaming performance of Battlemage could be related to a broken TSU implementation.

You could try a 9060 xt, to get 16gb of vram to help give your GPU more legs to play longer since a 7500f should still be well suited for that GPU. It is likely about $100 more though.   I see nothing wrong with this build for what your assumed goal is, you could probably squeeze more out of your budget with a different mobo, case, and cooler and upgrade the GPU at most and stay in budget.",Positive

Intel,"you can shave of like $25 off the SSD with a 2tb $100 SDD instead. You can also shave 17$ off the cooler by getting a regular assassin instead of the double radiator version, since you don't need a double radiator to cool the 7500f. And you can save money on the power supply by opting for a 650w supply instead. Gives you plenty of wattage overhead as well. All those savings can allow you to get a better GPU like the Radeon RX 9060XT 16gb",Neutral

Intel,"buy a better gpu because it sounds like you're really only interested in playing games at max fidelity, so a good GPU will take you way further than any monitor currently can. IMO, a good/great monitor should be the last thing that you get because if max frames is the goal, it's smarter to see where your personal cutoff is (in regards to resolution/fidelity with your current setup) and whether or not you're really wanting to buy pricier hardware to max out your current monitor or upgrade to a monitor with higher specs or a different panel type like W/QD-OLED",Positive

Intel,"There is definitely a noticeable difference between a nice IPS panel monitor and a QD/W-OLED monitor, there's absolutely no debating this. But where objectivity ends, subjection begins and this is where your personal standards come into play. For me personally, growing up playing games on low resolution CRT monitors, I only care that I can play my games of choice, so I would personally be happy with a decent IPS monitor because the games won't care if I'm playing on a nice monitor or not, but they will care what hardware I'm playing on. So I would go with the 5070/60 Ti and a decent monitor. The B580 will struggle more with a nicer OLED panel anyway due to the more demanding specs.",Neutral

Intel,"The Intel arc GPUs used to be avoided because of the drivers. Some games straight up don't work with them, some had way worst performance than the competitions. Intel's driver has improved leaps and bounds, it's a great one to get unless you have a really dated CPU.",Negative
Intel,"I just got one and it’s awesome, $395 AU and I got a nice increase at 1080p. Made it very cheap to upgrade!   I think my end game is to try get the next line of graphics card at early retail price, or just hop on the next Intel… tbh done me great. The only problem I have had so far was tabbing out of helldivers caused a few glitches on my mates end for the 15 seconds I was gone.",Positive
Intel,"Their A series gpus had some major issues alongside drivers still being pretty raw. The a310/380/580 have some niche uses in video encoding or for driving 1080p displays.   The B series cards have turned out to be really good budget gpus for 1080/1440p. The drivers have come a long way since launch, theyre still not as refined as Nvidia but theyre mostly stable now. They both require more modern platforms to perform well but not the top end hardware alot of reviews claim they need. The b580 has had alot of issues staying in stock since it offers 12gb of vram at a price point that almost exclusively offers 8gb cards.  Ive had my b580 since around launch. I got it on launch day for MSRP and aside from an unstable driver update i had to roll back its been a great upgrade from the 1070 i had previously. If you play on 1080/1440p displays at high settings theyre good cards",Neutral
Intel,"Intel arc a310 is one of the best cards for transcoding videos, can handle multiple 4k streams. I love mine, using it for plex server and immich",Positive
Intel,It's good,Positive
Intel,No they aren’t. The b580 in particular is praised for its great value at its price range,Positive
Intel,As long as your CPU and motherboard supports RE-Bar it's a great option for 1080p/1440p for the price,Positive
Intel,Idk but I take it as a good sign because people will only post if there is something wrong with the product. This also applies to other subreddits.,Negative
Intel,"They're good and I have one that I use for a rig that only plays games like esport titles and multiplayer steam games. They aren't the best for any type of AAA game.  The bigger deal is that intel has announced some pretty heavy changes and cuts coming and there is good speculation that intel's gpu sector might be cut. If it doesn't happen, it's no big deal, but if it does get cut or restricted, any type of updates or driver updates that are needed for future releases will probably be unlikely to come out. That's probably the only reason I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but for the price its great for someone who only enjoys current multiplayer games or indie games.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel Arc has physical hardware that works ok, but it's not high performance yet.  But MOST importantly, this is a new company in terms of graphics drivers and industry cooperation in software development. So what? NVIDIA and AMD partner with game developers to optimize graphics, sample and super-sample textures in AI for optimization for best performance. This is an ongoing development of specialized software and tools to improve performance to the maximum with the given hardware. This software is NOT available to Intel and they will have to spend years catching up to their competition.  In short, Intel graphics cards will work fine for low demand popular programs. They may eventually get there for high end performance, but it will take years for them to catch up.",Positive
Intel,"Have you considered 9060 xt at all? There has been a price decrease recently, you might be able to get one for the same price as a b580 (8gb model 9060 xt).  Except for the vram department, the 9060 xt is pretty much better in every way and performs better too.  Was on the same boat with you. The b580 was $360 CAD, and the 9060 xt 8gb was $380. After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet. I wish it was at least 10gb though…. Amd really missed an opportunity. Otherwise this gpu is a beast! I’ve never seen an 8gb gpu do so well at 1440p. Amd did score with that.",Positive
Intel,They are good for 1080p gaming also if you have a really low budget and want to game. For slightly more money you can pick up a 9060xt 16gb which is good for 1440p and has better long term returns.,Positive
Intel,"They're okay, if you hate yourself get an Intel Arc GPU otherwise get an AMD Radeon GPU or if you have the money to burn literally and figuratively speaking an Nvidia GPU.",Negative
Intel,I think better price to performance can be found on a used card.,Neutral
Intel,"Has driver issues with more dated and/or less popular games, but they've made it a point that major AAA titles and esports games usually have good drivers. It also basically requires a fairly beefy CPU and it will at least slightly negatively impact the CPU performance too. But when I say fairly beefy I basically just mean AM4 5000 series or basically any AM5 CPU even the 7500f, I personally don't know the Intel comparison but I imagine any Core Ultra or 12th gen would absolutely crush it and be fine.  But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs. Although FSR4 and the better raytracing on the 9000 series might've changed that, a lot of those comparisons were from when we were still comparing to the RTX4000 and RX7000 cards.",Neutral
Intel,B series is getting a bit old now. Eagerly awaiting what the C series will bring.,Neutral
Intel,No idea about the drivers but B570 and B580 which released some months ago are very good value and also very efficient.,Positive
Intel,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates. We're talking 150 fps instead of 300fps, big deal.",Positive
Intel,No one buys them because people truth internet myths even from years ago but the reality is that those are very good gpus and near to MSRP are a great value.,Positive
Intel,"They're decent GPUs but for gaming yo'ull want something a lot more powerful, like an RTX 5070 or RTX 5070 Ti.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcKPJvGNr0c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcKPJvGNr0c)",Positive

Intel,B series launched literally under a year ago.,Neutral
Intel,Depends. For gaming? Not really. Better bargains. But for a home server the a310 is the champ of media encoding,Neutral
Intel,"In gaming, the B series will generally be better in pretty much every way. It just runs faster, cooler, and cheaper. Outside gaming it gets a bit weird, but actually favors A series. The 310s are *very* good at media encoding for the price. The A770 can also outperform the B series in some non gaming tasks (generally its inferior, but it can get 4gb more vram and has a wider bus, which can make it better, or sometimes close enough that it being older and thus cheaper can make up the difference.) For gaming, B series is strictly better",Positive
Intel,The b580 is close to the a750 in performance. Not worth buying that. The a770 is better but I wouldn’t recommend them now with the amd 9060xt out.,Negative
Intel,"The median net worth in the US is 200k and the US accounts for more of Nvidia’s revenue than the rest of the world. Speak for yourself, big bro.   Regardless, what even prompted you to say this? I’m just answering OP’s question about Intel’s popularity lmao",Neutral
Intel,Totally fine.,Positive
Intel,"Given you dont need to run DDU or (in some cases) do a fresh install of Windows to get the cards to run decently id argue theyre pretty well refined.   Even compared to AMDs drivers Nvidias just tend to work without much effort, from what ive been seeing it sounds like bf6 has had a ton of issues regardless of which gpu youve got. Having a set of rough updates off the back of 20+ years of development doesnt discount the amount of time theyve had to work on getting things working well. Intels 1st dgpus came out in 2022 IIRC",Neutral
Intel,Sure it can. You can get a 3070 at the cost or a 3070 Ti for a little more and it beats the B580.  I just sold my 3070 Ti for $290 a month ago because that's all people were willing to buy at. Some sold the card for even less.,Positive
Intel,"A used b580 is better price to performance, they’re just kinda speaking arbitrarily",Neutral
Intel,3070 or 3070 Ti. One may cost more. I sold my 3070 Ti for $290 and others are selling for less.,Neutral
Intel,"Wrong, the B580 outperforms the A770 in every case i know.",Negative
Intel,You’re comparing the used market to the new market. You can get a used B580 for $170 on ebay as the first listing I see.,Neutral
Intel,"Not arbitrary with my assumption they want to spend $250 on a new B580. I don't know for sure they wanted to go new, but in case it was their plan, I'm saying instead of spending $250 on a new one if that's what their plan is, just spend $250 on a used card which will have better performance. It's really common sensical as to what I am saying. Don't understand what is arbitrary about that.",Neutral
Intel,"Wrong. The A770 has more VRAM and works better for AI/ML workloads.  That's why they're releasing other cards to help with loading models.    As for gaming performance, the A770 and B580 are very close in most benchmarks.  It's game dependent which one does better, but in scenarios more vram is needed the A770 wins.  12GB isn't terrible for 1080p/1440p workloads but it's just OK.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed, that was my intent and my assumption that OP was going to go for new. $250 spent on a used card is spent better than on a new B580.  I don't think this point is invalid to the point where it should be downvoted.",Neutral
Intel,"Ok… but if OP is willing to buy used cards, $170 is better spent on a used B580 than $250 on a 3070 as you can spend the extra $80 to get other components that are better as well",Neutral
Intel,"Sure this is true, but I was only talking about going for a brand new B580 versus a used GPU. I naturally assume at such a low price point that people will go brand new on that GPU rather than used.  You can argue different scenarios with a different good answer, but what you stated wasn't exactly relevant to my assumption.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, but your assumption is inherently flawed is all I’m pointing out.",Neutral
Intel,"No, my assumption isn't flawed when I had no evidence to suggest that OP was going used on that card. How can I possibly know what OP intends on doing without it having been explicitly stated? I would personally expect them to go for a new card and not used as the card is already cheap enough to get it new (without considering budget constraints, but they also never stated any details on a budget and other essential info).   Hindsight and what comes after the comment was made is different, but my comment was based entirely on a very specific scenario. I think it's clear from my comment that I was specifically discussing differences between a new B580 and a different used card. I wasn't talking about anything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Your comment here already dismantles the scenario you thought of. You claimed you assumed they would be going for a new card. This assumption automatically means that going for a used card is out of the question, so comparing the new card to the used card doesn’t make sense. If OP were to be considering going used on cards, why would they not consider going used on the B580? The problem is that you didn’t think to expand the logic you presented beyond one specific card, which is inherently flawed.",Negative
Intel,For what purpose? Because if gaming is your goal this is not the play unless you’re refusing both AMD and Nvidia graphics for ideological reasons.,Negative
Intel,"So my goal is to get you to a RTX 5070 which requires $280 of reallocation.  - Downgrade the CPU to a 9600X. $160 saved  - You have three M.2 slots on your motherboard, you don’t need 4TB to start. Drop to 2TB $130 saved.  - Replace the Arc with an RTX 5070  Alternatively you can make a less severe CPU cut with the 7700X ($60 saved) and get the other $100 from your peripheral budget because frankly you don’t need $500 for all that. You could also downgrade the case to something with less fancy rgb (Montech XR, Phanteks XT View) but I understand some folks are very passionate with their case selection.",Neutral

I feel like the supplier in your area is jacking up the prices since it is difficult to find them.  I asked a friend of mine who does business hardware deals. He couldn't even get a quote.

Waiting on 5070Ti super - 24GB card with almost 1TBps VRAM bandwidth.",Positive
Intel,24GB VRAM for 500$ sounds super nice and not offered by any other GPU manufacturer. Plus they advertised a card with dual B60s (48GB VRAM total) sharing one PCI-E x16 slot (x8 each).,Positive
Intel,"I went down a similar route and ended up with a 5090. Less RAM than the Maxsun card, but the performance is insane.",Positive

Intel,You have a very narrow vision of speed. What you are saying is like your truck is faster than my audi because it has more horsepower. Nvidia is the top dog right now but that doesn't mean you get more from nvidia for 200$. VRAM size and speed is something you cannot ignore. If you have to load half of the model to system memory it is gonna decrease your speed significantly. And guess what? If you can't fit the model into your memory you won't be running it even if you have a billion cuda cores. This is why intel is offering 24GB VRAM for 500$ while you need to pay 2500$ for the same VRAM size in nvidia (rtx a5000 for example).,Negative
Intel,"But compared head to head with an nVidia or AMD/ATI of the same price and the Intel is not the top performer, last I checked.

Intel,"Driver support in games is very good these days, I have had considerably more issues on my NVIDIA PC than on my arc PC, over the last six months or so (I've also used that one more but still felt like a worse overall experience in terms of gaming drivers). Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",Negative

If I'd buy a new card right now, I'd be torn apart between B580 or 9060 XT.   But my main goal was/is a decent gaming experience with a  reasonable power consumption. I don't have a problem to fine tune settings to get stable 60 FPS and a flatline frametime. And it was a decision against NVIDIA, against their dominant position, which they exploit and hurt the market.",Positive
Intel,It has bad driver overhead and isn't great for now end systems.  It also doesn't have that great price to performance now that both AMD and Nvidia have released newer gpus.  I would take the 5060 over it at 1080p.  Far less driver overhead for Nvidia.  Dlss 4 is far better than xess,Negative
Intel,"To some degree, yes. But don't expect amazing energy efficiency with the card, its somehow the same performance as the RTX4060, but is 190 watts. Even if the 12GBs of VRAM makes it suitable for 1440p gaming",Neutral
Intel,"While I’m sure you want to take advice from someone with that username all day, yes it’s a good card.

I even got it for just a little over MSRP in my area, so yeah it feels worth every penny.",Positive
Intel,its a 1440p card wdym,Neutral
Intel,"Looking at benchmarks, it is really quite underwhelming compared to my old 3070 Ti (which I just sold for $295), which was enough to do 1440p at 144FPS at medium settings. It's definitely not a 1440p card that's going to give you high fps on modern titles. imo a proper 1440p card would be more like a card like a 5070 Ti which can actually do 1440p 144+ fps at highest settings, but 1440p and above with highest settings aren't really budget territory. You'll find that a majority of PC gamers are still playing at 1080p because 1440p isn't offering a great experience on cards lower than a 3070. And I would do the same myself if I had such a low end card.",Negative
Intel,"The 3070ti is a good card, but not that high in performance. Also that card WAS a 1440p capable card, now it can't go any higher than 1080p due to a lack of VRAM, not unless you had that rare 16GB version (which only a few were made)  The B580 can still very much do 1440p 60fps ultra quality, since ultra quality in games is more suited for 1440p compared to maximum settings",Neutral
Intel,"Most tasks in 3D/CG/VFX are predominantly single threaded, until you simulate (not always), render or export something when more multithreaded performance is nice to have available. A 7600 has solid single core performance and in day to day performance will be great.  2x8GB is a mistake though, at least get 2x16GB - preferably 6000cl30 (cl32 and cl36 are fine if the price difference is big). You can save on the cooler for now, use the stock one (comes with a 7600) until she has enough saved for an upgrade.  The Intel Arc A750 is certainly a contentious choice. The only reason I'd go arc at that price point is if she'll be doing a lot of high res video editing, otherwise I'd look at alternatives, possibly second hand. A 3060 12GB would be a nice to have for 3D as NVidia is completely dominant in that space, but you'd probably need some second hand luck; I find them for around 200 EUR in the Netherlands. It'll perform a bit better than the A750 in gaming too, and has way better software support.  You can always save on the case and may be able to shave off a bit going for an mATX board, though less than 140 EUR for a wifi one is unlikely.",Positive
Intel,"All parts look good but something to consider is some software just runs better on nvidia than others. I know this is true with video editing so maybe look at any applications she’ll need to run and see how the performance is before going with the intel card.   This is as good as I could manage being 100 over budget assuming the applications for vfx, cgi etc would play nicer with an nvidia card but don’t know for certain.

Intel,9060 XT is just like 10% better. Stay with the B580 until 2027,Positive
Intel,9060xt is prolly faster but for the price/p b580 prolly is the best rn  if u have the b580 then just stick with it until the next intel card like celestials or something unless ur running into issues with ur games i guess,Positive
Intel,I have the Steel Legend B580 and Ive had corruption and cold crashes with Hitman 3 and the latest drivers removed my optimizations as the features were gone!  So it has been frustrating if not annoying however it makes me sad to get rid of it like the others say when it works nice thats nice.  I'm calling the B580 a hassle but its not junk its simply not getting top tier support for layered driver support.   Bought the Sapphire Pulse 9060XT OC 16Gb and it matches is little siblin' the 6600XT OC i still use on my second PC.  Hitman 3 for me went from 127 FPS down to at least 60 fps with the former Tessellation off.  The Radeon is everything the B580 promises actually.  The AI cores on the B580 were interesting. I lost about $30 in the mix but Ive had the B580 all Summer.  Sad,Negative
Intel,"I saw you bought the b580. Considering it, can you tell me how it's doing so far? Any issues with any games?",Negative
Intel,I wouldn’t fidget if I already had B580 coming in. It’s got 12GB of VRAM and quite a bit cheaper than 9060XT 16GB and not that much worse of a performance. Especially if you’re planning big upgrade in 2027,Positive
Intel,Is the 8gb version still better than the b580?,Neutral
Intel,"If you are not having any issues, then why change? The B580 is a pretty good card (I recommend watching LinusTechTips video on it, 2 people changed their 4090s or high end cards and used ARC for some time). Plus, its performance is just getting better wich each driver update, and more games are adapting XeSS faster than FSR (lol).",Positive
Intel,"okey thanks for the suggestion, good day mate!",Positive
Intel,"Daniel Owen did a comparison and it's like 30% or more difference between the two, not 10%, so imho if he can, just get 9060xt 16gb, he get 30% better performance with more vram for 40% more cost if we use MSRP pricing for both, but yeah if he choose to get B580 now then there's no point in upgrading to 9060xt, 30% is hardly a worthwhile upgrade, and B580 already has enough vram at least until next gen console arrived",Neutral
Intel,..and if you haven't made the buy yet the extra $70 is well worth it. Likely $85 difference.  Count the extras. This thing trades hit with a 5060 Ti and the B580 somewhere well under and can perform nice (not missing much)  for you there for the $ but the hassle!,Positive
Intel,"well I had no problems so far, I played quite a few games so far already, never had an issue",Positive
Intel,Its pretty weak with tarkov and stalker 2 other games run well,Positive
Intel,Idk but I think 8gb version is worthy,Neutral
Intel,"Sounds like I made a good deal. Actually, I am yet to experiment with the Arc card, as I am getting the card today. Can you tell me what should be the ideal way to test the new card and what should be the ideal temps while gaming? (ASRock B580 Steel Legend 3 fan) I got",Positive
Intel,Actually purchased b580,Neutral
Intel,..B580 had it all on paper.  B580 CAN play ball but will it today ....  Doesn't deliver well enough for your money.  First game that is annoying you will be doing what I did.  Its pretty nice at $250 MSRP only as others declare simply because of the cheap feature set. Should have performed around the $350 mark and we all expected it to but a long time ago.  This is where the Enthusiast market was excited.  $369 Sapphire Pulse 9060Xt OC 16Gb is about as good as it gets right now.  Then again I drive a 2018 Dodge Challenger V6 AWD not the V8 HEMI.  lol  Two different franchises!,Negative
Intel,"Nice..i just bought one and tested it on BF2042 and it's incredibly better than my 1070ti. For such a low price, I'm happy.    I don't agree to pay ridiculously overpriced price for Nvidia stuff. They have a kind of Monopoly and allow themselves to squeeze everyone like lemons.. It's about time this change. Too bad if Intel cards are not as fancy. As long as they are not expensive and can run games decently well. I'll boycott Nvidia until they stop this madness. But when i see that people are crazy to accept 2000$ for a card, they really have no reasons to stop their scam!",Positive
Intel,"Actually any 8GB card isn't Worth it, the norm is 12GB and higher, I've noticed countless people running into problems of ""not enough VRAM"" and regret not getting the 16GB version of GPU's so they're stuck with lower graphical settings.",Negative
Intel,"I should not worry for temps, the B series improved efficiency... Just play your games, and actually, the B580 has better performance on 1440p. Not literally, rather than it performs better in higher resolutions.  And look into OC the safe way. Which is basically increasing power limits and adding boost, which makes the card to clock higher with same voltage, isn't dangerous.  And INSTALL ONLY WHQL DRIVERS. Basically this one's are like the Polished version of the first release. Like, they send v1, people download and test it (it's not a beta driver, is supposed to be stable), complain about issues and later they send v1 WHQL, which is like the 100% stable version.  I never had issues with any WHQL drivers. People that installed the newest (not WHQL) always have problems.. I suggest joining the Arc sub and ask any question you have.",Positive
Intel,12gb is more than enough for 1080p,Neutral
Intel,"you arent the sharpest tool in the shed are you mate, the B580 doesnt have cpu bottleneck issues, it just has compatibility issues with AM4, I run it with a 7600x so this guy with a 7700 wouldnt have the slightest of issues.",Negative

Intel,Mine was exactly 300. I like its AI cores.  It produces way better images than my 6600XT and noone but noone simply comments on overall image quality ..anyway I have hundreds of legal Steam games no cracked eh I also own the Epic games version.  See this damn card had a driver update while I had it that improves the performance and that's good its what we want but once the features drop and performance drops (for me anyway) after the next driver update I had to call it.  Its the poor driver software stack.  The hardware has serious potential!  A770 is maxed.  I see this B580 ownership  as I leased the card for the summer +$60.      Can you buy from the [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) USA website for our cost?? Shop our stores in the USA.   I should remind you the Steam cold crashes suck.  I have an Asus 850w Platinum for it and I know there's no power fail issue sooo its a goner.  Im old enough to say ive seen this before.  Dont hang out until its done right so long after its release.  Not a hot buy now imo.  There's the AsRock Challenger or the Sapphire Pule within $10 of each other. $359-369.

Intel,"So this is the Intel Arc B50. It's an *extremely* power limited BMG-G21 with only 16 Xe2 cores (B580 has 20) and only a 128 bit memory bus, limiting memory performance to just 224 GB/s: B580 has 456 GB/s.  To get power down to 70 watts and be slot powered, it has utterly castrated the BMG-G21. Only 4 MB L2 cache is enabled (of the 18 MB on the silicon) and it runs 1,000 MHz slower than it does in B580. Some sources claim 8 MB L2 is enabled, so this appears to be a bit unsure at the moment. It's not remotely B580's 18 MB and Intel's dGPU caching architecture is still a train wreck from its IGP origins.  What Intel has done is given it a similar memory config to AMD's 7600XT, 128 bit GDDR6 and 16 GB of it and cut the BMG-G21 down so far it can barely do anything. It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.  It could potentially be useful for AI, since Battlemage has strong INT8 performance, hobbyist level AI is all about CUDA and PyTorch. PyTorch will run on AMD fairly well, but Intel has pretty shit compatibility here and the card's performance will be inadequate for anyone wanting to play games on it.

Intel,"I die a little inside at all the people gauging this card by its gaming performance.  This card is the absolute perfect media server/homelab card.   It's cheaper new than a used a2000 12gb while having more VRAM, has enough VRAM to load somewhat decent local LLMs, has powerful AV1 encoding, and can handle more simultaneous streams than most people will need. All this while running on slot power, so it can go into most servers.  Are there cards that offer better performance? Sure, but I have no need for the extra headroom, and this card is a massive leap over the a50 that was just shy of being good enough imo.

Intel,"Even if it came with a side of fries, people would still grab that new nvidia GPU",Neutral
Intel,"So we can get a carbon copy of this gpu market but of the cpu market and even worse? Yeah, no thanks",Negative
Intel,"That would be unaliving themselves, CPUs are practically intel's only profitable sector, even tho on paper AMD is better in just about everything, in reality AMD struggles to actually ship enough volumes to regular customers to eat intel's share, intel still makes nearly 30 billion from the CPU business and mainly from laptops and pre-builts not from Data centers,they make nearly 3 times more than AMD does from CPUs.       Intel's problem is their Fabs which is a money black hole, but their CPUs are still doing well and making tons of profit, it's where the bulk of their revenue comes from.",Neutral
Intel,lmao,Neutral
Intel,Amd is just a buzzword for social media and content creators. Intel is and will always be better. Just got rid of my 3600x that people on this sub swore up and down about it being an upgrade and convinced me to get years ago. I went back to Intel and I couldn’t be happier. It’s night and day. No more micro stutters or restarting my pc because it randomly locks my entire system to 15 fps on boot!,Positive

Intel,It’s a well priced workstation gpu (rare),Positive
Intel,You may not need one.. but have you considered 4?  Affordable PCIe power-only 4x GPU workstation cluster babyyyyy,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it's a pro card it's not meant for gaming (although it can be used for that). At 350 the only redeeming factor for gaming is that it's slot powered and lp,Neutral
Intel,If you have a newer system... yes. There are a lot of reasons this is a bad choice for gaming regardless.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, by miles.  Answering for a friend.",Neutral
Intel,Exactly this.  Nothing drives innovation -or (relatively) drives DOWN prices- like genuine competition.,Negative

Intel,"For workstation/AI stuff? Yes.  For gaming? No, they are roughly equivalent.",Neutral
Intel,"Not a gaming card. Workstation card mostly for architects, engineers etc.   Decent value for what it is. I grabbed an arc a380 for video encoding and it’s phenomenal.",Positive
Intel,"Wait I’m confused. You said it can barely do anything, then that I will perform similarly to an RTX3060ti. That’s still a fairly capable card for AAA gaming, will it really perform that well on only 70w?",Neutral
Intel,"A lot of of LP slot powered cards won't beat the 3050 6GB. In fact, nothing in the gaming market. The A2000 does, but it was marketed as a workstation card as well. It's not the nothing burger you're making out to be. Granted, at $350, it's a stupid purchase to play games with when we have the 5060 LP.",Negative
Intel,Does it still have the same video functions as it's big brother? AV1 encoding and decoding would make this a decent plex/jellyfin card.,Neutral
Intel,"AI workload was my first thought as well, but I don’t think it will perform that well.   LLM are extremely bottlenecked by VRAM capacity and memory bandwidth. With the B50 having the abysmally slow 224GB/s, I wouldn’t expect anything impressive from it",Negative
Intel,"> It should perform around RTX 3060 Ti, RX 6600, RTX 2070 kind of level.  You do know the equivalent of the rtx 3060 ti are the RX 6700 XT and B580 right?  Well Arc B50 pro is significantly (~40%) slower than RX 6600 and Arc b570. Do with that information what you want.",Neutral
Intel,Pretty much just workstation,Neutral
Intel,"No, it has the full 18MB L2 and runs at 2600Mhz (250mhz lower than B580). Pytorch compatibility is fairly good.",Positive
Intel,Still hoping to be able to get my hands on a Intel B60 for my server (LLM for home assistant and coding stuff in my freetime). But I highly doubt it.,Neutral
Intel,I hope it's stronger than 3050. It's got more silicon.   You get 272 mm^2 of tsmc 5nm vs the 3050s 200 mm^2 of Samsung 8nm,Positive
Intel,"You can do that on any integrated graphics of any relatively recent CPU. No need for a B50.  However, if you have multiple services that want access to a GPU, then the B50 could be a very good option.  The B50 has support for SR-IOV, which allow you to basically split the GPU to multiple VMs",Positive

Intel,Blackwell pro 2000 and 4000 sff beg to differ (those cost a fortune though),Neutral
Intel,"Yep, there's only a tiny overlap between those groups that would even consider it an option.  I would consider it myself for my media server, do we know if it can do transcoding and what codecs/how many streams?",Neutral
Intel,"If somebody wants a 5080-level card, NVIDIA is the only company making cards for said somebody. AMD/Intel cards can come with all sorts of fries but if the performance isn't there, a good portion of the consumers won't even bother checking them.",Neutral
Intel,"When AMD or Intel actually delivers better products, that might change.   Nvidia still seems to be comfortably in the lead on technology advancements and product performance.",Positive
Intel,"Why wouldn't they? The software side of Nvidia is great, they've got everyone beat handily and in many parts of the world, equivalent AMD or Intel cards aren't substantially cheaper due to regional pricing and local taxes.",Positive
Intel,"sad but true, I just thought if Intel is struggling atm why not focus on the thing that they're doing well in.",Negative
Intel,That’s what people said about AMD when they first released Ryzen,Neutral
Intel,"nah I'd be down for some fries. I get a ""new"" card every year or so and swap out the oldest/lowest performance card in my machines.   Currently have a 7800xt, and a few 2080's.  Have a stack with older stuff like the 1050ti and rx 480, and a 3060",Neutral
Intel,"I laughed, despite myself.  Now my boss is looking at me weird.",Negative
Intel,"Great for what it is, hopefully even better as new product prices wear off and more deals start to show up.

Intel,It's definitely not made for gaming both in value and performance but it's still gameable if happen to steal one from intel headquarters,Negative
Intel,"If you look up vids testing its performance in gaming it’s way better than a 1050ti, what are you talking about? It’s about the same performance as a rx6600 or rtx 2070",Positive
Intel,"Wait, so how is it different from high-end Iris Xe integrated GPUs, then?",Neutral
Intel,"A lot of people bought the A2000 to play games, because there weren't a lot of LP options at the time. The best was the 1650, and the A2000 was substantially faster. However, that is not the case anymore.",Neutral
Intel,"If you're running the likes of Bentley MicroStation or Autodesk Civil3D (some of the apps I look after at work) on this little thing, you're taking your workstation back to IT, telling them to ram that little toy up their arses, and to get you a real workstation.  Engineering and architecture workstations are about rasterisation performance. The designs and drawings have to be rendered quickly and smoothly on your two 4K monitors, which a stripped back and power-throttled 70 watt BMG-G21 isn't going to do.  For very entry level visualisation, we use RX 7600XTs with 16 GB, they have AutoDesk and Bentley certified drivers and enough VRAM and rasterisation to handle it. The RTX 4060 Ti isn't that bad there either, again you need the 16 GB version. On the next refresh of the low end workstations, they're probably going to end up being 9060XT and 5060Tis. Both of those would smash this little thing silly.  To that, I'm not sure who Intel wants to sell this to. $350 isn't serious money and it's competing with gaming-intended GPUs (which are utterly fine for visualisation and design) of much higher performance. It doesn't have substantially more RAM than competing products, it doesn't ECC protect the RAM and workstations generally don't care for slot powered cards either way. The ones we use come as standard with 800 watt PSUs and our choice of ""gaming"" CPUs like Ryzens or Cores, or Threadrippers and Xeons - Xeons are a bit less popular these days.  I'm seeing only an argument here for it being a solid SFF video card. It's the most powerful thing you can run in a 75 watt slot power budget... ~~but it isn't half-height.~~  [Yes it is.](https://www.servethehome.com/intel-arc-pro-b50-review-a-16gb-sff-mini-gpu/) So yeah, a solid SFF card.  Intel's inability to execute on the CPU side may be bleeding over to the GPU side and that would be very tragic.",Neutral
Intel,But also he is bullshitting.  No it won't perform that well in gaming.  It won't perform anywhere near the rtx 3060 ti. B580 has somewhat similar performanc to rtx 3060 ti.  While the arc pro b50 is around 40% slower than the **Arc B570**  Which is still considered impressive because is a Pcie only card. But budget wise it is trash value,Negative
Intel,"~~From what I can tell here, B50 isn't even LP.~~  Strike that. [It is.](https://www.servethehome.com/intel-arc-pro-b50-review-a-16gb-sff-mini-gpu/)",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, it's great for that",Positive
Intel,"If the B60 wasnt going to require an external power connector, I'd be hyped for it, but unfortunately I need slot power in my system. Its looking to be really impressive for LLM applications though. Excited to see what people can do with it.",Positive
Intel,True. It's better than the A1000 for productivity. I guess you're right. Better than the 3050. Maybe on par with the B570?,Positive
Intel,I was indeed wrong. Didn’t even hear about a new one being released.,Negative
Intel,"The answer is kind of long, but most ARM chips (probably all) can’t emulate/simulate x86, however there is lots of software that does this. Under Windows it has kernel-level ARM to x86/64 translation for Windows binaries. Compatibility is pretty decent but it’s hard to tell under gaming since there’s no GPU drivers for anything but embedded ARM graphics.  Under Linux, it’s a totally different story. You have Box64 and FEX-EMU. I switched to all ARM years ago but it came with a learning curve. Compared to three years ago, there’s many high performance games and performance reaches about 50-70% of native x86 performance.  If you wanna see some games running on ARM you can check out some videos I made almost 3 years ago below. I cover native ARM games, ARM games running under Box64, games running under Box64/Wine, and games running under Box64 and Steam Proton.  I really should make more videos going over the pros, cons and evolution/reality of the landscape… Anyways!  https://youtu.be/OQrDQmONm6s?si=mDm-hcw1BeNeVLUK",Neutral

Intel,And neither are on the market yet.,Neutral
Intel,Intel GPUs have VERY good media performance. I believe they support basically all modern codecs,Positive
Intel,True for high end like you mention but the best selling cards are usually the mid rangers and there is competition there.,Neutral
Intel,Not even 1% of the world can afford these lol so who cares.,Negative
Intel,*laughs in my AMD GPU connectors that don't melt*,Negative
Intel,"Wrong. 9070 XT is better and cheaper than 5070 Ti but the Reddi-sphere refuses to acknowledge it, all claiming that ""unless the 9070 XT is at least 50 dollars cheaper, buy the 5070 Ti"" bunch of sheep",Negative
Intel,"For me the Intel arc B580 costs slightly more than a 3060(or a used 3060 Ti), while performing like a 3060 Ti. I only looked at the gamer side of things, the b580 can probably do local AI and media editing better than both cards. The other alternatives at this price are the Radeon 9060XT 8GB(VRAM'nt), the 5060(which gets it's ass handed to it by the 3060 ti) and maybe a used 2080 Ti",Neutral

Intel,Someday you roo shall participate in the mundane arguments.,Neutral
Intel,Give or take a month or two,Neutral
Intel,Best on market actually,Positive
Intel,"Up until one year ago, NVIDIA also had near no competition in ray tracing, AMD cards just performed very poorly in that regard.  If I had to choose between two cards that are almost identical but one lets me enable ray tracing without losing half the fps, I'd rather have this option than a couple more fps in general.",Negative
Intel,"Talk about best selling, let's not forget about the laptop market which is much bigger that the desktop, Intel doesn't have anything serious there, AMD has some dGPUs but good luck ever buying a laptop with one outside the US, your only option is really Nvidia. Hell, even a decent AMD APU is hard to come buy and for the same price you get a much stronger laptop with an RTX.",Neutral
Intel,Hehe! Good one! Since 2013 I have only had troubles with 2 GPUs. Both AMD. I have during the same time had 3x Nvidia GPU and none has malfunctioned once.   My experience may of course deviate from the norm. But from my perspective Nvidia has delivered where AMD has not.  Perhaps I’ll try AMD again next time.,Positive
Intel,"Reddit is a circle jerk of AMD fanboys, the fuck are you talking about?  You’d think AMD has a 50% GPU market share if you just looked at this sub.",Negative
Intel,"You seem to be incorrect.   https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-RTX-5070-Ti-vs-AMD-RX-9070-XT/4181vsm2395341  Luckily there are actual benchmarks to refer to.

But for a price difference like that, I could be convinced that the performance per cost is better. Not the overall performance.  Edit2* I’d be thrilled to get an explanation as to why stating sources of benchmarks yields downvotes. Bad sources? Wrong interpretations? Fanboyism?",Negative
Intel,"b60, the beefier workstation gpu they announced, might interest you whenever they officially release specs and prices then. Supposedly 24GB model and a 48GB model that's basically two combined on one board for what will hopefully be very competitive prices in the space as well.",Positive
Intel,"B50 is on the level of like a 1050. It has nothing to do with gaming lmao.   Ada 4000 cost like $1500 for 4060ti performance.   Ada 2000 cost like $1000 for even worse than that.   For sff you are better off getting a sff gaming card, it will be cheaper and perform better.",Negative
Intel,Not a soul wants this for gaming unless they're using it for other work and then exceptionally light gaming on the side,Negative
Intel,I'm gonna be honest. I'm probably a bit of an outlier. If I see an RT option in a game I Usually turn it off and I've been doing that since the 2080ti. But yeah of they have cost the same and one has way better RT it's a simple choice.,Neutral

Intel,I’ll have to look into that,Neutral
Intel,"What? It's the opposite of what you think it is.  Having to build games without ray tracing is what takes actual development time, ray tracing being realtime means all developers need to do is… add objects to the world. No ray tracing means you have to bake the lighting into objects, which requires calculations and therefore development time every single time an object position is changed.  If a studio has an in-house engine, they'll have to implement it, yes, but it can be done in parallel by the people who work on the engine and not on the game. Unreal Engine has it baked in and enabled by default, though it prompts every time for shadows compilation in case of ray tracing turned off.",Negative

Given its requirement for 4K60 at ""Ultra"" is just 12 GB VRAM, this probably isn't a hugely intensive game.  All that said, however, this is likely a mistake. The B580 is already in the 1440p 60 boxes and it isn't keeping up with an RX 9070 or the RTX 5070 alternative.  What's weirder than this are the CPU requirements. The 7950X3D (Ultra) is **slower** than the 7800X3D (High) unless the game is using utterly silly numbers of threads. The ""Minimum"" Ryzen 7 5800F isn't even a real thing!

Captured in a CPU heavy area that they use in all their CPU & GPU testing. You can easily see the differences between CPUs. Even my 9800x3D is CPU often limited in many ways. Not so much when playing with locked 120Hz, but definitely when going any higher.   Edit. One addition. When using high GPU intensive path tracing, it will also tank the CPU performance. Something that actually got my mind blowed when I tested this on my 5800x3D & 9800x3D.

I’m sure there is many settings that don’t change fidelity a lot but eat up fps, so putting some to low and some to high may be a better experience. This also seems pretty damn general of a spec sheet here, almost like it’s useless based on some things here.   Throw on dlss with the 3070 ti and enjoy probably like 80 fps.  It does seem to be a gorgeous looking game too.   However, I’m not trying to defend it, and I would expect it to be optimized for the money that they’re asking. Like any game these days.

Intel,60 fps target with raster performance is a very sensible target.,Positive
Intel,and in 4K,Neutral
Intel,I don't mind if they recommend frame gen for something more logical like 120+ fps where the latency won't be super horrible. But requiring frame gen just to get 60 fps means the experience is going to suck. I'd rather play at 30 fps than with the weird feeling latency that frame gen causes when working with a low starting frame rate.,Negative
Intel,It still is the input latency of 25fps,Neutral
Intel,"With cheese Mr Squidward, with cheese.",Neutral
Intel,"No it’s a perfectly valid thing to point out, there is a massive difference between 4k 60 and 4k 60 with frame generation.   This is coming from someone who generally enjoys frame generation, but what has allowed me to enjoy it is knowing how to use it properly, and going from sub 60fps up to 60 is not the right way to use frame generation.",Neutral
Intel,fuck the devs,Negative
Intel,"If it's not a mistake, maybe frame gen and upscaling make it technically possible, but with unbearable latency.",Negative
Intel,"I was being ironic. Every UE5 game I’ve played needed upscaling to hit 60+ fps, e.g. MGS3 Delta, Oblivion Remastered, KCD 2 (real good game). But that's just me being annoying, wanting everything on ultra.",Negative
Intel,"yeah ""intel sponsored game"" but Arc A750 that is 87% faster than the 5500XT/1060 is for 1080p low 30fps, and that argument is dead. B580 doesn't have enough power to play at 4k, the difference between B580 and 5070/9070 is so massive it won't matter anyway that it's better optimized for battlemage architecture.

Intel,Multithreaded optimizations are notoriously difficult for most developers. I doubt this game needs that much throughput.,Negative
Intel,9950X3D is notably an exception to the rule. The 7950X3D was and is slower than the 7800X3D.,Neutral
Intel,"Emmm the game looks just like DL2, and that gpu maxed out the game easily, so why now barely 60 at medium?  crap optimization",Negative
Intel,"But as we're told by Jensen, AI runs on the (Nvidia) GPU, right?",Neutral
Intel,It's with the Ray Tracing ON that's why it requires frame gen especially on Ultra 4K. Stop rushing and read more carefully.,Neutral
Intel,... The B580 definetley has 12GB of Vram wdym.,Neutral
Intel,If they implement every single optimiztaion intel recommends then its more than possible to get 4K 60K on the B580 with FG.,Neutral
Intel,"Ah, I guess it's not out of the realms of possibility these days anyway 😂  Yeah UE5 is the worst. I've not *had* to use upscaling on my 9070 XT at 1440p ultra for a playable experience but since I prefer a higher refresh rate experience then I've usually had it stick it on to quality to get that experience when other games/engines I can easily play native and do that.  The newest version of XeSS is decent if you're on RDNA 3.",Negative
Intel,"To be fair, Bf6 is particularly CPU heavy. My wife's 5600x was at 100% usage the entire time the game was open. My 9950x3d would be as high as 60% avg on one or 2 maps",Neutral
Intel,"No, it is still active! The problem with the 7950x3D (and 5950x3D) is that some processes can go to the part without the 3D-Vcache. So you could say the problem is that it isn't turned off, or rather that the scheduler doesn't prioritise correctly.",Negative
Intel,Not if you bother spending 10 seconds properly configuring your $900 CPU.,Neutral
Intel,You can literally just turn off CCD1 on the 7950X3D and it'll run as a slightly upgraded 7800X3D. Proper CPPC and Process LASSO configuration will make it always run better or the same.,Positive
Intel,I got like 85 fps in ultrawide with a mixed/ ultra settings. What are you talking about?,Negative
Intel,Why are you assuming I didn’t know it was with RT on?,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is that FG is a “win more” tool. You don’t use FG for sub 60 to get to 60, as it has poor latency. Generally not a good experience.",Negative
Intel,"The issue is I’m expecting 4K Ultra out of a 1440p card; as I game at 5120x1440, about 20% shy of 4K.      But honestly, I don’t care that much, I’ve played games at 40/45 and still had fun with awesome graphics. I just need stability.",Negative
Intel,My 5070 was bottlenecked by my 5700x3d in bf6,Neutral
Intel,"I throttled my cpu and had no dips in performance, temps went back down to 60ish. I don’t think they were utilizing the cores correctly or something.",Negative

Intel,Wow sounds like a great deal for hundreds more lol,Positive
Intel,"but you have a 5070 not a 6750xt/3070ti..................................   Edit: also, barely 80fps on a 5070 on and old gen game is HORRIBLE",Negative
Intel,Man do you even realize how demanding the RT is? they put a 5070 there not a 5090.,Negative
Intel,"Makes sense, my 7800xt was about right with my 5700x3d. There was no bottleneck since all my components were fully utilised",Neutral
Intel,"If money isn't an issue, yeah actually. It's at parity or slightly better in gaming with massive headroom, and completely shreds it in productivity.",Negative
Intel,That’s what I got with my 3070ti and 5600x. I just recently upgraded. I get far more fps now on max settings with raytracing.,Positive
Intel,"Yes, I use RT often so I know how heavy it is, in fact I used it in the DL2 base game, but that’s neither here nor there when it comes to my point.   They really shouldn’t be labelling it as 4k 60 if they are using frame generation to get there. Nobody will realistically want to used FG to get from sub 60fps up to 60, so they should have just put 4k 30fps in that category.",Neutral
Intel,"You won't need frame gen to hit 60 if you have a current gen card like 5080.   5070 has the performance of a 3080ti or 4070ti, both cards for 2K nowadays. Look at it as a sign of good optimization for those that have 4K monitors.  I also don't use FG, but the graphic looks better rather than slapping 5080 there to brute force it.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah I’m aware of all of that, but again it’s not really my point, my point is that they really shouldn’t be marking it up at 4k 60 for those cards, probably in the hopes that a lot of people will just skim over it and not see the bit further down in brackets that you actually need to use frame generation to achieve that with those cards.   It’s misleading at best, as those cards won’t get near 60 fps with those settings without it, and it’s not the way FG is supposed to be used, it would be an awful experience, they either should have listed the actual cards you will need to get 4k 60 with those settings, or marked that category as 4k 30fps.",Negative
Intel,you're probably CPU bottlenecked though the slow RAM isn't helping you at all either. Get a 2x16 3600 speed RAM kit and/or grab a 5000 series AMD CPU,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, you're probably being hit by the driver overhead issues. You want at least a 5000-series Ryzen to mitigate that, as the other commenter suggested.",Negative

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Neutral
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative

I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Negative

After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..

Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,"Oh wow, this is probably the first time I'm seeing dual channel listed in the RAM section of specs requirements.",Neutral
Intel,im more baffled as to why they are comparing a RX 5700 to a GTX 1070. Id have thought they would have said a RX 590 (instead of 5700) or RTX 2060 (instead of 1070),Negative
Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,This gives me hope that Star Wars outlaws will also have FSR 3. 🤌,Positive
Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Negative

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Neutral
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative
Intel,Recently upgraded GPU and CPU and crazy that newer games are already requiring the newest GPUs to play them. Personally I don't think it's a horrible thing but at the same time it just screams horrible optimization.,Negative
Intel,This game better look like real life with those specs. I does looks beautiful!,Positive
Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative
Intel,Damn. My 5700XT did Mirage fine on Medium/Low shadows. Now its basement quality.,Positive

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,"Likely includes the RT features , its also 4k",Neutral

Intel,Exactly! It even got xess so Intel users also can use xess,Positive
Intel,">Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. T  its not much different for consoles , like alan wake 2 uses Low to mid settings and FSR balanced on PS5 even on switch titles use scaling and no man sky even FSR and stuff.",Negative
Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative

Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative

So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Neutral
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,Pretty much yeah... Was inevitable that Devs will use up scaling as excuse.  Same for taa being a absolute shoddy aaatleast up scalers do better aa :/ . But even consoles run now heavy fsr like the PS5 uses fsr balanced on WLAN wake on mostly low settings,Negative
Intel,We don't know the settings.  If its like cyberpunk psycho rt on release which 3080 and 3090 easily needed dlss balanced or performance for on 1440p and 4k...    Then I can see the same case in this game for 4080 and similar cards  Also they dont speak about frame gen just fsr2 ( which doesn't exist here because they support fsr3 which does up scaling and frame gen it's not split like dlss 2 & 3),Neutral

Intel,"Really comes up to how far the rt and lumen stuff can be pushed, if it goes to cyberpunk psycho rt levels? At release it needed a 3080 and 3090 with dlss.   So it could need top end gpu of this gen if its a similar case",Neutral
Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.  They got anyway already confused with fsr3 and fsr2 ( cause 3 is fsr frame gen and up scaling it's not like dlss where 2 is up scaling and 3 is frame gen)",Negative
Intel,Very similar performance I guess,Neutral
Intel,Ye,Neutral
Intel,They've been using it since forever. The difference is that PC GPUs were 10x faster than console GPUs so there was no need for it on PC.,Neutral

Intel,Honestly... Maybe fsr3 frame gen can help you but... A 3300 Was already outdated when it came out.,Negative
Intel,Most likely the upgrade part called FSR 2 and the frame creation part called FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,If they didnt get confused between FSR 3 and 2 then yes fsr 3 roughly doubles fps same for AFMF.,Neutral

Intel,"with AFMF it works , didnt test with FSR3 now.",Neutral
Intel,Reading before raging :),Neutral
Intel,"It is even low quality with 30fps and still needs 5700 ~~XT~~. That is pretty bad :D  *Corrected to 5700, which I think is still a lot for FSR2 at low fullHD, but definitely cheaper GPU.",Negative

Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Positive
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Negative
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral

Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Neutral

Intel,"> Who actually plays games at native these days, if it has upscaling?  I do.",Neutral
Intel,"I won't judge your preferences, but at least using native rendenring isnt the clown show we have here. Native 4k look the same no matter what gpu render it (performances aside). Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.  RT is the future because there are scenarios that rasterized rendering is just not capable of resolving. Screen space reflection artifacts, light leaking, weird glow on indirectly lit models... I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Neutral
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative
Intel,Or the game performs at 50 fps at 1080p low on 5700 but 50fps is a weird number to target and they can't say 60 so they just say 30fps and call it a day.,Negative
Intel,Not if it's using mesh shaders like Alan wake. In that game the GTX 1650 outperforms the 1080ti.,Neutral
Intel,The game is raytracing only with a ridiculous ammount of foooliage.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm so glad this is finally getting more main stream spotlight.

Intel,Honestly my 1070 still runs great for what it is. It’s in my sons rig now because it couldn’t keep up with 1440p depending on the game and definitely not 4k. Still a fairly solid 1080p card.,Positive
Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Negative
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral
Intel,Spoken like someone who has never upscaled 1080p content on a 1440 screen. The pixel ratios are all off. It's fucked.  1440p is perfect for watching old 720p HD content though.,Negative
Intel,Completely agree.,Neutral
Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral

Intel,">I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.  Facepalm...  Avatar Frontiers of Pandora very literally uses a custom engine, not Unreal Engine.",Neutral
Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,"Next gen seems promising so far, low native rez hidden by upscaling, 60 FPS target on +500$ GPUs, traversal stuttering thanks to the glorious UE5. But hey, we have great reflections on puddles so at least we can take good looking screenshots.",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.

Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative

Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game.

Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive
Intel,AMD just released drivers for Alan Wake 2 that fixed the flickering while using FSR.,Neutral
Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, wow. I didn't know that. But it'll likely be on a similar level as UE5, right?",Neutral
Intel,Next gen DOES NOT MEAN that your CURRENT GEN hardware can run it well for sure... Why don't people get that?,Negative
Intel,That reminds me to grab moss 1 and 2. I just got a quest 3.   Agreed though. I’ve been waiting for kingdom hearts 3 to come to steam for so long that I’m basically going to skip it at this point. It’s still stuck on the epic game store.,Neutral
Intel,Far cry 6 and re4 are older and or lower demanding games.  And yes any Mode here does either Hardware or Software rt from. Min to max.,Neutral
Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral

So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Negative
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Neutral
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.  Let's daisy chain 4 4090s ..gets 60 fps.. and then house goes on fire!  Obviously I'm being sarcastic but realistically it's actually pretty sad a 4090 20 frames per second.",Negative

But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG.

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral

Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Negative
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Negative
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware accelerated physics (as in on the gpu), is different than what's going on the CPU.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah. People with Windows 7 were using AMD to play the game with old Nvidia card for Physx. Nvidia didn't like that and blocked it via driver,Negative
Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Positive
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Neutral
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Negative
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Neutral
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative
Intel,AW2 looks insane. Can't wait to play soon,Positive
Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is. You can't beat caching and prepping the data near the oven. Can't cook a thousand buns in an industrial oven at the same time if there's trucks with 100 coming only once an hour.",Negative
Intel,My 3080 in shambles,Neutral
Intel,"It looks better than native even with fsr quality, the Taa in this game is shit",Negative
Intel,You dont need to increase raw performance. You need to increase RT performance.,Neutral
Intel,Imagine!,Neutral
Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Neutral
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, sure, now go back to play starfield.",Neutral
Intel,"There literally is a /s, what else do you need to detect sarcasm?",Neutral
Intel,"Someone made a really cool comment yesterdays on Reddit that even a generated frame using path tracing is less fake than a rasterized frame. It is effectively closer to reference truth. I had never thought about it that way, but people really are clutching their pearls with this shit",Positive
Intel,"I know, which makes path tracing even worse off imo.",Negative

Intel,haha this is gold 🥇,Neutral
Intel,"At the moment, it’s definitely what it seems like.  Especially seeing how there’s only one card on the planet that can run this. Do you have a 4090?",Neutral
Intel,">I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage.  Not at all, in fact another AAA game with ""path tracing"" is coming out next month.  >The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native  Forget ""native"", that ship has already sailed. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are all working on machine learning techniques, and several game developers are starting to optimize their games around DLSS/FSR.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, not even close.  Shaders 3.0 - that's improvement. Ray tracing is noticeable, but nowhere near to justify the hit.  I've looked techpowerup comparison RT vs LOW (lol). Low looked far better and cleaner, then blurry mess of RT (Overdrive).   I don't need ""realistic"" lighting, I need pleasent bisual part with good gameplay. For ghraphics I have a window in my appartment.",Neutral
Intel,"In a screenshot, sure. When actually playing the game, unless the fps is low enough to remind them, 99,99% of people will forget if they left it on or not.",Negative
Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative
Intel,Man you had to lap your q9300 to hit 3.0ghz? Those chips really weren't OC friendly.  My q6600 hummed along 3.2 no problem on 92mm arctic freezer and a slight voltage bump.  I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.,Positive
Intel,Funnily Crysis still have better destructible environments than Cyberpunk has tho,Positive
Intel,"This. People losing their shit either weren't around when Crysis launched or have forgotten just how demanding it was . PT CP kicks the shit out of a 4090, Crysis murdered my 8800ultra.",Negative
Intel,crysis did not do 1080p 60 on maximum setting and dx10 on a 8800GT.   I had a 1280*1024 monitor back then and barely had 30 fps with my 8800GT.   Even the 8800 Ultra did not do 60 fps on full hd.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=46j6fDkMq9I,Negative
Intel,"Man, I remember how hype the 8800gt was. Thing was a hell of a big jump compared to previous cards that came out, prolly our first REALLY powerful card.  Still remember the old xplay video where they build a PC to play crysis and Bioshock. Put 2 8800GTs in sli in there with a core 2 quad which costed one thousand dollars back then!",Positive
Intel,"My poor HD 4850 got pushed to the limit to give me 1280x1024, lol",Negative
Intel,I remember thinking $300-400 (IIRC) was so much for a GPU back around those days.  7800XT is the closest we've seen in a while and not even close to the top end for today.,Negative
Intel,This is still the case to this day because the game includes a really old DLL file for PhysX. The other day I followed the instructions on the PCGamingWiki to delete some DLL files in the game directory and only then it ran perfectly smooth on my RTX 3070.,Neutral
Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Positive
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens. Sadly an Nvidia GPU is still required if you want to turn PhysX effects on for games from that era, though I hear that it's possible again to use it with an AMD GPU as primary.",Negative
Intel,"OMG I had the exact same experience, hahaha I remember it vividly, I was so confused why that room would just destroy my FPS until I figured out PhysX was enabled LOL",Negative
Intel,"I'd like to see ray tracing addon cards, seems logical to me.",Neutral
Intel,"TBH, I could probably run some of the old games I have on CPU without the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Had the exact same experience. One scene in the whole game that actually used PhysX,Neutral
Intel,You could probably run Mirror's edge with physx on today's hardware without gpu fans turning on,Neutral
Intel,Last time I tried on an R7 1700X and RX580 I still couldn't turn on PhysiX without it being a stutter party 2 fps game.,Negative
Intel,What gpu you have,Neutral
Intel,Now it even runs fine on a Ryzen 2400G.,Positive
Intel,"And they were right, PhysX and systems very much like it are still used but things have advanced so much nobody even thinks about it and it no longer requires dedicated silicon.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, it’s been common knowledge for many years now that Nvidia are the most ruthlessly anti-consumer company in PC hardware, and it’s not particularly close.",Negative
Intel,Ah good old Ageia before nvidia bought them out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageia,Positive
Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative
Intel,Intel design will be a little bit different as far as now.  If I understood it right AMD chiplets communicate via lines on pcb but Intel wants to make something like chip-on-a-chip.,Neutral
Intel,bedroom ring library cows summer thought aspiring worm north joke   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
Intel,"It's also worth noting that those early movies don't use path tracing either, Pixar switched to PT with Monster University around 2013 IIRC.",Neutral
Intel,"There is a lot of room for improvement, both in the software and future generations of hardware.  It's coming along though!  Overdrive mode looks nice, but there's just a lot more ghosting than the regular RT mode.",Positive
Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative
Intel,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,Positive
Intel,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.

Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update.

I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock).

My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

Intel,Anyone who owns an Nvidia GPU should be ashamed of themselves tbh.,Negative
Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now.

It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

But maybe DLSS 3.6 will solve those.  I do feel DLSS itself has also improved in the past few years in terms of ghosting and performing at lower resolutions.  On a 1440p monitor these are the starting point resolutions:  - Quality: 1707x960p - Balance: 1485x835p - Performance: 1280x720p - Ultra Perf: 853x480p  So even the highest quality option is sub-1080p.

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,My point is if you've got nvidia card you simply use 3rd party soft and got everything and more. So comparing that AMD's software to Nvidia's is kind of meaningless.,Neutral
Intel,"I actually agree with you, but I don't need the metric to be some scientifically accurate reading of performance or whatnot, I just think it'd be a useful tool for adjusting game settings. For example, if I'm trying to optimize performance in a game, does this setting make CPU utilization go up or down? How much almost doesn't matter. Is there a bottleneck, where is it, and am I relieving pressure on it with these settings or not?",Neutral
Intel,It’s where you oc in adrenaline,Neutral
Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Negative
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Negative
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm aware that some settingd impact CPU usage, but I think looking at the CPU usage is about as useful as your daily horoscope, or AIDA64 memory benchmark",Neutral

Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral

What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

They aren't upgradable. And that 8GB of RAM is rough.

Same laws that intel has been consistently losing for decades?  >cheaper for AMD to pay from their own pocket to keep Intel afloat rather than let them go bankrupt.  That's not how anti trust/monopoly laws works. Company A going bankrupt because they kept shooting themselves in the foot doesn't mean that Company B automatically become subject to anti trust lawsuits. Nvidia isn't exactly paying AMD even when they hold 90-95% of the market. Legislative scrutiny tends to come from manipulative practices, not from just selling a better product.  Since you might bring it up, Microsoft propped up Apple because they wore forcing their own software through Windows, not because they were just simply selling Windows.

(Local Data Share stores wavefronts close to the CU's, it's scratchpad memory meaning that using it doesn't require a TLB access and address translation which makes sense as wavefronts can be streamed in from L2. This results in lower latency)    Combined with the rumor that AMD will get rid of the L3 infinity cache in favor of a much larger + lower latency L2 like Nvidia and Intel and RDNA5's cache hierarchy could look very similar to Nvidia or Intel's    **Intel did something similar**  Intel added dedicated L1 cache functionality to the 192kb of SLM to Alchemist (from Xe-LP or DG1) [Xe-LP didn't have an L1 cache like RDNA4]   Intel allocates 96kb to L1 and 160kb to SLM in the 256kb shared L1/SLM cache block in Battlemage.    **RDNA5 possible cache hierarchy**   32kb of L0i + 32kb of L0 Vector + 16kb of L0 Scalar cache (per cu)     192kb or 256kb of L1/SLM per WGP (Similar to Nvidia/Intel)   32mb L2 (Big and lower latency L2 block like Nvidia/Intel)",Neutral

AMD,"""Radeon"" and ""discrete mobile GPUs"" are two concepts that really don't mix all that well.    AMD has historically been either unwilling or unable to invest in creating the kinds of engineering solutions needed to make product integration easier for laptop OEMs, nor have they been able to guarantee adequate levels of supply to any real extent.  The same can be said for their mobile APUs as well, but the scale of the problem is an order of magnitude worse for their discrete GPUs.",Negative
AMD,"One out of three. Yep interesting and overlooked. I also wondered why I couldn't find L1 cache numbers for RDNA4 anywhere but in hindsight it's obvious.  L1 is per Shader Array (half WGP partition of a Shader Engine) not WGP.  L2 cache redesign is more aimed towards negating the 384 -> 256 bit MC config from 7900 XTX -> 9070 XT. 9070 XT Infinity cache is so fast that the effective BW is actually higher than 7900 XTX's despite -33% lower mem BW.  Oh for sure. The L1 was never a good design. Probably tons of cache thrashing due to small size, it really wasn't that much bigger than LDS, pre RDNA 3 it was actually the same size as one WGP LDS. Crazy to think about a mid level cache shared by 5 WGPs only having the same cache size as one LDS!  >I suspect that AMD would increase the LDS (AMD now calls it ""shared memory"" like Nvidia) to 192kb or 256kb and give it shared L1 cache functionality.  A 256kb L0+LDS addressable mem slab similar to Turing would help AMD a lot. That's already planned in GFX12.5 / CDNA 2 where they plan to allow greater LDS and L0/texture cache allocation flexibility similar to how Volta/Turing does this.  RDNA 5 could go beyond this even, but we'll see, perhaps M3 style L1$ with Registers directly in it. No preallocation of registers and no register for untaken branches = massive über-shaders and no shader precompilation at all just to mention one benefit. Massive performance implications for RT and branchy code in general too + GPU work graphs acceleration.",Neutral
AMD,3 out of tree.  >32kb of L0 + 32kb of L0 Vector + 16kb of L0 Scalar cache (per cu)   >192kb or 256kb of L1/SLM (Similar to Nvidia/Intel)  Prob two separate data path ways. One for L0 cache and LDS and one for instruction caches similar to how NVIDIA Turing and later does it.  But the overhauled scheduling with WGS mentioned by Kepler (see my prev posts in here) does mean that the Shader Engine will need some sort of shared mid level cache for its autonomous scheduling domain.   So I think L1 will make a return but this time one big L1 shared between entire Shader Engine and a proper capacity like let's say 1MB perhaps even more (2MB?). That could explain why the L2 is being shrunk so massively on RDNA5 according to the specs shared by MLID. 24MB L2 for the AT2 die IIRC. That die will have 70 CUs and should perform around a 4090 in raster. That's a far cry from the 9070 XTs 64MB or the 4090's 72MB.,Neutral
AMD,"Two out of three.   >Combined with the rumor that AMD will get rid of the L3 infinity cache in favor of a much larger + lower latency L2 like Nvidia and Intel and RDNA5's cache hierarchy could look very similar to Nvidia or Intel's   L3 throws performance/mm\^2 out the window. AMD opting to effectively mid L2 and L3 into one cache in-between like NVIDIA's L2, which is slightly higher latency than AMD's L2, seems like a wise decision.  Will allow them to cut down on area considerable. Look at how Navi 44 at 199mm\^2 is competiting against 181mm\^2 NVIDIA. It's not the SMs that are larger it's the MALL + bigger frontend bloating the AMD design.   NVIDIA's die actually has 36 SMS vs 32 CUs so that makes it even worse for AMD and the 9060XT still looses to 5060 TI 16GB, despite significantly higher clocks.  >Intel allocates 96kb to L1 and 160kb to SLM in the 256kb shared L1/SLM cache block in Battlemage.   Damn that's a huge cache.

It has great latency as it's small and very close to the CU's which should benefit scalar workloads/RT/anything that's latency sensitive.   **What I think AMD should do**   AMD should expand the size of LDS to 192/256kb and make it a dual purpose L1/SLM WGP wide cache shared between 2CU's (hitrate should be a lot better for a shared  WGP wide cache than a 5WGP Shader Array cache)    It should allow more scalar operations to be done closer to the SIMD's, along with improving RT performance",Neutral
AMD,"It wouldn't be easy to add a cache, that's 1mb in size, shared accross a shader array, have good enough latency characteristics to meaningfully benefit over hitting the L2 and allow the GPU to clock at 3.2-3.4Ghz    I**t would take a lot of time and engineers to create and validate such a cache and the opportunity cost is that they will have less time to work on the RT pipeline and WGS ect.**    *It's a lot easier to just expand the LDS, make it serve as L1 and handle scheduling through the L2.*    **Instead of expanding the Shader Array L1 like in RDNA3(they could've doubled it to 512kb in RDNA4), AMD dedicated a ton of time and engineers to remove it in RDNA4 which could mean that AMD simply thought that such a cache is not worth keeping.**   **Why would AMD go through all the trouble to remove a Shader Array L1 and then add it back in with RDNA5?**",Negative

AMD,"Thr Arc B580 needs 256kb of L1/SLM since the battlemage architecture is more latency sensitive compared to RDNA4.   Battlemage lacks:   **Scalar Datapath**   A dedicated scalar data path to offload scalar workloads so that it doesn't clog up the main SIMD units     Battlemage however has **scalar optimizations** that allows the compiler to pack scalar operations in a SIMD1 wavefront (or it can gather these operations and execute them as a single 16-wide wavefront)    This SIMD-1 wavefront has ~15ns latency from L1/SLM which is better than standard wavefront latency   **imperfect wavefront tracking**    Wavefront tracking is determine by a static software scheduler with each of the 8 XVE's per XE core being able to track up to 8 wavefronts that consist of up to 128 registers    If an XVE needs to track shadars that consist of more than 128 registers then the XVE needs to switch to ""Large GRF mode"" this allows shaders to have up to 256 registers each but only allows for up to 4 wavefronts per SIMD16 XVE to be tracked   In comparison each 32-wide SIMD in an individual RDNA CU can track up up 16 32-wide wavefronts if each wave takes up less than 64 registers **More importantly shader occupancy declines gracefully in a granular manner** (probably managed at the hardware level)   **Large instruction cache**    Intel's Alchemist had a huge 96kb instruction cache per Xe core this is much larger than 2x 32kb L0i instruction cache in each WGP (each servicing a CU)    [Intel didn't detail the size of the inst cache but we can assume it's similar to Alchemist]   It likely needs such an instruction cache since SIMD16 requires a lot more instruction control overhead than a 32-wide wavefront    On the other hand 16-wide wavefronts have lower branch divergence   **Implications for Xe3**    From the Chips and cheese article about the Xe3 microarchitecture it seems like Intel has fixed many issues present in Xe2    **Xe3 wavefront tracking**    10 wavefronts can now be tracked by each XVE with up to 96 registers each and occupancy with shaders eith more registers now declines in a granular and graceful manner   ** Xe3 dedicated scalar register added**   Could be a sign that Intel has implemented a scalar data path like RDNA and Turing    **Xe3 Scoreboard tokens**   Scoreboard tokens increased from 180 -> 320 per XVE allong more long-latency instructions to be tracked    **16 Xe cores per Render Slice (up from 4 in Xe2)**   Sr0 topology bits have been modified to allow each render slice to have up to 16Xe cores    This allows a hypothetical maximum 16 render slice GPU to increase from 64Xe cores in Xe2 to 256Xe cores in Xe3    Intel isn't likely going to be making such a big configuration however it does mean that the Xe3 architecture is more flexible since the amount of Xe cores in a given GPU is less tied to the **fixed function GPU hardware inside each Render Slice**    AMD's shader engines (render slices) can have up to 10WGP    **FCVT + HF8 support for XMX engines added to Xe3**",Neutral

AMD,"There is something else people are missing in this discussion, neural rendering, this will most likely be the primary driver alongside pathtracing performance in their decision making. Of course AMD is also extremely area focused in their designs as well since this uarch will likely go into consoles, so it will need to be cost-optimized in a way nvidia doesn't do.  With these things said, the LDS is used for matrix multiplication on both AMD and Nvidia designs, and with Blackwell Nvidia also added a dedicated cache for the tensor cores on top of the LDS. Since AMD is currently behind Nvidia they need to catch up, and just relying on their old ways of trying to implement features in compute shaders isn't going to cut it - they _need_ dedicated silicon for both matmul and caches to match Nvidia. But then again they probably won't since it needs to be cost optimized for consoles, I think rdna5 will be a dud on laptop/desktop for this reason unless Nvidia decides to not care about this market segment anymore.  The console focus on their design is the main reason Radeon is lackluster on laptop/desktop IMO.",Neutral
AMD,"It was 128kb for a Shader Array containing 5WGPs in RDNA 1-2. In RDNA3 they doubled it to 256kb across 4WGPs. So effectively 2.5X more per L1 cache per WGP but nowhere near enough xD.  Yikes. Yep really bad.  L0 vector cache/data cache/texture cache is directly coupled to TMUs and RT cores reside within those. At least that's the way it's shown in the  But if you talk about the instruction cache and scalar cache yeah prob no changes there.  There's no change it's just increased flexibility. So each workload can change the ratio between L0 vector and LDS depending on the workload. Different µarch but Turing did this as well, it's all about increased flexibility but that'll obviously depend on workload. Tradeoff between L0 latency and spillover to LDS.  That would make sense.    But I don't see it getting to 256kb. But 256kB total split between L0+LDS and variable depending on workload as indicated in LLVM for CDNA5, spotted by Kepler\_L2. We'll see though. The design might be so radically different from RDNA 4 that expectations and ""established facts"" needs to be recalibrated. Timeline aligns with clean slate. AMD does these every \~6-7 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Not a shader array, a shader engine. Yeah we'll see. But that a medium sized cache will have lower latency than a big L2 but yeah massive R&D effort for sure, so we'll see if it happens.  Because it didn't make any sense for that particular design. It's just speculation and I'm not a semiconductor professional but disaggregated scheduling would benefit from a lower latency mid level cache. IF RDNA 5 is iterative then prob not, if it's clean slate not seen since GCN then really anything could be on the table. There's also patents that fundamentally overhaul how caches work, one that I talked about in a earlier reply that boosts cache hit rates massively, by carefully selecting data that benefits being in L1 and shunning other data that would otherwise cause cache thrashing and lower cache hit rates significantly. There are others so it might make sense to add it back.  This is just mindless speculation, don't take it too seriously. I'm just proposing ideas.",Neutral
AMD,It's past diminishing returns. Gaming isn't inference.    NVIDIA should've just upgraded to 20gbps it would have been fine.,Negative
AMD,"Thanks for the interesting info.   I didn't know Intel did SIMD16. Speculated AMD would perhaps go SIMD16 x 4 in RDNA 5 to help with branchy code and RT, but Intel has this already hmm.  The stuff about Xe2 is analogous to GCN, I know the variables/causes are wildly different but it sounds like the outcome is the same. Horrible utilization in gaming and scheduling bottlenecks. Xe3 sounds good though but still worried about die area with all the overhead associated with SIMD16.",Neutral
AMD,Agreed which is why I compared it with NVIDIA's implementation. MALL was never really more than a victim cache and a memory BW multiplier.   Yep 100%. IIRC AMD stated doubled L2 in RDNA 4 was for RT performance.  They might have some interesting tech in RDNA 5 for that. I saw a patent that prevented cache thrashing. It applied to L1 not L2 but can't see why they shouldn't do that for L2 in RDNA 5 as well. with 64MB -> 24MB cache rumoured for 9070XT to AT2 you would want the most important data in L2 and avoid cache thrashing whenever possible. Obviously not perfect but it should at least boost cache hit rates significantly.,Neutral

AMD,100%. Neural rendering and neural everything really. That is what makes the CPX = 6090 speculation interesting. Seems far fetched but it's still possible. Guess we'll have to wait for GTC 2026 on that one though. No real specs for CPX rn.  RDNA 5 is as co-design between Sony and AMD and it's pretty much guaranteed that there's a heavy focus on AI and RT. Watch the PS5 Pro december coverage around SIE presentation by Cerny and DF interview. The guy is all in on ML and RT. He dictates what Sony gets in PS6 and AMD will have to match that whether they like it or not.    Raster is solved so Sony would rather gimp that by 15-20% and invest heavily in RT and ML than waste all silicon on raster. Nothing is confirmed though but they can't rely on raw perf anymore. PS6 can only differentiate itself on features so that's what they'll push.  RDNA 4 has eq. TFLOPs ML perf compared to NVIDIA. Look at the specs sheet of a 4080 vs 9070XT. Only thing missing is FP4 to compete with 50 series but nextgen will have that. But if CPX is indeed 6090 die then RDNA 5 stands no chance against 60 series in ML performance.,Neutral

AMD,"Okay so a few corrections because your understanding of the situation is totally off: the driver isn't doing a DLL swap currently for FSR4. It's actually the FSR3.1 SDK that's implemented in the game that's doing the swap. Also one more correction: ALL FSR 3.1 games use a DLL. The only thing that isn't standard is the use of the AMD provided and signed DLL. But all 85-ish games mentioned in the article here still use the signed FSR3.1 DLLs. The blacklist for FSR4 is empty now: now all titles that have the official, signed FSR3.1 DLL can be upgraded.   The FSR3.1 SDK has a function included that checks to see if the driver has allowed an FSR4 upgrade for a specific title (and setting the option in Adrenaline will toggle this value). If the FSR3.1 SDK sees that value sets, it grabs the FSR4 DLL from the driver files directly, and uses that instead. FYI, this is also why FSR4 can be injected on Linux in exactly the same fashion - Proton supports setting this registry key that indicates whether an FSR4 upgrade is possible or not. Currently, Adrenaline does not let you toggle this value to enable the FSR4 upgrade for titles that use a non-signed version of FSR3.1 - so if a developer makes a couple of small changes or tweaks to the FSR3.1 SDK and/or just decides to compile their own DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade will not be an option in that title (at least, at the moment).  However, members of the Optiscaler Discord have tested that if you replace a game's non-signed FSR3.1 DLL with the signed official DLL, then the FSR4 upgrade toggle does appear in Adrenaline.   > Important note - FSR 4 is not compatible with FSR 3.1 titles that run on the Vulkan® API or use non-standard methods of integration of FSR 3.1 into their games, such as using third-party plug-ins or methods that do not use the signed FSR 3.1 DLL.  > In short, some devs shipped unsigned FSR 3.1 DLLs from older plugin versions and FSR4 won't support that.   > Easy fix that should work - replace the FSR 3.1 DLL with the signed one from FFX SDK 1.1.4/FSR 3.1.4  This is actually something AMD could do in the way Nvidia does with DLSS4 DLL swapping in their driver as an experimental feature.

AMD,ps5 pro can use fsr4 and will use it next year.,Neutral
AMD,"But as also noted by DF - and other outlets as well - DLSS4 does suffer from worse disocclusion artifacting compared to FSR4. So the above commenters point about trading blows is correct, even if you can definitely argue (and I'd think you'd be right to) that DLSS4 does have more advantages over FSR4 and is still better overall.  That being said, your original point that AMD ""need to get on the DLSS trajectory"" and FSR4 being ""still about a generation behind Nvidia"" don't really line up with reality. The two are reasonably close to one another at this point in terms of upscaling, it's really the other stuff (e.g. ray reconstruction) where AMD needs to put effort in catching up now (and that is what Redstone is supposed to do).",Neutral
AMD,Did we watch the same DF video? Because the ones i've seen they clearly say it's between DLSS 3 and DLSS 4 in terms of quality.,Neutral

DLSS overrides for any game using DLSS 2.x+ are officially supported through the Nvidia app and have been since DLSS4 came out.

AMD,You mean those “AI Accelerators” and it being “Architectured to exceed 3.0Ghz”?,Neutral
AMD,"Huh, after I set fsr4 on in adrenaline it showed up in cyberpunk.  That's annoying and un-intuitive.",Negative
AMD,"I use both FSR and DLSS as I split time between two places and keep a PC at each. I definitely wouldn't say they're reasonably close yet. It's not the canyon wide gap that was DLSS3 vs FSR3, but it's still quite significant in my experience.  And as far as I can tell the disocclusion artifacting issue is highly dependent on the game. I've only encountered it a couple of times, whereas I encounter quite a lot of artifacting with FSR every time I use it.",Neutral
AMD,"My takeaway was that it's very marginally better than DLSS3. Not close to DLSS4. Though to be fair that's still a big jump forward for FSR. FSR3 was straight up bad, 4 is definitely not.

AMD,Dlss for ever game is not officially support via override go try to use it in greyzone you cant it has dlss 4 fg but 3.0 upscaling  The support for DLSS 4 transformer model is a white list and its very limited. Most people using optiscaler but u dont use that in a anticheat game so its limited in use.   FSR 1 is still the objectively best upscaler its just that DLSS/FSR replace TAA and because FSR 1 doesn't you get the shitty built in taa.  NIS is no where near as good as FSR 1 or as good as RSR btw. Its not even comparable NIS is just a low tap Laczos with no edge refinement or anything not to mention the sharpening filter in NIS is the worst sharpener I have ever seen. I don't know why Nvidia doesn't hire some reshade devs who have made good filters because AMD has the best sharpeners and Nvidia has the worst it would help DLSS greatly if they had a sharpener even on the same ballpark as rcas.,Negative
AMD,"No idea what the 3ghz is supposed to represent but the lack of fp8 is the reason. There is a big performance hit when using it on rnda 3 and you have people running it on Linux as proof.

AMD,"I personally disagree, MHW and Spider Man 2 looked equally as good in my experience on both a 4070 super and a 9070 xt. Maybe the latter's power helps that, but I was very impressed with FSR4 outside limited support on launch. The tech itself is nice.",Positive
AMD,"Is FSR3 better than DLSS1? What about DLSS2?  I sometimes think about how something which was worse than FSR3.1, which is not great, made people so hyperbolic, like it was such a big deal  Edit: Blocked smh, my reply was going to be ""Quite a motte.""",Negative
AMD,"It is officially supported in every game if you use the global override, you can confirm it with the DLSS indicator overlay.

Apple can get away without SMT because they can keep the core well fed enough not to need it. This comes from better branch prediction, more bandwidth, bigger OoO circuitry, etc...

AMD,"That is not true what so ever, SMT was made to make sure you take full use of the core while the other thread has unused parts of the CPU, that happens on Apple CPUs as well, 1T doesn't take the full width of the architecture that's why they focus so much on making sure branch prediction is the best in the world.  SMT is only used ""effectively"" in throughput oriented workloads, for example, SMT can reduce gaming performance, not increase it. ARM makes SMT enabled cores for automotive because there's a reason for it, due to a ton of threads it needs to handle the workloads in real time.

AMD,"> That is not true what so ever, SMT was made to make sure you take full use of the core while the other thread has unused parts of the CPU, that happens on Apple CPUs as well, 1T doesn't take the full width of the architecture that's why they focus so much on making sure branch prediction is the best in the world.  No you are confusing things. Apple core can only run one thread at a time. It doesn't have SMT. Apple core uses extreme ILP (instruction level parallelism) to take advantage of the width of the core but you can't have multiple logical threads use the core without context switching.  > 1T doesn't take the full width of the architecture that's why they focus so much on making sure branch prediction is the best in the world.  This is wrong as well. An advanced branch predictor is far more important to the performance of the long pipeline cores such as Zen or Intel P cores. Because a branch missprediction is much more costly when you have a long pipeline. AMD's and Intel's branch predictors are quite sophisticated for this reason. AMD is constantly redoing their branch predictor, and Zen5 got a whole knew from ground up design in this most recent iteration.",Neutral
AMD,"No, AMD designed their CPU for heavy multi-threaded workloads.  Zen 5 is a pretty big and wide core by x86 standards, and AMD knows that it's difficult to find instruction level parallelism in x86 (more than it is for ARM at least). So they optimised the core's design for maximum performance with SMT. As a consequence they opted for 2x 4-wide decode instead of a more complex 8-wide that can also do 2x 4 (for SMT).   This is also a consequence of AMD targeting server workloads, which Apple doesn't.  So when you compare Apple's ARM core to a Zen 5 core using single-threaded benchmarks, you are not really comparing the performance of each core.",Neutral

AMD and Intel do everything to minimize memory latency on the desktop, even at a price of increased idle power draw and temps. This doesn't hinge on whether the chip itself has high or low inherent latency. In fact the chiplet design of the Ryzen is known for poor latency.  I was just saying that the 9950X draws 40W idle by design and this number doesn't reflect its efficiency. You could turn off SoC OC mode and get 10-15W idle. But even then most of the power draw is due to the SoC and the Infinity Fabric. AMD's chiplet design is inherently bad at minimizing idle power draw, x86 or not. The monolithic R9 395 draws 5W idle with the same 16 Zen 5 cores.",Negative

They added accelerators to target specific use case of their niche market and that's basically it. All the speed bump are related to node advantage and frequency boost there is nothing new under the sun and I doubt it will change anytime soon.  In fact they are stuck on the high-end of things, they can't figure out how to scale their Ultra chips (that is already gluing 2 chips and doesn't scale very well) because they already are at the limits of manufacturing and physics.

AMD,"What I meant is that Apple does not sell chips for handhelds, desktops or laptops. AMD does not sell handhelds, desktops or laptops. They are not direct competitors.   But even going a level deeper, the number of people who will make a major change to give up on Windows or Linux for a Mac (the only way for AMD to actually even indirectly lose chip sales to Apple) is very small, and many prohibitive barriers are in place before the CPU is a consideration. It very rarely happens, as evident by Apple's stable market share.  Apple has steadily held single digit market share of systems for decades regardless of chips they used, and now that chunk of the market is exclusively served by Apple chips, with no way for AMD to compete regardless of how they perform. Likewise, Apple does not attempt to compete by selling chips for ~90% of desktops, handhelds or laptops that don't run MacOS, so they don't notably threaten AMD's business regardless if they're faster or slower.   In other words, for 9 out of 10 desktop/laptop/handheld buyers, the performance of Apple desktop/laptop/potential handheld chips does not matter as that performance and those chips cannot be in any way utilized in the software environments that people actually use - there is no way you can buy an Apple chip to accelerate those workloads as is.",Neutral

I know we are in a hardware forum obsessed with performance of individual components, but even a 30% performance difference isn't going to make a large dent in the users who just don't want to use the Mac ecosystem.

Cutting out another core or two doesn't really make a difference in terms of direct weight loss since the cores don't really weigh much. I'm assuming you mean since it has less cores they could design it with fewer thermals in mind and overall less weight because of reduced thermal management system. They can and already do that with the M chips. They will simply thermal throttle at different workload lengths.  I guess what we each call 'significant' in terms of weight in this context is pretty subjective. Even the 15in macbook air, IMO, is so insignificant to the overall weight of my bag, it's hard for me to notice if it's there or not.

You can have a 30% faster CPU in it, but it is clear from the relatively stable OS market share that people replacing their existing Windows/Linux device look for new Windows/Linux devices, and people looking to replace a MacBook look for the newest MacBook. Moves from one to the other are rare among mass market users. This also isn't changing, as there are firm barriers that have never moved. Among others, despite existing for decades, Macs remain impractical in the vast majority of the world, where the OS is just not commonly used or well supported.  From the technical perspective, as a hardware geek I can appreciate the work that Apple teams did on their silicon, and it's great to see those performance gains. People with an old Mac may be tempted to upgrade.

AMD,"> 3D Rendering can be equally done on the GPU, there is no justification to run that on the CPU.  Yes there is, when your scene doesn’t fit in VRAM. No, this is not a hypothetical niche case. GPU rendering is not adopted in many film workflows because of VRAM issues. In many cases, GPU renderers have additional feature limitations, ex, in Blender you can’t run custom OSL shaders when using GPU rendering on macOS (choosing macOS here because that’s a platform where VRAM limits don’t apply due to the unified memory)  > The issue is that not all Cinema4D Projects will be identical in performance, there are massive differences between projects (just see more extensive Blender tests, for each project the relative performance differs).  For the most part, these differences are consistent from processor to processor and are mostly the result of the number of computations the scene needs, not different workloads. Ex, if scene A is 30% slower than scene B on processor X, it tends to also be 30% slower on processor Y.  > The Benchmark itself is designed to exclude all other aspects like RAM speed and Cache which makes it purely synthetic. The only reason to run renders on the CPU instead of GPU are projects that exceed your GPUs RAM capacity. But then, Cinebench doesn't tell you anything.  No, that’s just the workload CPU render engines present. I’m sorry if my job does not tax the hardware subsystem you wish it did, but that’s the way it is. Cinebench is quite frankly an excellent proxy for 3D render performance in general, as your remaining paragraphs explain quite well.  If you don’t care about 3D render performance, that’s fine.

Several ""Smart home"" / ""IoT"" apps because the company is dead or the old hardware I have is now ""unsupported"".  For one specific example, I have an old lighting setup and the hub and bulbs work perfectly, but the app was pulled from the store in favor of a new version. The new version of the app won't work with my hub unless I update the hub firmware and lose basic functionality that they put behind a paywall and ""cloud service"" for spying.  File manager apps because Android is fucking awful and constantly changes the file system and breaks things, all in the name of ""protecting"" me when I'm trying to do something as simple as move a file on my device to another folder or organize downloads and attachments from email.  And there are also times where I downloaded an app on one device only to be told it's ""not compatible"" or ""not available"" on another device due to bullshit fake requirements, regional settings, things being pulled from the store for new downloads but still present for existing users / updates, or Google's awful practice of beta testing releases to random subsets of users and hiding them from others (Google's not the only one guilty of this).

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.

But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron. For those on a budget, the 5800XT looks even more attractive because it has gone on sale for $125-150 and comes with a decent cooler.",Neutral

Considering intel's current financial difficulties, I'm sure it was considered a waste of resource to design and validate desktop chips that aren't amazing on anything but power efficiency. LGA 1851 still supports 3 gens on mobile, where power efficiency matters the most.   LGA 1954 will likely support 3+ gens again, like LGA 1851, but with all the products coming to desktop.

AMD,">AMD can confidently ship products across multiple nodes and product families without having to worry about over- or undercapacity at a single fab.  They cant. This is why AMD had both CPU and GPU underproduction this year unable to fulfil demand for either. They simply didnt buy enough capacity in advance, which needs to be done years before you actually want the chips.",Negative
AMD,"Only Alder Lake and Raptor Lake at Intel are tied to their process node; Intel's later products - Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake - and those that come later, aren't tied to any specific node.  Intel 7 is fully amortized and will likely be functional only to meet obligations for Alder Lake and Raptor Lake over their entire product life cycles.  Intel 3 is being used for their Xeons, and the Ireland facility that makes them recently announced upgrades for additional capacity. Intel 3 will also be used for the smaller iGPU tile in Panther Lake.  Panther Lake will be on 18A, future Xeons will be on 18A, and Nova Lake will also have 18A as well. Their upcoming E-core Xeon - Clearwater Forest - will also have base tiles for cache and interconnects made on Intel 3.  Seems flexible enough to me.  AMD's situation with TSMC isn't as advantageous as you think. For example they always deprioritize GPUs in favour of CPUs when both of them use the same node. RDNA4 is the most clear-cut example of this.",Neutral
AMD,"Non existent.  That was a thing about a decade ago.  First of all, Intel can still produce in different nodes.  Intel had the problem that they developed both architectures and process nodes together which both had advantages and disadvantages.  You can’t just switch out the process node for an architecture, every architecture is designed for some nodes specifications. The more you focus on one node the better you can use its advantages which is one of the reasons why Intel was typically superior with their chips. But that also comes with drawbacks like Intels 10nm issues.  Intel didn’t stay with basically Kaby lake for years because they wanted to but because they couldn’t switch to ice lake without the 10nm node. And that’s the reason why Intel fell back on the desktop and servers. If you look at their roadmaps, what became Tiger lake H was supposed to come out as Ice lake in like 2018. But with Rocket Lake they backported Ice lake to 14nm which worked more or less well, depending on who you ask. Since then, Intel developed their Architectures with no specific node in mind which makes them as flexible as any fabless company.   I’d say if anything it’s a huge advantage to have your own fabs today because you can determine how much volume you want for yourself.  TSMC is basically a monopoly at that point which also means that all three, NVIDIA, AMD and Intel compete over capacities and that drives up cost.  And then there is Apple. Apple is like a first class customer of TSMC (for good reasons) and they’re the ones to decide how much they leave for the rest.",Neutral
AMD,When Node Development was not a money hog it was good idea to be IDM but as Nodes got expensive and more difficult people started to drop and brings to our present condition of only 3 companies with fabs.  Now for Advantage of fab is margin stacking if you do it correctly you can get  > Margin Stacking   > Volume and you control your supply chain not other companies.  > Custom Process tightly coupled with design allowing you to bend design rules a bit.  Cons > Without enough volume it's a net loss to run fabs. >  Very risky and if you fail you end up like Intel.  Fabs less > Lower risk > Outsourced manufacturing means low Capex requirements. Cons > You are at the mercy of your partner if he screws up your product screws up as well. > IP Issue if your outsourced fab is also a competitor.,Neutral
AMD,"> How big of an advantage is fabless flexibility in practice?  Huge. Not being tied to a fab's success or failure, not being forced to make a direct investment in that yourself, not having to worry about maximizing utilization of that fab, it all adds up. You can see this playing out with Intel real time. They've written down billion of dollars worth of equipment for their newer nodes because of low utilization, and their old nodes are so expensive to manufacture it's a major reason their foundry is so deeply in the red.",Neutral
AMD,It cuts the other way as well. A independent Intel foundry would have it a lot easier attracting customers.   Right now a customer wouldn't know if it isn't always a second priority to whatever intel deems necessary to their own products.   Also there is the question of exposing your roadmap to a company you are directly competing with on products.  A Intel with both design and foundry is only attractive to those who want monopolistic advantages. If a presumably better node were on intels hands it would only serve them and their products.,Neutral

AMD,">How big of an advantage is fabless flexibility in practice?    This is kind of bagging the question. That there is an advantage or even a choice here.   If you don't have 10 billion to invest in fabs you are a fabless. To basically everyone.   There is no flexibility on leading nodes in this industry. You get TSMC one of the few alternatives.   I imagine TSMCs customers pay what TSMC tells them to, only constrained by the reality they can't get too crazy lest they help support Intel when the customers revolt.   This is not a real thing in practice. Design teams are targeting a node whatever it is.   The cost to switch or support multiple nodes is what it is too. You can switch or hedge different options but there are costs.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a couple of follow-up questions since I’m not an expert on nodes:  * When you say **Intel 7 is fully amortized**, what does that really mean in this context? I get that fabs are expensive and equipment gets “paid off” over time, but since these machines are tightly programmed and occupy massive amounts of space, wouldn’t they still represent opportunity cost if they’re just kept alive to meet obligations? * Also, on the point about products being **“tied” to a node** — could you expand on what that practically means? For example, AMD has shown flexibility in the past, like when they re-lithographed Polaris (RX 580 → RX 590 on 12nm). Would that kind of move count as being “not node tied”? * And for Intel specifically, how should we think about this? Are their designs today still bound in ways that limit shifting across nodes, or is the tile-based approach (like with iGPU/cache tiles on Intel 3 vs. cores on 18A) essentially giving them AMD-like flexibility?  Would love to hear more of your perspective on that.",Neutral
AMD,It's a huge risk to have an in-house fab that doesn't get any outside business. 2 points of failure on design and fab side that stop the whole thing.  Intel got stagnant on the design side and then stumbled on the fab side (which causes more churn on the design side) to end up in the huge mess they are in today.,Negative
AMD,"So basically with IDM you gain flexibility in design rules and stronger IP security, but you carry all the risk. If you have Intel-level missteps — like missing the mobile wave while PC demand was already declining — the fab overhead turns into billions in write-downs each quarter.  What I find interesting is TSMC’s strategy. They’ve always stuck to the principle of never competing with their customers, unlike Samsung, which builds both its own chips and fabs. That seems to be a big part of why everyone from Apple to AMD has enough trust to let TSMC handle their lithography.  Do you think TSMC’s “pure-play” stance is really the genius move here — the key reason they’ve become the dominant foundry while so many others dropped out?",Neutral
AMD,How behind performance wise are Samsung/GF and SMIC for non-flagship node compared to equvialent nodes like TSMC's N7P/N7+ and N5? As not every company need N2/N3.,Neutral
AMD,"ADL/RPL were designed specifically for Intel 7. Intel 7 was design with ADL/RPL in mind. The two are closely related. It would require a lot of work to bring ADL/RPL to a different node.   One of the main improvements that ARL/LNL brought was internal design changes that make Intel designs in line with industry standards, using industry standard design tools vs previous designs being custom-made for specific internal nodes. This doesnt matter (directly) to the customer, but it does help Intel's engineering efforts easier going forward.    And while yes there's an opportunity cost to continuing to use Intel 7, a lot of Intel 7's cost structure was paying off the massive NRE costs due to its multi-year delay. These costs were fully depreciated H2 of last year, making Intel 7 much more cost effective.   But besides that, fabs need different types of nodes at different price points. The lithograph equipment used for Intel 7 can't just be reporposed for new nodes which use EUV. Its either use it on Intel 7 (or 16) or let it sit unused. Bartlett Lake exists almost entirely just for this reason.",Neutral
AMD,"1. That is basically what it means. As for tooling and machinery, some of them that were intended for the fab expansions that are now either cancelled or have been slowed down, have been repurposed as upgrades for existing manufacturing, so expect those to pay themselves off as well in the future. 2. Since Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake, Intel's core IP, at least on the CPU side, is ""99% process node agnostic"", to quote one of the lead engineers who worked on the Lion Cove P-core that goes into Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake. What it means that they don't have to design with a specific process node in mind, and their workflows and design rules reflect that.  3. Basically the choice of node boils down to performance-power-area - which are intrinsic to the nodes themselves, and cost of wafers, time-to-market, and volume availability. The economic aspect as characterized by the latter, can sometimes be more important in determining which product uses which node. For example, Nova Lake, the desktop successor to Arrow Lake, will use both 18A and some advanced TSMC node for the compute tiles.",Neutral
AMD,TSMC is not unfailiable no one is it's just they are executing better currently if Intel hadn't shot itself so many times in the foot TSMC wouldn't be so dominant. There Is only one rules in semi manufacturing the best node(PPA and yield) wins that's it.,Neutral
AMD,"These are questions with nuanced answers: better in terms of what metric? Power, area, durability, defects?   Most of people could tell you would be under their NDA and other legal restrictions to talk about it.   Your best source of information for something like this would be the Asianometry YouTube channel or similar aggregators because they are probably not bound the same way.    That said they get their information through press releases, announcements, papers, inferring, educated guesses and leaks.",Neutral
AMD,"Exactly, TSMCs last node, N3, was essentially an L. It took a while (and some alterations) for it to really get to healthy yields and performance. If they had competition, there absolutely could’ve been some customers willing to switch. IF. Instead, Intel was on fire and Samsung was busy huffing glue, so the status quo remained.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the constructive reply! Yeah, I’m more of a layman in this space, so I really appreciate the sources you mentioned and I fully understand the NDA limits around these discussions. I’ve always been curious about how much smaller nodes really matter in practice. For example, I use four different 7 nm-class chips across my devices: my desktop (Zen 3) and tablet (Kirin 990 4G) are on TSMC N7, my phone (Kirin 9010) is on SMIC’s 7 nm equivalent, and my laptop runs on Intel 7. I’ve often wondered about the differences between these “same-node” designs, both in terms of marketing vs. actual performance. And looking at newer phones, even the latest 3 nm chips don’t feel like they bring Moore’s Law-level leaps compared to what 5 nm delivered five years ago.  Would love to hear any more insights into how meaningful these node shifts really are in everyday use!",Positive

AMD,"It becomes very specific to the design, any performance changes and the limits of parallelism.   Adding more cores to a single threaded workload will not improve performance.   Adding a larger cache may. Density should help there.   Memories can really benefit from a die shrink because in theory you can have the same design with minor updates just smaller. Then you can have more dies, or arrays of memory cells.   Designs that have multiple dies also have special trade offs in that area. It gets very technical.   Thermal considerations also are really part of this. Many devices are now thermally limited so whatever process reduces heat or helps extract that heat to the cooling design has an impact.   But some designs/workloads are not as effected by this.   And this is not even going into and talking about just improving design because not surprisingly a lot of the performance is made or lost based on the design itself.",Neutral
AMD,"So what you’re saying is that this really becomes a *system-level project*? We can’t judge node progress linearly by one parameter alone — instead, it’s about balancing across a wider set of trade-offs depending on the design goals and the target users. That makes sense, and I guess strong project management across the whole chain is pretty essential for success (Intel’s history being a good example here).  I’m currently studying computer engineering at university and I’d really like to get into the IC design field. Do you have any suggestions on where to start learning more about these trade-offs and the broader design/management aspects? Thanks a lot!",Neutral

The 9070 is currently so power limited that simply pushing more power is a completely viable option for a refresh.  266W would enable AMD to bump the clock speeds by 300-400 Mhz, which would keep the 9070 firmly in contention with the 5070 Super, while costing AMD and their board partners nothing, since 9070s usually have 9070 XT coolers specced for 304W or higher, I think the Sapphire pulse 9070 is the only exception.  AMD would simply have to push a new BIOS and/or unlock the power limiter in Adrenalin. They could potentially even push an update in Adrenalin that swaps the vBIOS.  I'd probably still pick the 5070 Super over the 266W 9070, but it still wouldn't be a complete no-brainer, since the 5070 Super would probably be worse in raster, but better in RT. If AMD Redstone launches before the 5070 Super and gives a nice bump in ray traced (and especially path traced) titles, I think the 9070 could remain competitive.",Neutral

We can bemoan this public perception all we want--both Nvidia and the site-that-shall-not-be-named have scummy practices and advertising, after all--and the plural of anecdotes is not evidence, but there's no way around the fact that the 9070 XT pricing fiasco was a terrible look for AMD and arguably also for hardware enthusiast communities to a lesser extent.",Neutral

AMD,"this was actually one of the most interesting things to me. I saw a lot of people hyping up amd cpus, especially the x3ds, and speaking of older cpus as if they were literally obsolete but whenever i saw actual videos of performance or sites that showed what their performance differences would be they were always kind of minor relative to the price differences. a lot of the claims are also just wrong. like i'd see someone say ""this amd cpu is waaaaaaaaaaaay faster than this intel cpu, get this one,"" and i look at performances to see that the two cpus are basically equivalents as far as gaming goes.",Positive
AMD,My favorite is when they put different CPUs up against each other and say one is slow and the games have 100+ FPS. Testing Games on youtube does more realistic reviews by using hardware in the same way the average gamer will by jacking up the settings as high as they can go.,Positive
AMD,"> HUB never claimed this ever lol.  There is a massive hate boner for HUB in this thread in particular.  I recently rewatched some of it and it's clear that HUB was referring to retailers serving the DIY market in Australia in the first launch week. Nothing else.  Looking at mindfactory data, we know that AMD did really well in their launch for the 9070/XT cards.  So any data we have shows that HUB wasn't talking shit.  What most of the ""HUB IS WRONG"" crowd don't get: Steam Surveys actually show perfectly well how tiny the DIY segment is.  It simply doesn't matter at all how DIY does, prebuilts will outsell DIY by two orders of magnitude. Shocking that HUB don't have insight sources inside Dell, HP and Lenovo. How dare they not have that.  So congrats AMD, you had a great launch in 1% of the market. But that won't mean shit for the overall picture.   Especially in a segment none of these companies actually care about because it's neither data center nor AI.",Negative
AMD,DLSS was a huge improvement for lower tier gpus too.,Neutral
AMD,"Sometimes I think reddit/youtuber commenters can't fathom that there's a massive demographic of gamers who only play those kinds of games and maybe a few other games that may or may not be graphically heavy. I've given up on getting deep into that discourse because some people are stuck on how they think the world should be and not how the world is, i.e. people think 8gb cards shouldn't exist and get pissed at amd/nvidia for selling them and pissed at people for buying them because it's enough for them or they can't afford more.",Negative

AMD,"Yeah it's baffling that they've totally ignored the mobile market, or rather they are ignoring gaming laptops specifically which are always big sellers.  They've got a pretty great, efficient chip that could surely be cut down and segmented for mobile and offer some obvious tangible benefits (12GB+ VRAM at a lower cost) that would make it very attractive in a laptop but nope... apparently not interested.",Negative
AMD,If it launches at that price it'll be Nvidia's next 1080Ti I think. More than fast enough for many for years to come and no concerns about VRAM becoming an issue for about the same amount of time.,Positive

AMD,"Source it if you want to make that claim, sounds explosive.  The evidence we do have meanwhile says that AMD are just dogshit to work with as far being able to supply chips and have not forged relationships with the ODM's that matter in laptops like Compal, Wistron, Quanta etc. Intel and Nvidia meanwhile have and the effect is plain to see.  Of course AMD haven't even bothered to have a mobile dGPU this time around so it's not like anyone even could work with them on current gen gaming laptops etc.",Negative
AMD,"5090 contributes more to the revenues (since it's more expensive) which is what the argument is about, revenues.

Just search online you can even rent 5070s for AI.",Neutral
AMD,"This has nothing to do with Steam survey, which we are discussing and which closely corroborates the revenue streams as well. Its a factor but nowhere near the factor",Negative

AMD,Goes against the narrative.,Neutral
AMD,"Because they have been called ""planned obsolescence""",Neutral
AMD,"It's not. PCI-e 4.0 doesn't change the fact that many games will emergency evict textures and you'll get early 2000 texture resolution. It also doesn't eliminate VRAM related stutter, just mitigates some of it some of the time.  Unless you know for a fact that the only games you're going to play actually require less than 8GB (e.g. that one competitive game you play, 2D indie titles, etc.) those cards are just bad value.",Negative
AMD,"It's a typical case of what you use them for.  Esports games, games like Tarkov, MMOs like WoW or ARPGs like PoE2? X3D chips have absurd gains. like 15-50% when compared to their counterparts. It's completely insane. They can literally mask terrible optimization really well.  AAA games and overall most singleplayer games? Mostly GPU bound and/or just way less taxing on the CPUs. So there you barely see any gains or 14900k taking the lead, simply do to the single core IPC wins Raptor Cove has vs Zen4/5.  So really, it depends on the games you play.",Neutral
AMD,> Testing Games on youtube  That's also straight up a fake info channel,Negative
AMD,"Yep, and DLSS4 is now good enough to be used even in twitch shooters without artifacts causing gameplay issues.",Positive
AMD,"Well, in a few select games, if you use RT and no upscaling, you do. But that means someone buying the card will need to play those specific games with those specific settings to even notice the issue.",Neutral
AMD,Look at any general GPU review of a 4060 8GB - for e.g. Techpowerup.  Minimum FPS averages to over 70 for the 4060 in the games tested at 1080p.  The idea that 8 GB is insufficient for budget gamers is a notion that is out of touch with reality.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah because if you do ultra settings on an igpu with modern games it’ll just crash out (due to not having enough vram funnily enough), or it’ll be so slow you’ll be measuring seconds per frame nor frames per second. At that point it’s a useless test.  It’s not like it’s impossible to test at multiple settings, but 1) reviewers have a limited amount of time to test cards, and the time they have is only getting shorter with each review cycle, 2) medium settings aren’t standardised. Leaving out naming oddities like GTA V’s high being the medium setting, what each game decides to reduce when lowering settings down to the medium preset isn’t standard, one game might disable grass textures entirely while another will barely reduce them, and so on. If you want all games tested to be on a level playing field, it makes sense to crank all the settings to max. And 3) the whole point of a test is to push the GPUs to the max. If you drop the settings down to medium, with the high end modern cards you’re going to be limited by the CPU. If you do all your comparisons at 1080p low, then you’ll conclude that a 5080 has about the same performance as a 5090, even if that is definitely not the case.",Negative
AMD,"It's not youtubers problem when redditors conflate launch day numbers from few retailers with overall sales since then, which basically every single person complaining about youtubers does. The assertion then that this makes youtubers wrong is simply disingenuous when it very likely that their exact claim was correct.  Also, I never said Steam survey is bad, it still is most accurate data about sales we have, but there are plenty of people who claim it's perfect.  My previous post is already at -2, yet downvoters can't provide a single reasonable reason for 9070XT to be entirely missing from steam survey.",Negative
AMD,"No, you participated in August survey. On 1st day of every month you can get prompt to participate then day later results are published.",Neutral
AMD,1060 was a good uplift purely because 960 was a poor uplift over 760 + finally being able to move from 28nm -> 16nm process.,Positive
AMD,"So you're saying the cards like the 4070, 4070ti, 4090 are all trash cards because they're popular?",Negative
AMD,"Maybe in an alternative reality  AMD is an enthusiast brand that has no mainstream penetration but also doesn’t have a high end. Their target audience is a subset of the enthusiast crowd that trends young with limited income, while also simultaneously not having an actual low end either.   I’m sure you can tell how well that goes.",Neutral
AMD,"Im sure their interested but why would they spend the time, money, and effort when they dont have enough wafers to go around. So they stay relevant in GPU, lead in CPU, and compete in data centers where the real money is at. That way they can afford more R+D.",Neutral
AMD,Super themselves are not confirmed. All this are rumors and most of the pricing is drawn from a conclusion that 40 supers kept their MSRP as the original 40 series (in case of 4070S and 4070TiS),Neutral

There's always the classic iGPU excuse, but given how popular AMD CPUs are if it was truly a widespread issue we'd probably see AMD Radeon as the most popular singular block on the survey, and we don't.  The reality is that Nvidia dominates the prebuilt market and the VRAM debacles just aren't as important as people pretend it is. Likewise all those little features that people claim don't matter with Nvidia GPUs end up mattering to some degree. AMD spent years without a good DLSS competitor.

AMD,"And who was talking about the 4090 and 4070? Anyway, when the 4070 Super came out, it was an excellent card, perhaps the best on the market. If you buy a 12GB 5070 today, you're making a bad purchase... because it will become obsolete before a 9070, which is generally a bit faster and, more importantly, has more memory at a completely comparable price.  McDonald's GPUs are cards with 8GB of memory these days; the 5070, while not a card I'd recommend, isn't at that level.",Positive
AMD,"It's been the same excuse since Zen 2 era and they're on track for well over 30 billion revenue for 2025 and they still can't multi task.  Intel won't even double AMD's revenue this year (it was 10x that of AMD ten years ago) and they have a whole deadweight of a fab to power and paying for even more advanced TSMC nodes. Despite that fact they still somehow continue to be able to ""bribe OEMs to not use AMD"" (with negative cash flow three years in a row) and AMD can't afford to according to reddit.  AMD ten years ago at a fraction of the market cap and 1/6 the yearly revenue did better in getting their graphic cards in system integrators.

Well my i7-6850K that ran at 4.3GHz @ 1.425v for the past 10 years says otherwise...

Instead of trying to come up with reasons how that could possibly be real, just face the fact that 9070XT selling zero units is not possible.

AMD,"How much you notice Refresh rate does depend on what type of games you play along with what level of performance your rig can produce.  That said I'd be genuinely shocked if you really cant tell the difference at all between a 60Hz monitor and a 144Hz+ monitor. I'd be more inclined at that point to believe that something has been configured wrong and either the PC is stuck using the monitor in a locked 60Hz mode, or all the VSync settings for games were enabled and haven't been updated. Gotta check stuff like your GPU control panel for frame limits/power saving settings as well.",Neutral
AMD,"(make sure you actually have the higher refresh rate enabled in Windows and in the driver package. For some reason, that doesn't always enable by default)  (it's also worth remembering that not every panel is built the same and some of those just aren't very good at high refresh rate)",Neutral
AMD,> and i cant notice the higher refresh rate like at all  The difference in desktop usage alone is so big that going back to 60 after years of 120+ feels like it's lagging and I'd think even 144 will look like trash if you've sued a 360hz+ display for a long time.,Negative

AMD,"Yeah IDK where this idea that linux drivers have less effort put into them comes from. AMD rewrote almost the whole driver stack to get it included in the linux kernel and nvidia's main profit driver comes from datacenter now which is pretty much all linux, so their focus is heavily on linux drivers right now.

This was AMD's best opportunity in YEARS to make a dent in the NVIDIA mindshare and they failed by not being upfront about their own MSRP and availability. If AMD truly want to gain market share, they HAVE TO LOWER PRICES and take lower margins. AMD also has to compete across the whole stack, from the 6090 all the way down to the 6050.

AMD,This means that IF Intel has a great generation with Xe3 discrete GPU cards then it COULD make a significant dent in Nvidia's market share IF they have the right amount of supply  The B580 was a success beyond Intel's wildest dreams.  By the time the B580's launch the Xe graphics division was on **life support**  Xe3 discrete cards were likely canceled along with the B770 by the time of the B580 launch.  Conclusion:  **Intel badly misread the market and never thought the B580 would be a massive success. I.e. sell out on launch day**  Intel likely restarted Xe3 DGPU and B770 tape out and production after the massive success of the b580 launch  **That's why we do see leaks for Nova Lake A and AX big iGPU tiles in 2027 instead of any leaks about Xe3P Celestial cards and a 2026 launch for them**,Positive

It's in stock today, but it's also against two new GPU generations. Intel really needs to go all in on Celestial, it's not like there isn't a huge potential market just waiting for a good price/performance GPU offering out there across the entire performance range.",Negative
AMD,"Here's why Intel will never make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and why their situation is different to AMD/Radeon's.  1. Intel is basically an upstart in GPU, they have zero brand presence or mindshare to build off of. AMD on the other hand has Radeon which has been around for 20+ years. In fact the only thing gamers know about Intel's GPUs is their crappy Intel HD 3000 iGPUs that couldn't run games at playable frame rates. AMD doesn't have this issue.  2. Intel is slow to compete with NVIDIA. Look at Battlemage and how we're STILL waiting on the B770, it might not even release. People are not willing to wait for your product to release, if they want to upgrade, they will upgrade to what is available. AMD also doesn't have this issue, within a month or two, AMD was competing with Blackwell.  3. Intel had only bad press with ARC's initial launch, especially because of the drivers situation. Whilst Intel has tried to improve the drivers significantly and done a great job marketing Battlemage and the product even being solid, first impressions are hard to shake and had Alchemist had a better launch, Battlemage would have sold better. AMD doesn't really have this issue, they have for one or two gens but that was long ago and not anywhere close to the disastrous driver situation Intel's had. AMD drivers for the most part, might have a small issue in a few games on release, but they actually worked and were able to play games. Some games on Alchemist wouldn't even launch or run correctly.  4. Battlemage and Alchmeist doesn't compete across the stack. For what it's worth, only competing with basically the 4060 made Battlemage a sort of pointless generation because if you bought say an RTX 3060 years ago, it's not really an upgrade to buy a B580 or B570. Furthermore, if you have a 3070 or anything else, you literally cannot upgrade to a Battlemage card because it's a downgrade in performance. Competing across the whole stack is essential to getting sales and to convince people that your product is fast. This is probably the closest problem AMD has to Intel, but with RDNA3 they tried to compete across the whole stack, they just got destroyed.",Negative

The reality is that AMD doesn't supply enough chips as you said and secondarily that I do think that gamers think Radeon is the 'cheap' brand versus NVIDIA GeForce and they're not willing to spend within $200-$300 of the NVIDIA alternative because DLSS, NVIDIA broadcast, CUDA, the NVENC encoder and RT performance advantage are just too good to convince people to switch for the price that AMD is asking for.",Negative

Well AMD is in a unique position because they have more than one product segment to fall back on. NVIDIA lives or dies by GPU, if the GPU they produce is utter garbage and GPUs fall out of favor in the wider market, their entire product portfolio is at risk and their future.

Now with all the features expected, the cost of production, and AMD still having to use more expensive nodes/process to compete there is no way AMD can compete on price.  You saw this with how they reacted to RTX 50. They probably assumed they had a nice price set to compete only for NV to come in less than just about everyone expect sending AMD back to the drawing board and the end result was a product that they had to rebate to even honor the price they set. Now, they aren't even shipping in abundance to satisfy demand and thus reduce price.",Negative

AMD failed to respond to Maxwell and then Nvidia sealed AMD's fate with Pascal (AMD didn't respond to it either)  The Vega 56/64 was a joke compared to the GTX 1080 and especially the GTX 1080 ti   AMD finally released their massive uarch rework called RDNA in 2019, however it was too little, too late as Nvidia introduced RT and DLSS with Turing.

Meanwhile, AMD was not even matching said features 1:1 and introduced their own inferior versions.

Now we're at almost feature parity and AMD can't even muster the commitment to their products to ramp up production in a timely matter.

It was so bad that many developers complained publicly about this and of course Nvidia used the opportunity to ""help"" the developers instead. Sent their own engineers.

The B580 likely only survived because Intel already ordered 5nm wafers. Intel likely expected it to flop or at best have lukewarm reception.  B580 launch:   *Intel did not expect every single B580 to sell out on launch day and for the TREMENDOUS demand that followed.*  **Intel badly misread the market**   **Intel then likely hurriedly restarted Xe3P discrete GPU development and begun tape out of BMG-G31 (B770)**  *That's why we're seeing leaks about Nova Lake A and AX big iGPU tiles in 2027 but NOT Celestial DGPU'S in 2026*  *IF we get Xe3P DGPU's they will likely be using the same dies as the big iGPU's and they would likely come in 2027 or 2028*,Neutral

I know they make more than that now (and their iGPUs aren't even that bad... kinda) but it's a long association going way back to the early 2000s now.

AMD,"RDNA4 was already a huge leap in features though. FSR went from subpar vs DLSS 2 from 3.1 to beating DLSS 3 with FSR 4, RT performance significantly improved and is now half way towards matching GeForce vs where they started and FSR Redstone will come eventually for ray reconstruction and whatever equivalents.  Now yeah it's still sorta behind especially before Redstone comes but it's not the massive disparity they had during RDNA1, 2 or 3 anymore. Or what do they need an entire generation for the casuals to get it into their heads that FSR isn't bad vs DLSS anymore?  But I guess AMD has to push hard with RDNA5/UDNA to CLOSE the gap fully or very close to it, and then ideally really have great MSRPs and stick to those prices with good supply or else there'll be another wasted generation of low marketshare where only the console business and iGPUs really justifies continuing the R&D costs of new architectures. But I guess UDNA is supposed to make it so their server and business stuff contributes to gaming dev anyway by unifing them.   I do think RDNA4 could have still been selling well if AMD just produced lots of GPUs at MSRP, and maybe lower the the 9070's MSRP so it's undercutting the 5070. 9060 XT however isn't selling much it seems even though it's probably the best GPU in its price class, guess they needed to price match the 5060 with the 16GB model?

AMD,"Businesses who handle proprietary data sets and can't justify the costs of an entire server are using local machines, maybe that's a niche use case, but it's what I have experience with so that's what I drew on. I'll concede on that point, most LLMs are probably running on server hardware, not local.   I won't concede that 1/5 is a conservative estimate for DIY to prebuilt sales though. I'd say 1/10 is realistic if you look outside the US centric reddit hardware bubble. You have to remember that Internet cafes in Asia are extremely popular in densely populated cities where the average apartment doesn't have space for a gaming setup, and they buy prebuilts by the pallet. Maybe in the US it's 1/5, but the rest of the world is far more heavily skewed towards prebuilts.   The main point is I agree with you, AMD is never going to catch up with Nvidia in dGPU market share, anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, even in the main AMD sub this is the prevailing opinion. I would even go as far as to say AMD could make a 6090 killer next generation for $999, and their market share wouldn't increase by even a single point because there are so many consumers who mindlessly buy Nvidia or buy prebuilts/laptops which might as well be 100% Nvidia at this point.   Lowering prices did nothing for AMD in the past, and it won't change anything now. AMD will just change their wafer allocation to favor CPUs and still sell every GPU they make at current margins. Why bother when the Nvidia fans who cry for lower prices from AMD have shown time and time again that they will just wait for Nvidia to lower their prices before buying Nvidia like they always have? Lowering margin only hurts their R&D fund for the next generation.    The irony is that the real losers of this arrangement are GeForce fans, Nvidia has no incentive to produce outstanding gaming products when they're this far ahead. They can afford to lose a few generations and have their market share fall to a precipitous 90% before they start trying again, hell they can afford to lose the entire mid-range and budget markets permanently as long as they have their $2000 5090 marketing prop that only a fraction of people can afford.

Even when AMD was killing it with their 2600x, 3600x, 5600x, and then 5800x3d, my friends still said to me ""Why didn't you go Intel?"" not knowing that the 5800x3d was the best gaming CPU at the time.  If it's not out in-front of customers on the shelves, then people don't have any idea to research it.",Neutral
AMD,"The issue is that Nvidia does so many software offerings that a lot of people also get locked in because AMD didn't have an equivalent. I'd argue AMD didn't have an actual competitor to DLSS2 until FSR4, several years later. The existence of opticaler with FSR4 means that I don't really consider upscaling as part of my buying patterns anymore but for the past 5 years? Yeah they did.  It's also been years and there still isn't an AMD equivalent to RTX HDR, RTX VSR and DLDSR for example.

AMD,"> Businesses who handle proprietary data sets and can't justify the costs of an entire server are using local machines, maybe that's a niche use case  Niche case I'd say. Hiring a Linode instance or something like that for a couple hours or a week is way more cost effective than going out and buying a whole new set of hardware, especially just for experimenting and seeing if a LLM or AI model is feasible for their business or to prototype one they're making etc.  Or perhaps just outsourcing to another company on a subscription-based model with hundreds or thousands of clients who maybe tailor their LLM or AI model for certain clients and their data. I've had my cousin's law firm go out and get AI assistants and I suggested he setup an instance tailored to his firm. But the firm did some digging and found a local company who just has hundreds of AI assistants that they lease out on a subscription model and who tailor their AI assistants to a specific style of business and they customise it so it knows who the people are at the business, the business name, emails go to specific business accounts etc. It was a few thousand a year to use this AI assistant company, but the firm don't have to troubleshoot or maintain it and you get free included bi-annual performance upgrades for the hardware that's running the model, and obviously they update the model too and make tweaks after they do testing to see if they can deploy the model to their clients. In the end, it's just a secretarial replacement really, so all the model needs to do is basic stuff like note down the name and number, who the person wants to talk to and forward emails. Nothing too crazy or extensive. So maybe this is a basic scenario.  Either way, I don't think it's feasible to go out and buy bare metal hardware, especially for a small business. And any large business it's probably better for them to go to Amazon or Google or Microsoft and setup some huge datacenter to do whatever AI thing they want for some multi-million dollar deal.  > I won't concede that 1/5 is a conservative estimate for DIY to prebuilt sales though. I'd say 1/10 is realistic if you look outside the US centric reddit hardware bubble.  I just spitballed a number. It could be 1/10th as you said or even 1/20th etc. In the end, it's significant still for DIY, certainly millions in revenue that you shouldn't ignore it if you're NVIDIA or AMD. Plus DIY buyers tend to be the most loyal customers, so if you win their heart or mind, they're likely to return. In my experience, prebuilt buyers tend to just go where the value is because quality is usually subpar anyways in that market segment.  > You have to remember that Internet cafes in Asia are extremely popular in densely populated cities where the average apartment doesn't have space for a gaming setup, and they buy prebuilts by the pallet. Maybe in the US it's 1/5, but the rest of the world is far more heavily skewed towards prebuilts.  I mean most netcafes I know of in Asia don't buy pre-builts from an OEM like Dell or HP or something, most of them go to a local builder in one of those huge techmalls and puts in an order for 3-4 machine types/tiers but hundreds of units. i.e basic office, then basic gamer, then moderate gamer and then like high end gamer rigs. They put in an order of 1,000 PCs and they might buy 100 office PCs, 300 basic gamer ones, then 500 moderate gamer ones and then 100 high end gamer ones to have different tiers in their cafe. But they're all DIY rigs really, just from a local techmall shop who cranks them out and services/warranties them. I've never seen an asian netcafe buy an HP or Dell prebuilt in years and things like iBUYPOWER or Origin PC aren't really popular in Asia as the DIY prebuilt market is huge there and it's all local small shops vying for business. At least that's my experience from when I used to live in Taiwan. The last time I saw like a netcafe use prebuilts, like proper HP or Dell OEM ones was the early 2000s and it was usually smaller cafes that didn't really cater to gamers.  > The main point is I agree with you, AMD is never going to catch up with Nvidia in dGPU market share, anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional, even in the main AMD sub this is the prevailing opinion.  I wouldn't say thats the prevailing opinion over there, maybe the slight majority, but a lot of them are still believing that it's 2008 and the only reason AMD is behind NVIDIA is because of some marketing campaign or behind doors deals, rather than AMD's own lack of prioritising dGPU.  > I would even go as far as to say AMD could make a 6090 killer next generation for $999, and their market share wouldn't increase by even a single point because there are so many consumers who mindlessly buy Nvidia or buy prebuilts/laptops which might as well be 100% Nvidia at this point.  I don't think so. I think they could make a 6090 killer for $999, the problem is will they supply enough to make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and considering how intent AMD is on using TSMC, I don't think that will happen. It all goes back to AMD insisting on using TSMC, they need to diversify their foundry and if they want to take marketshare it might mean going to Samsung for your dGPU gaming products and getting cheaper but lower performance silicon to undercut NVIDIA. It won't happen because AMD probably doesn't want to ruin their CPU dominance and their relationship with TSMC is too important, so they will continue with TSMC. But also because AMD is moving to UDNA for dGPU, which means they are pretty much forced to having a unified architecture on one node, which now limits their foundry options. If they choose a foundry ALL their graphics products have to use it and I very much doubt AMD wants their professional stuff nor their consoles to use Samsung or Intel foundry.  > The irony is that the real losers of this arrangement are GeForce fans, Nvidia has no incentive to produce outstanding gaming products when they're this far ahead.  Absolutely agree on that. But on the other hand, the NVIDIA fan doesn't have much of a choice anyway because they were always going to buy NVIDIA. The absolute losers in their scenario are the people like myself or maybe even you who move between Radeon and NVIDIA and just pick the best hardware option at the time. In the end, if Radeon's not willing to fight NVIDIA and make the best thing possible, then buying NVIDIA is the only real option consumers have because it's sadly the best product available.",Neutral
AMD,"> They're not in the survey because they get reported as integrated graphics if you're not on Linux.  Total lie.

What the market did with that is up to the market, and that’s why I consider this fuck around and find out mode.  Good value compared to poor value. Like I said it's all relative. But honestly the 9070 XT has a fake MSRP anyways.  > Obviously we can each have an opinion on who’s offering the better deal  Objectively AMD would be offering the better deal if they could actually meet their supposed MSRP.  > but I think it’s pretty amusing that you think AMD is out there to “help” anyone.  I never claimed AMD was doing something to ""help"" people, I used the word ""help"" not literally, but rather to explain something does not ""help"" a situation. It's like saying ""If the Government doesn't collect taxes, it doesn't help them provide roads for citizens"". I don't mean it in the literal sense that AMD is there to help consumers directly or something like that. Just merely by pricing stuff so high it doesn't help the situation.  > That will never be the point of any product that they release, because “helping” the consumer is inversely proportional to profit, and that’s a relationship that’s extremely easy to maintain in a duopoly.

AMD,"We have 3 sources of valuable data that all pretty much refute Mindfactory numbers (or any AMD-heavy leaning outlet).  - Steam Survey: Shows volunteer user metrics. Whether you want to plug your ears and say ""AMD is misreported"" doesn't change the abysmal growth of AMD branded products. This correlates with: - JPR Numbers: Show that data collected from distributors reveals the anemic amount of units AMD is shipping. AMD ships 6 units to every 94 NV units. This correlates with the Steam Survey abysmal growth of AMD branded products. - AMD/NV Financial Reports: Show that NV's Gaming section (which only monitors GeForce products, so no Switch/Switch2 inclusion) dwarves AMD's Gaming section (which does include consoles, such as Xbox and it's variants and Playstation and it's variants) to the magnitude that NV's Gaming numbers dwarf AMD's enterprise numbers (that should tell you ALOT).  The end result is 3 data sources that would tell anyone with reading comprehension that there is absolutely no way for AMD to outsell NV outside of niche situations where the vendor is allocating more AMD products than NV, and even that would be a drop in the hat compared to the sheer volume NV floods the market with.  Even if NV only allocates 10% of their shipments to DIY markets, that's still 9 to 6, AMD would have to have 100% sale thru to beat NV only having 66% sale thru, and we all know that isn't happening.

Still doesn't change my original point was that I haven't heard HUB mention anything about how RDNA4 sales would've remained competitive with Nvidia since launch.  RDNA4 having good availability on launch day (almost entirely due to the postponement) and HUB arguing that RDNA4 sales have remained competitive with Blackwell are 2 different things.

I think they simply don't really care to follow up or their sources aren't very good, but even still, each market is different. In NA, Asia and China, NVIDIA tends to be a big seller.

DLSS has been around a long time and is very well supported, AMD need to be way more bullish with FSR4 integration in games because it looks fantastic, I couldn't really see the difference in motion between DLSS 3 that I was using previously on my 3070, and FSR 4 on my 9070 XT, and I noticed the artifacts from FSR 3.1 pretty easily.   If they can keep pushing FSR closer to DLSS (which I'm hopeful for given it ties directly into their plans to push instinct products for the far more lucrative data centre market) and keep up similar gains in price to performance to what we got with RDNA4 coming from the rather lukewarm RDNA3, I think they will be a pretty attractive option for me personally, even if I don't think it will improve the market share situation much if at all.",Positive

I said simply that if it were true that RDNA4 was selling well, it would be on the Steam HW Survey main page. It is so low in terms of sales that you have to go beyond the main page to find it and I showed you how.  Then you made out like it's not there because it's because of some reporting error that it's not on the Steam HW Survey because it in your fantasy world reports as ""Integrated Graphics"". [I literally told you how to see the 9070 series on the Steam HW Survey and it shows up correctly, the numbers are just insanely low.](https://old.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1n70kxx/jpr_q225_pc_graphics_addin_board_shipments/ncatylg/)  > It literally reports as integrated graphics outside of Linux lol  [It literally doesn't.](https://i.imgur.com/WO8Z4sD.png) I told you how to show it beyond the main page.

When talking about price, popularity is really all that matters especially when the only complaints about price are generalised ""everything is too expensive"" rather than actually comparing like products on the market at the same time.",Negative
AMD,"Well yes and no. The issue is online reviewers are detached from what people generally see as being a worthwhile amount to pay for a GPU and in that regard, the merit is worthless. The quibble with reviewers isn't over whether they think a certain tier of GPU is too expensive; they argue everything is too expensive (clearly this is not the case).",Negative

It's disingenuous to make out it's a disaster, from this data at least.",Negative
AMD,"A direct comparison between sales of the mid range cards gen on gen would get a more accurate representation of where they are (at this stage of release). AMD are claiming they can't keep up with demand. I'm arguing that AI usage with high end nvidia cards will have boosted their market share in desktop gpu's. It's no secret Nvidia have been directing people towards the 5090 with pricing too so even those with modest ambitions in those areas will be heading to the top of the tree, of which AMD hasn't even a card.",Neutral

I wouldn't call 705 cards on launch day at a large retailer in one city like Dallas which has a population of 1.3 million ""high availability on launch day"". Within 10 minutes they all sold.

I always try to say, 'don't attribute their opinion to malice, but maybe they're genuinely time poor or don't know about something and maybe they need to be made aware of it'. This seemed to be the case with the AM5 ASRock board situation where Steve from HUB thought the issue was sorted and I believe that's what he thought/had happened to him, until he was made aware of the issue still persisting. Thus, his opinion changed.  Maybe after benchmarking every day, they simply don't have the time or want to touch anything to do with tech.

Markets aren't always efficient, and gaming GPUs are a perfect example of that. Consumers don't always act in their own interests, and gaming GPUs are again a perfect example of that. This is a market with effectively a single monopolistic supplier and the YT channels are correct that the product is heavily over priced.

AMD,"AMD's lost marketshare - if caused by their lack of supply - is 100% their fault for failing to meet that supply. Nvidia is outselling AMD 15-1. The 5090 outselling every RDNA4 SKU is a major problem for AMD.   And they can argue that they're struggling with demand, but their sequential sales figures have remained flat quarter-over-quarter.   If AI was the main leading factor than 1) AMD really dropped the ball because AI support for their cards is still horrible. Go see how many hoops people need to jump through to run something on an AMD card that just works on Nvidia, and 2) AI doesnt explain why 5070 outselling 9070. 5060 outselling 9060, etc.",Negative
AMD,"> I watched your video and at 18:30 they say that Microcenter had nearly 20x more RDNA4 cards on launch day than they did Blackwell, literally proving my point.  Firstly, that's one retailer in one region. It doesn't prove ANYTHING about whether more RDNA4 shipped than Blackwell. I mean we can just see from Steam HW survey and JPR numbers that NVIDIA shipped way more stock in both Q1 and Q2 than RDNA4. So whilst Microcenter may not have gotten them or even maybe NA was neglected by NVIDIA, NVIDIA still shipped more cards to people on the whole. Again... your whole point was AMD was somehow masterful by delaying their launch so they could build up stock, yet the numbers do not reflect your theory. In Europe for instance there was barely any stock as evidenced by that same video. So AMD only cared to divert stock to NA and made other regions suffer.  Secondly, I wrote a whole lot and you NEVER answered it. So I'll try again. My whole point was you were trying to say that RDNA4 was smart to delay its launch so it could stockpile units, correct? Except that you also then said that there was only 3 weeks left in the quarter so that's why the Q1 RDNA4 numbers were disappointing.  So what is it?:  1. That RDNA4 had high volume and was smart to delay so they could stockpile lots of stock?  2. Or was it that it was an anemic launch that doesn't reflect in Q1 numbers because there was only three weeks left in Q1?  Choose.  > The fake MSRP is easily explained by AMD lying.

Aggressive pricing on the 5070 had them delay release and ""cut"" the price to $599. Launch cards then launched for the price they were always planning to launch for.  AMD simply made out like the MSRP was $599 by giving AIBs grants/kickbacks/allowances (whatever you want to call it) for selling a cheaper model at that MSRP on launch day for a limited run of units.  Regardless, this is all one big distraction. I still need you to answer the above question. Please answer it.  > Your own source claims Microcenter had 11,600 RDNA4 cards on launch day and 500 Blackwell cards on launch day.  Again, one retailer in one region. In other regions like China there were floods of Blackwell on launch day, entire warehouses stacked. By contrast AMD had little stock in Europe for RDNA4.  > And according to your own video, that's more cards at one retailer than Microcenter had 5090s and 5080s combined at every one of their stores combined.

At the end of the day, we're all human and we make mistakes. But just see their responses to proper criticism.  ""I didn't know!"" sure, but then you double down! Sometimes triple down! This hurts your credibility and ""I didn't know"" eventually should lose all value.  There data is downright questionable due to settings they use. It renders some of their data effectively useless outside of this specific setup that I'd argue 99% of users won't ever find themselves in such as disabling DLSS (this isn't a HUB specific complaint either).  At this point after consuming their content I 100% will attribute their position/opinions to malice. You can't walk way from any of their conclusions or actual commentary during their videos and not take it they have an AMD bias. The irony is 100% recommending AMD to most of their audience while they rock NV hardware (that is likely free for them).  EDIT: a recent example for Pro-AMD. During their blacklisting debacle they stood the line (likely only because it was against NV) and openly declared they will not be a mouth piece for a manufacturer. Fast forward to the 8GB debacle, and they refused to test the 8GB cards at 1080p because ""they said they were 1440p products""  Which is it - are you a mouth piece or not?

Instead they picked games with anemic RT features when RDNA2 rolled around and called it ""AMD caught up, in fact they are even better look at these Metro numbers!""

My argument is more coherent because all I need to argue is ""the right price is whatever the seller and buyer both agree on under supply and demand; since this is a luxury product where people are under no real duress to buy a product they otherwise wouldn't need"".

Then we can then make a judgement on how RDNA4 is.  They don't give a shit about AI because they're knocking it out the park with their CPU's so silicon is already at a premium. They don't need to even bother trying to compete & potentially wasting money in that area. I still think their cards are still too expensive btw. I'm not saying they're completely innocent.

AMD,Alright thanks!,Positive
AMD,i need new cpu because in dota2 12v12 i experience some lag and fps drop to 60 or lower,Negative
AMD,"14600K has same number of P cores as 12400f tho. Do you really think the extra e cores will solve the lag? Have you looked at the Task Manager while this lag is happening? Be sure to right click graph and show all logical CPU cores.   You might throw Task Manager up on second display so you can see it while gaming. You might also try playing with only one display connected. Sometimes a graphics card might struggle to run two displays simultaneously in some situations when the refresh rates are dramatically different. Not sure whether that's the case here, but if you haven't tried it, you won't know for certain.  If it is somehow GPU quirk, you may solve it by running one display off the iGPU but you are using F version without iGPU, so that is not option for you. You should also check whether game is set to full screen or full screen windowed because that might have impact, too. And update your AMD drivers. All the basics.  I think you should do a bit more testing before you conclude you need to throw cash at it. 14600K is a great value with discount tho.",Neutral
AMD,"If you can get a 12700K or 12900K really cheaply (used?) then should help a bit, but otherwise, yeah, go AMD Zen 4 or later, ideally the 9800X3D, it will be a hefty jump in CPU performance for you.",Neutral
AMD,"14600K is a solid upgrade not that hard to cool, especially while gaming. I’d go with that personally.",Positive
AMD,"I tried everything, my last gou is 3070ti and i change gpu theres no difference in playing cs2 and dota2. No increase fps. So ineed new cpu",Negative
AMD,14600k almost same price and with free bf6 game,Neutral
AMD,"Intel 13th and 14th gen have degradation issues, it's on a dead platform, where the 9800X3D is much better and has upgradeability. Also, BF6 only counts if you were going to spend money in it anyway. If you don't care about that game then the game has zero value.  No, getting LGA1700 is a bad idea, except where you can get a really good deal as a temporary thing, and are going to upgrade later to Zen 6 or Intel Nova Lake in a couple years anyway.",Negative
AMD,"For 1080p/1440p, 7800X3D plus 7800XT is essentially the sweet spot.  Strong multitasking, excellent gaming, and not overkill like a 9 series.  You'll be set if you add an Arctic Liquid Freezer III (LCD) to the cooler.",Neutral
AMD,"The AIO is pure aesthetics on a 7800X3D, you can cool that thing with the stock cooler from a 2700X, so whatever looks best for you. A 9070 XT would be a better buy than a 7800XT as well; coincidentally I have the Steel Legend 9070 XT version of the 7800XT you have there, I love it.  However, you're also building your PC half a year from now. You can do some initial planning now, sure, but the hardware landscape *is* going to be different in five months. Do more focused part-targeting then.",Positive
AMD,"awesome, thank you for the input og",Positive
AMD,"my plan was to honestly try and scoop whateve ri could for a discount around black friday/cyber monday so i wasnt sure how much would change by then - ik new tech comes out in the fall, but still - cant imagine the newest gen stuff would change my plans too much in that sense",Neutral
AMD,That is the same setup as my son. Perfectly fine for 1080p gaming.,Positive
AMD,"It’s pretty good for 1080p gaming, wouldn’t buy that cpu or gpu brand new tho.",Positive
AMD,it depends     what u want to play,Neutral
AMD,I'm confused. Do you already have this computer? Shouldn't you know already if you're satisfied with the experience you're getting from it? If you are why would you care about what random strangers on the internet think.   My advice would be to spend less time on the internet and more time enjoying games! Gear envy causes us to spend so much money unnecessarily.,Negative
AMD,I am using the same CPU+GPU combo. It hold up pretty well. I recently played Mafia: The Old Country and Cronos: The New Dawn perfectly (setting needed to be tweaked a bit) and it's the perfect 1080p combo for me. No complain at all.,Positive
AMD,"Yes and No.   It deoends on what you are playing, on what resolution, framerate etc. etc.   If you play esports titles at 1080, some even at 1440p sure.   Super highend triple A titles could struggle with that setup.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on the games you want to play and at what settings, if you don't mind lowering settings on the newer highend games then that setup holds up no problem. Got a family member i build a PC a long time ago sitting on a very similar hardware only difference is he got a worse gpu in a 1660 super, where yours is better. And i recently reinstalled his machine and put in new thermal paste... it still runs soo smooth and can play anything he needs it to these days.  Is the cpu an ""x"" model or none ""x"" If it is an x model then enabling PBO settings can give it a little bit of a boost.   Either way, if you are planning on upgrading at some point, then wait for AM6 to release instead of going with an AM5",Neutral
AMD,"cpu, ram, gpu, and psu are from your previous build?  You upgraded… the motherboard? Did the old one break?",Neutral
AMD,I'd get a 5700X/X3D if you can for a decent price;,Neutral
AMD,Should be fine for 7th & 8th gen gaming at 1080p but you'll probably need to upgrade if you ever want to do 9th gen(& eventually 10 gen) gaming at 1440p or better.,Neutral
AMD,Runs tons of stuff at 1080p.  This is similar to one of my daughters PCs.  You have room to upgrade to a 5600x or and x3d CPU for a big performance boost.,Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn't call it good by today's standards, but it's not horrible.    Should be alright for 1080p gaming if you don't mind medium/low settings in certain games.",Positive
AMD,"try to find a 5500x3d if you can, as long as its below 200 bucks good upgrade for your CPU   gpu, its fine... I would wait until end of year, easy upgrade would be a 9060xt 156gb  besides that... its a good build for 1080p, like you can also wait and upgrade in 2 years when consoles drop if the games you care about are running fine",Positive
AMD,Maybe just upgrade your ram but you're fine. I've got a 6600xt trucking along myself so long as the game isn't unoptimized as all hell it runs fine.,Positive
AMD,This is exactly what I have with my 1440p monitor. Still working through my backlog so haven’t had a reason to upgrade yet. Has been able to handle everything I’ve thrown at it so far,Neutral
AMD,"In the near future, you can upgrade to a ryzen 5600 refurbished (dirty cheap) and then upgrade the gpu to the AMD 10 series. FSR4 looks like the real deal, finally AMD figured things out, so it's the perfect chance to jump",Positive
AMD,"Are you saying you’re just upgrading the motherboard? If you’re doing that, I’d get a new CPU as well at least so you wont need to buy a new motherboard *again* when you need to upgrade the CPU",Neutral
AMD,"Eventually you can get a 5700x3d but I believe am4 x3d chips are ending production. That GPU eventually you can upgrade for probably cheap if you get a 40/50 series card or eventually an AMD when their new cards come out.  But if it plays what you like, no need to upgrade",Neutral
AMD,"It wont be an amazing experience, but there are certainly lots of games it can play at good settings and framerate, especially older titles",Positive
AMD,"I went from ryzen 3600 to 5700x3d and had massive jumps in average FPS. My GPU is a 3060ti and I play in 1440p, get about 70-100fps in Helldivers 2 for instance.",Neutral
AMD,"My son had something similar, recently upgraded his 3600 to a 5900x (neither of us is paying these nutty x3d prices!). His 3060ti died so he is currently running an old 5500xt, but thinking of saving for a 9060xt in the near future",Negative
AMD,"In 2020, I had a similar build with Ryzen 3600 and RTX 2070 Super (roughly similar to RX 6600).   Last year, during Black Friday Sales, I upgraded the CPU to 5700x3d for about $120 (USD) (including shipping). I had a feeling that those good prices won't last long.   Then, early this year, I upgraded the GPU to RTX 5060Ti 16GB. Probably overpay $50 for it.   Since my monitor only runs 75Hz at 1440p and I don't use Ultra settings, the upgrades were more than adequate and will last me for quite a while.",Positive
AMD,"A friend of mine has a similar (R5 5600 instead) build and it struggles in brand new releases like Oblivion Remastered. Needs to use mods to disable the forced UE5 Ray Tracing to be playable. In general this GPU will struggle with UE5 games, which are 90% of AAA releases nowadays.",Negative
AMD,I bought them in 2022.,Neutral
AMD,"Fortnite, TLOU, Helldivers, and some newly released games.",Neutral
AMD,"I don’t really understand the question then, just lookup the games you want to play and see videos of your cpu and gpu combo performance before buying.",Neutral
AMD,"Helldivers may struggle. Super CPU heavy and not optimized very well. Also new AAA titles will be a little rough, but 1080 should be semi okay.",Negative
AMD,I play helldivers 2 in 1080p on a marginally better rig and normally it does fine. I probably average around 100fps. I say normally because helldivers is kinda broken atm.,Neutral
AMD,He is asking what upgrades he should get in the future,Neutral
AMD,I built my PC in 2019 with a R5 3600 and upgraded the gpu to a  2060 Super and Helldivers ran great. but i would agree the NEW AAA games are iffy maybe low-med.,Positive
AMD,Probably something newer,Neutral
AMD,">ran great  Key word being ""ran"", it's pretty bad these days with optimization unfortunately. I love the game, but it needs some love in that department.",Negative
AMD,yeah i made a new rig up until about a month ago (last time i played on it and it was Expedition 33 on med). my gf has it and she's able to play games on it,Neutral
AMD,"Helldivers and BF6 are very CPU-heavy games so that will for sure be your bottleneck. I'd look for a used 5800X3D, since a new 5700X3D is likely not worth. A full AM5 upgrade would be ideal though - maybe consider this instead of a GPU upgrade if BF/helldivers are your main games. GTX 1080 should still be able to play those just fine even at 1440p but an AM5 CPU will push your frames higher esp at low settings",Neutral
AMD,"If it's just for gaming, the 5950X wouldn't be worth getting over like a 5700X or 5800XT.",Negative
AMD,"Are you having issues with your CPU? Are there situations where it's holding you back? Are you noticing that your CPU is lacking in any situations?   The most logical route would be to upgrade GPU if you want more performance, then concern yourself with issues if you actually notice any.  Any of the 5000 X3D CPUs would likley be your best bet if you want to upgrade without need a new mobo and RAM.",Negative
AMD,"The cheapest of these three will be a solid upgrade- 5700x, 5800x, 5800xt.  How much are 9070’s or 5070’s in your area? Idk about spending that much on a 7800xt.",Neutral
AMD,The best bang for buck upgrade is probably a relatively cheap AM5 board with a 7600X and 32 GB DDR5 - it will give you a platform for a massive upgrade to Zen 6 later even if you don't do that second upgrade until years from now.  Otherwise only something like a used 5800X3D or 5700X3D is really worth it.  A used 5800X if found for extremely cheap might be worthwhile but I would probably still skip over that for one of the above choices.,Positive
AMD,Is there much of a gain over the 3800x? The 5700x looks about 10% better but 160 euro. The 5800 looks marginally better than that but around 210 euro.,Neutral
AMD,"I do think I need to spend a bit more time monitoring the CPU usage. I've been having some performance issues since I reinstalled windows and flashed my bios but those issues could be anything. I only realized that I hadn't renabled xmp profile on the mobo, so was running the RAM at a slower speed...   Thanks for the advice, I've been thinking the same too, to just upgrade the GPU and see how things are after.",Negative
AMD,Is there much between those cpus in terms of performance? They all look similar on the benchmarks.   9070 is about 670 on amazon. 5070 is about 580.,Neutral
AMD,"Pretty similar 8 core CPU’s, just get the cheapest.  Price kinda sucks for the 9070. For 30-80 more I would get the 5070 over the 7800xt all day.",Negative
AMD,"I didn't really look at the 5070 much with the lower VRAM. I don't play single player games on the PC so I don't care much for ray tracing, so I just kinda ignored Nvidia cards this time around!",Negative
AMD,"Do you have a link to that specific motherboard's support website? I can only find the A520M-ITX/ac, unless you meant that's what you have.",Neutral
AMD,"As I am currently having the same problem, I found this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/190w1sm/a520mitxac\_with\_a\_5700g\_no\_video\_no\_beeps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/190w1sm/a520mitxac_with_a_5700g_no_video_no_beeps/)  Apparently they found the BIOS beeing the problem. As far as I understand, as a solution, the person bought an older Ryzen (3600), flashed the BIOS with that mobo (so I guess with that CPU it just naturally worked), and then it worked with a 5700. Maybe that helps you.  However, I am running into the same issue with a Ryzen 3700 and I'm just as confused as it should work naturally.  I did try different screens, cables, with and w/o GPU, swapped ram, .... all the good stuff. Afraid I will need to get an even older CPU to make it work but it sounds so counter intuitive to me. A bummer I alsready sold my old MB",Negative
AMD,"Yeah sorry that's a typo on my part, it's the ITX/ac",Neutral
AMD,"So after testing with my other rig, while removing I realized that while my previous MB had a POWER_CPU the new had none, so I checked and you need to put either a 4- or 8-pin atx plug in the ATX12V1 port (near I/O output). It worked like a charm with proper BIOS version",Neutral
AMD,"Your bios version should support that CPU, so that's likely not the issue, at least.  What exact ram did you buy? Have a link?  What monitor are you using? Do you have any others you could try?",Neutral
AMD,"This is the ram I'm using https://www.mini-itx.com/~32GB-DDR4-3200-DIMM   With it's datasheet (from serial number on ram) :   https://www.kingston.com/dataSheets/KVR32N22D8_32.pdf   The monitor is functionnal, as I've used it to check the hdmi cable with a laptop I had lying around. I have no other monitor around",Neutral
AMD,Do you have any other ram you could try?,Neutral
AMD,"I have some in my main computer that I can probably slot out to try, I'll update you.",Neutral
AMD,"Ok, I've got this one lying around, Corsair DDR4 16Gb 3200MHz (https://www.corsair.com/fr/fr/p/memory/cmk16gx4m1e3200c16/vengeancea-lpx-16gb-1-x-16gb-ddr4-dram-3200mhz-c16-memory-kit-black-cmk16gx4m1e3200c16) I've tried on both ram slots and none of them work I've checked on the MB datasheet and it's supposed to accept this size, speed and type of ram",Neutral
AMD,You tried both the original RAM and this one in both slots?,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, both the 16 and the 32 (each time only one of course) lead to no output in either ram slot. I'll try to get my hands on a DP cable but I don't see how only the output port would be an issue",Negative
AMD,"It's less likely a ram issue if two different sticks did not work.  It could be mobo, CPU or possibly PSU, but hard to narrow down unless you can swap in replacement components to test or swap the CPU to another system.",Neutral
AMD,"Ok thanks for your help I'll contact the supplier on my side. The PSU should work, I used it before (3 days ago) to power a raspberry pi with way too many attachement and I tested it using a multimeter. I've got another cpu on hand that I tried on the system (Ryzen 3 3200G, not supported for bios under v3.40) and I've got the same issue. I'll try a display port and if all else fail, try to scavenge an old gpu. I'll edit the post and answer with a summary of what I tried so at least it won't go to waste",Neutral
AMD,"So I'm the stupid one, I missed the ATX12V1 power plug needed to actually put power to the CPU because, well, didn't read the doc correctly and my last build was far too long ago so I forgot you had to put piwer to the cpu from another thing than the 24-pin atx connector. Everything is working fine now. Thanks a lot for your patience",Negative
AMD,"Is it worth upgrading? Well ultimately thats up to you, but ill give a reason as to why you should or shouldnt.  Yes: Not only will you see am immense improvement in performance with an AM5 cpu (especially with the 7800X3D), but moving to AM5 motherboard opens you up to future cpu upgrades. Whereas with an AM4 motherboard, you're stuck to using AM4 cpu's.  No: Ultimately at the end of the day whether or not you should upgrade should be determined on whether or not you need to. If you're happy and content with the performance that you're getting now, than imo even though a 7800X3D would provide you with a huge jump in performance, I wouldnt do it.",Neutral
AMD,"It depends on what is limiting your performance in games, and it may vary depending on whether or not the game is CPU heavy and your resolution and quality settings. Test the games you play and see for yourself.  CPU bottleneck will be less the higher the resolution in most cases.

AMD,"On fhd, yes, you will see somewhere like 15% ~ 25% better performance. On 4k, the difference is marginal.",Neutral
AMD,"Won’t be a huge difference between the 76 and 78 with your ultrawide. Get the 76 bundle with 32gb Corsair ram, no need to pay extra for the upgraded mobo. $450 for the 76, Corsair ram, and tuf mobo is a solid deal.",Positive
AMD,Since you cant swap parts between bundles id go with the AMD one. Those Intel Ultra cpus are kinda ass.,Negative
AMD,"Do you only game? Or would you be using this for professional work / creative apps / AI, etc?  If only gaming, #1. If more, #2.  Edit: Nevermind, since borderlands makes it the same price, just get #2. The 265k will last a long time, it's unlikely you'll ever have to upgrade it.",Neutral
AMD,"I would go #2 since you're buying Borderlands 4 anyway.  1's CPU is arguably better, but it only matters more than the GPU at 1080p. If you plan on playing 1440p or above, I'd take the 5070ti.   And it's not really ""AMD better than intel"", you compare them per chip. 9700x and 265k have very similar gaming performance and 265k is better at productivity. That being said, you will have the option to upgrade the Ryzen to a 9800x3d if you want to down the road, and you won't really have good upgrade options for the intel unless you replace the whole board.  TLDR if you plan to upgrade the CPU down the road get the first one, if you don't get the second.",Positive
AMD,Can you get the 9700x with the 5070ti? That would be the best option,Positive
AMD,"Yeah thats why im hesitent, since i want the ryzen cpu, and the 5070 ti",Neutral
AMD,Is the diffrence between the 5070 ti and the 9070 xt greater than the u7 265k and ryzen 7 9700x?,Neutral
AMD,"No unfortunately not, I can't edit the ""pack list"". I could build the 9700x with the 5070 ti, but then i wouldnt get the discount and it would cost like 300$ extra if you take away  the z890 for b650 aswell",Negative
AMD,"That future upgrade path is a nice thing to have in your back pocket. If AMD stays true to their word, then AM5 is hopefully here for a while.    The GPUs trade blows, but that Intel CPU isnt anyones first choice for a gaming cpu",Positive
AMD,They all trade blows. Side by side I doubt you'd notice a difference between the two systems.  What you get with Nvidia is a more complete/mature feature set in stuff ***other*** than gaming.  What you get with AM5 is a future upgrade path for the CPU.,Neutral
AMD,"I agree, ive had a Ryzen 5 1600x and 1070 for the past 8 years so i quite like the nvidia and amd combo.",Neutral
AMD,"you can get a similar performing Thermalright single tower cooler for $20ish, or a much better performing dual tower for $35ish",Neutral
AMD,"It's great but Win11 is the way now.  Cooler and tower are both on the expensive side but if you like them it's fine, your overall budget will go down by like 5% here if you optimize since they are not high price items.",Positive
AMD,"There are better priced good psu out there, even at that same wattage. That's my only thing with it",Neutral

AMD,> AMD Radeon Rx 9060 XT Gpu  Brand doesn't matter all that much. VRAM capacity DOES. Make sure you get the 16GB version.,Neutral
AMD,Just get the cheapest with a 3 year warranty. I just learned recently that sapphire only offers 2 year warranty’s on their more basic cards. I would recommend a different brand if they’re the cheapest. XFX makes solid cards as well.,Neutral
AMD,"Get whichever brand is cheapest. The only slight differences is thermals and loudness.  For the best value for your buck, I would get the SAPPHIRE PULSE.",Positive
AMD,get the cheapest that isnt asus,Neutral
AMD,"The major difference is how they look.  Performance wise they have to meet the same specs so performance out of the box is generally about the same.  Also three fan models tend to have better thermals, but are larger.",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe get a 3 fan version instead of 2 fan - 3 fans usually have better cooling performance, and run a bit quieter.   It's not true for each and every card, but as a general rule it should be like that.",Neutral
AMD,All shit take whatever is cheapest,Negative
AMD,"The only thing that will change is heat / noise profile and pcb, ideally you want the best pcb for the cheapest.   Frequency will also change but all cards will OC similar.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD has better bang-for-buck, but worse super sampling/ray tracing. Nvidia has DLSS, but loves to make 8gb traps that will be outdated in a year.",Negative
AMD,"Unless if you're on an extreme budget, I don't recommend the cheapest card. I used to have a cheap basic model of a card and I learned the hard way what happens when you go for the cheapest model: gets too damn hot and thermal throttles. I'd personally pay extra for better thermals. The difference between my 3070 Ti and 5070 Ti is absolutely amazing. Old card where I used to sit at 90C, I now sit at 68C (meanwhile people on cheapest models of the 5070 Tis complain of heat). And my PC is so much quieter.

AMD,"It will definitely be fine the 9060XT is only a 170w card. My last gpu was a Sapphire Pulse and I had no problems with it  My 9060XT is a XFX and it works great, I would have got the Sapphire Pulse but I had a coupon for Best Buy and they don't carry Sapphire gpus",Positive
AMD,"I'm not that knowledgeable on AMD cards, but the Sapphire Pulse is a really cheap card. More likely not than not, not offering the best thermals. It's a two fan card meanwhile they make three fan versions of the GPU and with better heatsinks. Just looking at it, it's not going to offer the best thermals. The card will absolutely turn on and work, but it's more likely to thermal throttle and reduce your performance if it does.  I highly recommend you do your research, check out other cards and see how well they cool. How well a graphics card can be cooled is a pretty important metric.",Negative
AMD,"They're not, that's just some self serving propoganda.  They skimp where the average person wouldn't think it's ASUS' fault but in reality the problems are low build qualities in places people wouldn't think.  EMI? Random crashes?  Low quality traces, cheap ass electronic components, coil whine, bad temps, so on.    On HEDTs they're known to be terrible and even some of their mbs for enthusiast stuff I see TONS of WHEA errors.  I see LOTS of asus GPUs on /r/nvidia that are literally ""coil whine, high temps"" and about 50% of them are asus.    You also don't see them issuing revisions to their GPUs whereas other AIBs actually do, because ASUS knows they can just say ""working as intended"" and never bring attention to something and avoid negative rep.  Everyone shits on Ventus despite the fact they got fixed and revised from MSI, Gigabyte and asrock have revision mobos labeled, but ASUS?  You don't see ANY of that shit despite **consistent** issues.",Negative

AMD,"I have an Asus TUF 5070 TI OC Edition. It's an amazing GPU. I can't even hear the fans and it's really nice and cool, many times better than my old EVGA 3070 Ti. The build quality is really quite great. I'm so happy to have upgraded. I have nothing to complain about. It's not propaganda. I just am having a great experience and had a great experience with Asus in the past, Some others may have bad experiences. It's not unique to any one brand. All brands make good and bad products.  Brand loyalty or brand hatred when it comes to these cards gets you nowhere if you want to know how things really are. Also recognize that those who have bad experiences are louder than the ones who have really good experiences. If people like something and have no issues, they are far less likely to comment on it. If people have a bad experience, they are much more likely to post online and complain.  The truth is you can have an absolute bad experience with any brand. As for customer service. I've had really good experiences with customer service with Asus... the brand well known for being the worst. I've had terrible customer service with really great brands.",Positive

Yeah man I used to think ASUS was good shit because my very first laptop from them in 2012 is still running better than any other hardware I got after that from them, but really, they are *the* worst.  I'm not saying you *can't* get a good product from ASUS but I have both had enough experience, observation, and critical thinking skill to definitively say to avoid any and all asus products.  I've run the gamut, so don't waste time with pointless whatevers.  I'm not your average user.  Neither am I a professional.  But I know for a fact that a great portion of their products are extremely low quality, particularly their gaming division where they're sold purely on name alone.  You can do better for other brands.  You think my shit is hate, but really, you just coped and ignored everything I said which is a lot more empirical.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah but you've gave me a lot of generalizations. I don't see anything research based at all like x % of people get this (that 50% isn't based on anything). There is nothing about what you said that appears research based. Rather just the worst things about everything. A majority of people won't get the issues you talk about because if they did, Asus would be out of business.  But come on man, I suggest you chill. I said what I said because you make it sound like if you go with Asus, you're doomed with issues. No you're not. You're full of hatred and it's very clear that you were never willing to listen in the first place.  By going with the insults right away and accusing me of spewing propaganda, you instantly lost credibility. No one wants to listen to a toxic individual like you. If you perhaps didn't go with the insults right away, you may have been seen as worthy of listening to.  I suggest if you want to have a real conversation, just calm down (cut it with the personal attacks). No one wants to listen to an angry, miserable person.",Negative
AMD,"Boy you took what I said *real* personally.  I suggest rereading my post and use your brain.  I just called you out on it, because it really just came up as cope of ""my N=1 sample was fine they can't be that bad man give em a break.""  I'm not going to repost everything I said, but I said what I said.  ASUS is trash, their quality is trash, and I have not just experience but observations to back it up.  If you think this is ""UR NOT CHILL"" that's 100% on you.",Negative
AMD,"Nah dude, you're the one who took it personally. You went straight for the insults long before I said anything against you.  A person with a brain and education knows that an argument or debate should not involve throwing insults as you're asking for it to go the wrong way when you do that.  Cope is a word I see people use all the time when they're pissed that someone is disagreeing with them. I made my point in disagreement and it clearly pissed you off.  Looking at the general consensus when it comes to Asus when you Google it online, majority of the people online say Asus has great build quality, just that the customer service sucks. Yet here you are claiming sort of the opposite of what I read beforehand and it still is true now.",Negative
AMD,"IIRC the 7 and 9000 series just go all out til they hit either the voltage or temp limit, and I believe 95 degrees is that temp limit. The better the cooler the higher the clock at that limit basically, from what I understand. I believe you don't have to worry unless you're seeing like 100 degrees, that would mean something is up.  Edit: Direct quote from AMD, [link to reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/jsy8bw/robert_hallocks_response_to_all_zen_3_thermal/)  >...The chip is engineered to live its life at this temperature with no detriment to longevity or reliability. In fact, this is the same design target we’ve had for a number of product generations, but it has not been until the Ryzen 7000 series that the platform has had access to a level of socket power that makes 95 C the temperature that delivers the most performance during multithreaded workloads…  That quote is about ryzen 3 and 4, but also applies to 5, AKA 9000",Neutral
AMD,Did you use enough thermal paste? Did you take out the sticker at the bottom of the cooler? Did you secure it well? Both fans connected to the cpu_fan header?,Neutral
AMD,"Its how it is, it'll boost until it'll reach the max clockspeed or thermal limit (95), i'm in the same boat.  Ofcourse you could replace it and hope for a lucky replacement or do what I did and just undervolt it and stability test overnight.",Neutral
AMD,"You really need to have the cpu cooler turned the other way around. The fans need pulling air in and out to the back of the rear  case fan. Also, check and make sure you have applied, but not too much thermal paste to cover only the cpu. Also, did you take off the plastic from the bottom of the cpu air cooler?",Neutral
AMD,Here's my fan setup:  [image](https://imgur.com/a/A57aEXk),Neutral
AMD,"Your cooler is upside down.   Make the labels go towards the bottom, and fans on the other side.",Neutral
AMD,"Is PBO on? If so, what settings? 95 degrees is within the spec so I wouldn't be too worried but it may indicate poor thermal contact or something if PBO isn't on",Neutral
AMD,"These chips are supposed to boost to their thermal limits. This is not concerning.  Your cooler is installed sub optimally.  If you're that bothered about the temperature you can set a lower power limit, but it will come at the cost of performance",Neutral
AMD,I thought there was something about that cooler not making contact with the hot spot of the cpu.,Neutral
AMD,"Like others said, rotate your cooler 180 degrees (you should be able to read the brand's name). That way, the heatsink will also be a bit more to the left, leaving more room for ram. And move the fans as well to the front of the case (cold air is coming from the right/ front of the case unless you have a really unusual case. So after rotating it 180 degrees, it should be (going from the front of the case/ right side) ram sticks -> fan -> heatsink -> fan -> heatsink.",Neutral
AMD,Flip the cooler  Also deactivate the integrated gpu in bios makes it run cooler,Neutral
AMD,You definitely have something wrong. These are unrealistic temperatures. Check the radiator mount/thermal paste etc.,Negative
AMD,And just like last time the answer is that this is what these CPUs do and it's part of the design.,Neutral
AMD,"Meant to boost until its thermal limit , on other chips this is 95c is there thermal throttle ,on this chip it will not go over 95c it’s designed to stay at that even if you had 2 360mm coolers with custom tubing it will still try and get to its limit",Neutral
AMD,See how it says be quiet? That should be read correctly when the hsf is installed correctly. Also the fans should exhaust out the back of the case,Neutral
AMD,"Do a cinebench r23 benchmark. If you score between 22000 and 23000, then you are getting near maximum performance and are fine to leave it as is.",Neutral
AMD,Get a better cooler. 240/360 AIO.,Neutral
AMD,Fudge brownies. That’s not fun. Good luck,Negative
AMD,Undervolt urgently,Neutral
AMD,People are talking nonsense in this thread. No the 9800x3d isn't meant to boost till it can't anymore and it can absolutely run demanding games while staying under 70°C. Unfortunately you kinda have to invest into a good 360 aio if you want the best perf out of this cpu.,Negative
AMD,Chatgpt for optimal fan configuration.  I have a 9900x3d and rtx 5090 and fan type / positioning guidance really helped get the temps down.,Positive
AMD,"Nonetheless these aren't normal temps, I had a 9800X3D that would idle at 80° - 90° and it was due to improper mounting of the heatsink, after fixing it it would sit idle around 50° and peak at around 70° or so",Negative
AMD,Yikes,Neutral
AMD,7800x3d here. My proc peaks at 91.5C after 20 mins of intense load. After a while it drops to 89.,Neutral
AMD,Since it's flipped could account for poor contact on where the actual cores are under the IHS. They should do a full remount and cleaning.,Neutral
AMD,"It looks like your cooler is on backwards.  Fans should be pulling air from the front, not the back.  I don’t think that fully explains the heat, though.",Negative
AMD,Dude your coolers fans are the wrong way.,Negative
AMD,Idk if you noticed but your cooler is a ʇǝᴉnb ǝq,Neutral
AMD,Bro 😭 how tf did u install the fans wrongly,Neutral
AMD,Upside down cooler. Fans should pull air from the front case fans and blow towards the rear I/O and exhaust and you should be able to read Be Quiet.   I’m actually curious how much of a different it makes.,Neutral
AMD,"I run 80C playing only battlefield. 3 things. 1. Move both fans over one slot. So it pulls in cool air. 2. Did you use the offset on the bracket for the cooler for am5? 3. Did you tighten hard enough on the two final screws?  I also have 2 more fans in the front of my case besides the cooler, but it works for me. I also used different thermal paste.",Neutral
AMD,If your intake fans are blowing towards the cooler... then you need to flip the fans on your CPU cooler - this is why your temps are high - because you're fighting against your own airflow and all thats happening is stagnating the air.,Negative
AMD,"Your cooler is definitely on backwards, you can tell by text and arrows",Neutral
AMD,Just curious but what mobo by the way?,Neutral
AMD,OP can we please get an update. You can't leave us hanging like this.,Negative
AMD,"Gaming yes 100% you are right but with work load you will see high 80s and scrape 90s just run cinebench r23 or wait for any games shaders it puts the cpu to the limit and the cpu does boost until its limit , either voltage or temp limit",Neutral
AMD,"They are normal for a multi core load, not idle. Their scenario was running multiple games at once.",Neutral
AMD,The 7800X3D thermal limit is 89,Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely, before doing any build, they should do some research. I'm pretty sure it comes with a manual. The OP  will have to redo the cpu fan process.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm not sure if I'm understanding the arrows correctly, but shouldn't they point in the direction the air will end up? Because in my in my mind the cool air should be coming from the left in the image (the front of the PC) and end up in the rear?",Neutral
AMD,"I gotcha my friend. Turn out, I'm fucking stupid and somehow for a couple of days I couldn't understand why people were saying it was the wrong way.. Then one night I had another look and holy shit, it was actually pulling from the rear not the front like everyone was saying. Anyways I re-applied the thermal paste and rotated the CPU cooler. Now I'm getting nowhere near the temps I did before. I'm happy.",Negative
AMD,"Oh yeah I didn't see he was playing both at once lol, probably normal then",Neutral
AMD,So hes thermal throttling?,Neutral
AMD,"Generally, the IO (on the left) is on the back of the PC where you exhaust the hot air.  The front of the PC should be on the right where you suck in the cool air.",Neutral
AMD,"Just to confirm, you are blowing air directly at the front of the case, which is also trying to blow cooler air at your air cooler. Air should flow through the case, from the front, past the air cooler, out the back/top. Flip it, and you should be doing a lot better.   Also confirm you removed the sticker from the cooler, and applied thermal paste properly when flipping it around.",Neutral
AMD,Happy it worked out. I wasn't sure if the conflicting fans would make that big of a difference but cool to know that it really did.  Happy gaming.,Positive
AMD,I don't get 60 frames on a rx 9070 xt haha,Neutral
AMD,I went from 3070 to 9070XT and it's been great. I wouldn't do it for BL4 though.,Positive
AMD,"Its is a substantial upgrade!  I would say go for it, if its cheaper by more $100 than 5070ti",Positive
AMD,"I have an rtx 3080, also runs like trash in this game, if you wanna save some money for now follow this video and enable framegen for your card. I did with mine and went from 30-60fps to 80-120 with low frametimes. Its like night and day.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?si=tVGAHCdb8hDEI8-J&v=Oa5V71yZWhE&feature=youtu.be",Negative
AMD,"[https://www.techspot.com/review/3033-borderlands-4-benchmark/](https://www.techspot.com/review/3033-borderlands-4-benchmark/)  Seems worth it to me. Make sure you use fsr4, pretty much a requirement with this game -\_-",Positive
AMD,"Send it, BL4 do like AMD cards more atm and if u are willing to play the settings game for like 20ish minutes then u can get pretty good performance without the game looking like a wet paining on a highway",Positive
AMD,It's the optimisation plus denuvo and UE5 that is the problem. Even higher end GPUs will have stutters.   Best way is to not support developers that launch now fix later. I will wait for it to be in bargain bin with all dlcs out and buy a finished product for way less money.,Negative
AMD,Bl4 is extremely demanding on cpu and gpu so imo you'd need both to be upgraded. And more likely the game will be updated to stop running worse than path traced games. Nothing will fix the stuttering besides the game itself being updated in the future,Negative
AMD,"I did this exact upgrade and it's been excellent, literally doubled my performance in some games. Don't play BL4 though. One thing I will note is that my 10600K is definitely holding it back sometimes, so you might want to look for a 5700x3D or 5800x3D to upgrade your CPU without having to buy a new motherboard and RAM.",Positive
AMD,I got a 9070xt  months ago Great card  bUT the caveats are:  No RTX HDR for older games. I got a HDR monitor 2 weeks ago and it looks amazing sadly AMD don't have an auto HDR foe older directx 10 9 games. Windows only supports dx12 I think with its auto hdr feature.  FSR 4 is good But many games older games still use crappy fsr 2 or 3 And the DLSS counterpart would have been better.  I'd day go for a nvidia 5070ti you get better HDR coverage and older dlss is better thanolder fsr.  Yes yes you can use injectors to force better fsr in older games etc etc but that's just a huge hassle....,Positive
AMD,"I just did the same, 3070 to 9070xt. The rest of my pc was 7years old so ended up pretty hard bottlenecked, even at 4k was bottlenecked, just finished swapping the rest out, ram, 9800x3d etc. made a big difference.   Frames for 4k in couple things   3070+8700k     9070xt+8700k   9070xt+9800x3d  Rust - 55.              80.                       120   BF1  - 90.                120.                      190-200  Overwatch - 100ish.    180.                 240capped",Neutral
AMD,You’d have a pretty solid performance upgrade but your cpu might bottleneck the GPU,Neutral
AMD,its cooked yea im aware haha,Neutral
AMD,What's your other pc specs? Ive for a 3070 and want to upgrade to a 9070xt or a 5070ti but im still on AM4. Can't really afford the whole set up upgrade atm.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea No valid  Bl4 was just the last trigger for the thought, the upgrade would be in general",Neutral
AMD,"Are they really that close in price (presumably in the US) there?  Here in Canada a 5070ti hovers between about $13-1400, and the 9070 xt is around $1000.",Neutral
AMD,I just compared Cheapest 9070xt in Germany starts at around 619 € where as the Nvidia starts at around 770€,Neutral
AMD,"Ah yes the modding way, I'm familiar. Ark ascended made me try out things..",Positive
AMD,"Yea definitely, ceo's words were something like ""use dlss"" and ""your hardware is just too bad"" too",Negative
AMD,Gearbox actually release spreadsheets with the best settings for different gpus recently But that sounds good thank you for the input!,Positive
AMD,I havent even touched my graphics settings and it runs great on my 5070ti,Positive
AMD,"Honestly yea that the best bet for this game  I bought it already but tbh not because I'm too much of a fan but more because my siblings bought it tho and having played bl2 to 3 with them, this just felt like tradition. It's just sad that they're disappointing like this",Positive
AMD,This is amazing info thank you!,Positive
AMD,I was afraid of that yea..,Neutral
AMD,I wouldn't upgrade just for bl4 but I'm very happy with my machine otherwise,Positive
AMD,Look at the hardware unboxed benchmark for this game. It’s hard to hit 60 fps on a 5090 even at native.  Dlss and fsr are necessary.,Negative
AMD,For 60fps in borderlands you need an RTX 5090 thats the cheapest option,Neutral
AMD,"oh, I went full upgrade of everything, from an 10700k to 9800x3d and such. Probably wasn't the best use of my money, but I let tariff fomo rule me.",Negative
AMD,"I bought a 5070ti in anticipation for Borderlands and the game runs great for me. I had a 3060ti before, so pretty close to your current card.    I was about to buy the 9070xt but suddenly all 50 series card came with a free copy of Borderlands lol",Positive
AMD,Damn that is a good amount more,Positive
AMD,I picked up a PNY 5080 for $1400 CAD pre-tax on Amazon. Now I see it's shot up to $2k because some third party seller thinks they can get more for it.  The Asus Prime 5080 went for $1400 too when it was on sale.,Neutral
AMD,"In Canada if you get it at MSRP + 12% tax it will come out to around 1220. I got ""lucky"" and got a 5080 for 1384 all in.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you guys have a Borderlands 4 bundle with 5070ti?  This can tip the scales if you were planning on getting the game.  Otherwise, its up to you. Either option is great",Positive
AMD,Yeah thank god for modders doing the developers job…,Positive
AMD,"I wouldn't use that sheet, like maybe as a place to start but definitely tweak them to what u like. I have a 4080S so we will have similar performance, and I definitely had to tweak my setting to get it to what I could stand.  But BL4 is seriously fun once u get the graphics figured out",Neutral
AMD,"Yea No it definitely wouldn't be just for borderlands, in general too",Neutral
AMD,I have a 4070 super getting 80fps…though I have a 1080p monitor which is probably helping a lot.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea OK valid and nice timing. Have the game already so it's just about the cards, and the amd one being cheaper makes it more interesting for me atm",Positive
AMD,"I got the same card when it was on sale for 1373.81.  It arrived with the box sticker messed up but the everything inside seemed untouched (the gpu was still sealed with the yellow sticker in the anti-static bag.  I did record myself opening the amazon package. When I complained to customer service saying that I might've received an open box sold as new, they gave me a 10% discount.",Neutral
AMD,1000x1.12 is only $1120?   Wow that's a steal.  Was...it a 'steal'?,Neutral
AMD,We do yes but I bought the game already and then noticed it's ass performance  But thank you!,Negative
AMD,Its just insane..,Neutral
AMD,"Damn ok I see, thank you mate",Positive
AMD,"Honestly my only recommendation is just don’t play borderlands. I’m sure there’s better shooter looter games out there, tho I upgraded from a 4060ti to a 9070xt to play monster hunter wilds at 1440p, pretty happy in all honesty. I’ve been playing with maxed graphics and fsr4  Not that I need fsr4 but it looks better than native",Positive
AMD,4070 super is a 1440p gpu. Thats why you are getting 80.,Negative
AMD,"I think you should just do it. There's a bunch of good games coming out these days, and it's a good upgrade from your current card.  You could also sell your old card to squeeze in the budget for a 5070ti. I sold my 3060ti for 200 bucks + I think 50 series card still come with a free Borderlands copy (check at the retailer), which you could sell as well.",Positive
AMD,Sorry yeah 750 USD would be around 1030 CAD.  Got the 5080 from Amazon but it arrived open boxed. The GPU was still sealed in the anti static bag with a sticker. Brought this up to Amazon customer service and they gave me a 10% discount which basically was a tax refund.,Neutral
AMD,My friend told me performance has improved after the patch. Idk by how much,Positive
AMD,Well it’s really helping me out. No downsides,Positive
AMD,5800x3d is hard to come by new now. Personally I would go AM5 due to availability and pricing.,Neutral
AMD,5800xt would be a reasonably large jump,Neutral
AMD,"Id move to ddr5 with any new update at this point, your video card and nvme drives can prolly make use of a better mobo.",Positive
AMD,I jumped to a 5900xt definitely worth it.,Positive
AMD,"I'm not sure but I believe your mobo is also pretty good right? you could just update that cpu and you'll be pretty set for a few more years without issues, or you could go Am5 and gain a little bit more speed if you can afford all the new parts and another good Cpu and be set for more years.  Personally I'd just update that cpu, but that's up to you and it also depends on what you do with your PC.",Positive
AMD,"If you can get one at a decent price sure, but it might be time.",Neutral
AMD,"AM5, DDR5 ram is your option here",Neutral
AMD,"Yes. A normal Zen 3 chip would be a decent boost in performance. That said, if you can snag up a 5800x3d/5700x3d, that would be your best bet of eliminating a CPU bottleneck, if not completely. Only issue is that those chips are pretty pricey these days. It might make some sense upgrading to a r7 7700 and have an option for a future Zen 6 upgrade, though in reality, that's a similar situation to buying Zen 2 to waiting for Zen 3 was. You still have to weigh the value of it when the time comes.      It might just make sense to upgrade to the highest option now (Zen5 X3d) and stick with it. This way, you can push the max performance out of your GPU now rather than later.",Positive
AMD,You could get a 5700x.  It is about $130 and would be a modest upgrade if you wanted to squeeze a little more life out of your old system and don't want to or can't pay for a new AM5 platform.,Neutral
AMD,5800 and 5900 are big upgrades. Id do that and wait a while before upgrading to a new build.,Neutral
AMD,"If you could find a decently priced 5700x3d or 5800x3d (where they dont cost as much as a new 7600X + AM5 motherboard + RAM) then sure, those 2 CPU's should hold up til AM6.",Neutral
AMD,"Having gone from a 3600X to a 5800X myself, I can say for sure that it's a huge, noticeable upgrade. The 5800X is still doing quite well for me today, but then again, I haven't bought any new games in a while.  If you can find a 5700X or higher for a decent price, go for it.",Positive
AMD,"Whatever is cheapest between the 5700x, 5800x, and 5800xt. All will be a nice uplift. You will need a new cooler as well.  No sense in going for an AM4 x3d chip when they’re so  expensive. Nor am5 when the 8 core 5000’s are still very solid CPU’s",Neutral
AMD,"5800X3D is out of production pretty much, and likely the 5700X3D. So stock is getting low and demand is still the same so in that sense, prices are gonna be high. Especially the 5700X3D - you used to be able to buy for a tad under $200 from AliExpress. These days its now approaching $300 just like the 5800X3D.   If you can get either one used, for $250 or less, then it might be worth it - but very unlikely to find one that low considering people already paying nearly $300 for used samples.   IMO new or used, makes it a bad value proposition.    This is roughly the bare-minimum you'd be paying for an AM5 upgrade (keeping all other hardware you currently have), and IMO the better route to go, where you'll have a future upgrade path on AM5 with at least 1 or 2 more CPU generations before AM6 comes out (and that wont happen for several more years). You can then sell your old AM4 platform to recoup some of the money spent. Like a 3600X, RAM and Mobo would easily sell for $120-150 - your theoretical total spend for an AM5 upgrade would be roughly $300-310, right at what a 5700/5800X3D CPU would have cost you  [PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bQGKh7)  Type|Item|Price :----|:----|:---- **CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 9600X 3.9 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4r4Zxr/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-39-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100001405wof) | $184.70 @ Amazon  **Motherboard** | [ASRock B850I Lightning WiFi Mini ITX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9hqNnQ/asrock-b850i-lightning-wifi-mini-itx-am5-motherboard-b850i-lightning-wifi) | $189.99 @ Newegg  **Memory** | [Patriot Viper Venom 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4cCCmG/patriot-viper-venom-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-pvv532g600c30k) | $85.99 @ Newegg   | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |  | **Total** | **$460.68**  | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2025-09-16 01:24 EDT-0400 |",Neutral
AMD,Literally same setup I had. Just upgraded to a 5700x3d. Having some minor issues but I think I need to update the bios I think my board predates the 3d chips.,Negative
AMD,5800x or XT would be a good enough jump if you wanna stay in AM4 for longer or if you believe you can wait till AM6 is ready. Just keep in mind the cooler as the 5800X and XT are some really warm mfs,Positive
AMD,depends on ur budget   5800x3D and 5700x3D aint worth it anymore since theyre out of production and cost too much.  a 5700x3D is like 200-250 and at that point just save up for AM5  what is worth is like a a 5800X u can get for 130ish and will give you a decent boost until u need to upgrade for a new  gpu,Negative
AMD,"I went from a 2600X to a 7600X and the performance jump was quite big, so going from a 3600X to something on AM5 like a 9600X would be a good upgrade path for you.",Positive
AMD,"After running into crazy bottlenecks and a lot of stuttering/hitching with these newer games coming, it became apparent my 2600 just couldn't keep up anymore (r5 2600, a320 board, 3060). I just bumped up to a 5600x and a way better cooler for just over 100 bucks with shipping last week. That little upgrade alone was enough for me to get back into the 120+ fps area with lows in 70s. For example, trying to play BF2042 the 2600 was barely breaking 30fps and was just a glitchy mess.",Negative
AMD,A 5600x or 5800 xt. A 5950x if you do a lot of multitasking and streaming.,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the responses everyone \^_\^ It sounds like a 5700xt or above would be a good upgrade, I'll see what microcenter has in stock next time I'm out shopping.",Positive
AMD,"yeah, I figure I'll get one of those eventually to replace my 3600. Assuming they don't stop making those too.",Neutral
AMD,"I run a 5800x3d with 9700 xt. From all I found find, I'm missing out on a frame or 2 compared to equivalent hardware on AM5.  The cost of new RAM, board and chip is a lot if it's not doing more.  The difficulty these days is no more AM4 x3d chips.",Negative
AMD,"I don’t think it will be long. DDR4 production is being wound down and AM4 is 9 years old now. Given the most popular CPUs are no longer produced it can’t be long now until they stop the rest. I’ve been on AM4 now for 6 years, it was a great platform but I think it’s had its time.",Negative

AMD,"Sure, nearly everything *somewhat* benefits from it. But the gist of it is that CS:GO was very cache-optimised and benefitted much more from high clock rates, which were fairly limited on X3D chips before Ryzen 9 due to the thermal limitations of the chip layout.  An i9-12900K for example had 30 MB combined L2/L3 cache. That's like 50x as much as the processors that could run the original CS at 100 FPS. 96MB cache on an X3D chip is obviously superior, but not necessarily a critical advantage for games that use cache efficiently.

And about the same percentage in reduction to the perceived size of the stroboscopic steps (the name of the gaps between each after image from the phantom array effect) perceived on motions relative to the eyes position.  >Because a 1000hz OLED or IPS won't look better in motion clarity than the current 600hz TNs with BFI.  Depends on your definition of motion clarity.       If you mean it as just the amount of image persistence based eye tracking motion blur. Then yes, you have a point as they already have 1ms persistence backlight strobbing LCDs. You can even go sub millisecond if you play around with the strobn duty cycle length, Which would already beat a 1000Hz sample and hold monitor in the race for the lowest image persistence)  If you mean motion clarity in a more encompassing way though. Then no. Because the 1000Hz monitor will have shorter stroboscopic steps on relative motions making the motion look more natural for any motion that happens relative to your eyes position.  The ideal ""retina"" refresh rate saturates each pixel described by the motion. Which for fast paced games would already easily justify 10KHz+. So we're still far away from the end goal of a refresh rate high enough for motion to look on a screen just like it does when we look at real physical objects moving.",Neutral

AMD,"""random tweet"" and it's the CS pro with the most technical knowledge, alright man. He also put a series of tweets talking about the performance of the game, if you find that irrelevant that's on you but his opinion is way more important than yours when you make up your claims from an imaginary world.

Why do so many streamers choose to have a dedicated 2nd PC then?  \>Oh, the old ''0.1%'' lows argument.  You act extremely arrogant for someone who was not able to put out any amount of evidence for his claims.

AMD,That performance delta on RDNA3 is **much** better than I was expecting for having dedicated hardware on RDNA4. Guessing the dedicated chips aren't doing as much as I thought.,Positive
AMD,"Wait, so does that mean 7800XT, 7900 XTX, and 7900 XT will see a boost in performance after patch?",Neutral
AMD,Good. 7000 users got screwed. Every AAA game needs upscaling these days and FSR3 looks like unusable dog shit in motion. Would definitely be worth a 7% performance hit.,Negative
AMD,It is looking more promising seeing the data and how RDNA3 is handling FSR4.,Positive
AMD,"""Works on RDNA 2 and RTX 30"", is certainly a statement. It works, but it either has horrible ghosting or horrible performance.  RDNA 3 works well enough, to the point where it can easily replace XeSS and FSR 3 for me. WMMA could help a bit, but this leaked Int8 model is mostly proof of concept anyway.     An official release would perform and look much better, and we now have undeniable proof that FSR 4 is not at all too heavy to run on RDNA 3, or RDNA 2 technically, the only issue there is visuals, not performance.     AMD has no excuse anymore, if they don't bring it to at least RDNA 3, they are artificially limiting it.",Negative
AMD,Does anyone have a step by step guide to get this working on an RX 6800?,Neutral
AMD,"I want to be able to turn on dlss and fsr scaling at the same time. Plus, both frame gens and lossless scaling. Let's see what kind of mess we can make.",Neutral
AMD,This is interesting but it's the same performance as FSR 4 on Linux with the FP8 model (using FP8 -> FP16 hacks). Makes sense that AMD didn't release this as it probably hasn't been optimized and is likely only a PoC.,Neutral
AMD,The amount of dog piling  and excuses I was getting for saying this should have happened long ago...,Negative
AMD,"oh I hope we poor RDNA2 users gets it too, can’t stand FSR 3.1 ghosting no more",Negative

AMD,So they artificially limit FSR 4 to RX 90 series? Fk corporate lmao. Even greedier than Nvidia.,Negative
AMD,"Yes. They used fp8 on normal shaders, which is faster than int8",Positive
AMD,who tell u? RDNA 3 had inferior image compared to RDNA 4 on FSR 4,Neutral
AMD,"Drop in performance, but much higher FSR image quality.",Neutral
AMD,There is no hit per se. Comparing with fsr3 is useless. Comparing with Native or XESS is the way to go.,Negative
AMD,"Hell yeah, I use my 7900XT for upscaled 4k 60hz,so at quality upscaling I'm still leaving performance on the table and I'd still be at the 60 fps limit anyways.",Negative
AMD,They screwed themselves by vastly overrating vram and raster performance relative to RT performance and upscaling.    My goddamn 2060 32 bit card has access to dlss4. AMD can't even do that with their previous flagships,Negative
AMD,"Curious about what's the difference in training & ultimate final image quality.   Tangentially, on LLMs, 8-bit quantization (Q8/INT8) is seen to have a lower quality output compare to FP8 while taking up the same amount of VRAM.",Neutral
AMD,"Agreed. I bought a 7900XTX and 4090FE for 2 different systems, but I feel like I wasted money with the 7900XTX when a 4080 Super would have been better value",Negative
AMD,I want to know too (6900xt) but I'm assuming performance will be dogshit.,Neutral
AMD,I turned on Nvidia Multi-Frame Gen + Lossless Scaling Frame Gen at the same time before. It was a hilariously bad experience. Moving the mouse had like a 0.5s-1s delay,Negative
AMD,"In theory:  Dlss ultra performance: 3x scaling  FSR4 ultra performance: 3x scaling  These multiply, so 9x total scaling.  Dlss provides up to 4x frame generation, meaning 3 generated frames per rendered frame. Fsr FG only does 1:1. In theory, these could also multiply to 8x, minus any overhead.  So, taking a 4k screen and cutting it down, we get an internal resolution of 427x240p. With an 8x frame multiplier, this only needs to run at 30 input fps to max out a 240hz monitor. Only 1 in every 648 pixels is rendered by the game.",Neutral
AMD,"FP8 model is seemingly slower in my tests   2.1ms int8, 2.8ms fp8",Negative
AMD,Could you explain it a bit more detailed for me? FSR 4 will perform the same as FSR 3 but have better image quality on Linux if I understand you correctly? I also have a 7900XT,Neutral
AMD,"This method works for RDNA 2, but since RDNA 2 doesn't have WMMA matrix multiplication, it doesn't look very good.  The Linux Mesa driver has a different workaround using emulation, which looks much better, but performance is worse.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, no",Neutral
AMD,"Eh, more like the RDNA 3/3.5 version wasn’t ready yet. It seems like they will be officially porting it next year with the launch of FSR 4 on PS5 Pro which is already planned. The real question is about the AMD APUs which are also rumoured to get this FSR 4 version.",Neutral
AMD,???  Did you even read the article?,Neutral
AMD,Or a gain in performance as more aggressive upscaling now leads to the same or better visuals.,Neutral

AMD,"The performance is good, but since RDNA 2 doesn't have WMMA matrix multiplication, it looks pretty bad.  On my 6950XT, FSR 4 quality on Cyberpunk performed about the same as XESS 2.0 quality.  I followed this video:  https://youtu.be/iOndUPO9_NE?si=6MLSa7If4SKyriB-",Negative
AMD,This is what I'm talking about. Just want to see what kind of terrible it could be haha,Negative
AMD,You forgot the input lag that makes game streaming look like the better viable option,Negative
AMD,Oh what a beautiful mess this would be,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I did some testing and it seems to depend on the game. Occasionally I was able to get better results out of the FP8 model but the INT8 model runs much more consistently.,Neutral
AMD,You know he didn't,Neutral
AMD,Yes that's true. FSR4 Performance mode *does* look better than FSR3 Quality mode.,Positive
AMD,"Why does no one actually read the article and just spout drivel?  > I got it working, 7% performance delta in CP77 at 1440P with FSR in quality. FSR cost went from 0.4ms to 1.2ms - ish  An *increase* in FSR cost by 2-3x results in a *decrease* in performance.  > The FSR 4 DLL is apparently working on both RDNA 3 and RDNA 2 GPUs, which is interesting, and this is reportedly bringing some big upgrades in the visuals. However, the performance impact can be noticeable since the time for frame processing can be three times higher. Nonetheless, most users are seeing 6-7 FPS lower, but significantly better visual quality.",Neutral
AMD,FSR3 blows ass. FSR4 and DLSS is in a whole different league,Neutral
AMD,"Just saying FSR2/3 ""isn't as good as DLSS"" is a major understatement. I've used DLSS on 20, 30, and 40 series cards, and FSR on 6000, 7000, and 90 series cards (FSR4 on 90 series). The difference in quality between FSR2/3 vs FSR4 and DLSS is pretty drastic. This might not be as apparent if you're using Quality upscaling at 4K, but overall DLSS/FSR4 Performance looks better than FSR2/3 Quality. Artifacting, shimmering, and overall temporal stability can be downright atrocious on FSR2/3. You don't have to be a ""pixel peeper"" to see entire fields of foliage fizzling in the background.",Neutral
AMD,I don't think you have an nvidia gpu. There is a large noticeable difference between the 2. DLSS 4 is just fullstop better.,Neutral
AMD,I just sold my 7900xtx and bought a 5080 and dlss is superior fullstop. At the same price you cant really argue. I dont know if Id pay a premium for it but in 2025 a 7900xtx is still almost at much as a 5080. Makes no sense.,Negative
AMD,"I disagree, I think it's unusable even in Quality mode, while with DLSS 4 I think even Performance mode looks fine in most games at 4K. That's a massive performance increase.  Go watch some DLSS 4 vs FSR3 video comparisons. FSR is constantly all blurry and ghosty in motion.",Negative
AMD,"Brother, FSR3 gets cucked by the inferior version of XeSS that runs on AMD cards, it's that fucking bad.   https://preview.redd.it/ehu165d0zkpf1.png?width=1109&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c4e0f1372be86406c89a6ceb0ea115abbac1ccd  XeSS Quality (1.7x scaling) on left, FSR3 Quality (1.5x scaling) on right.

AMD,"you can go back in my post history and see that i have one post about nvidia drivers and another in a TW game where i list my specs, both listing the 4080 super.   if you dont have arguments, simply call the other person a lair lol",Neutral
AMD,"again, never said it isnt superior (this is getting boring lol), just that the difference isnt as big as some of you purist make it out to be  you can easily go back in my comment history and see that i recommend getting a nvidia GPU when prices are the same for higher models",Neutral
AMD,"No, he's literally comparing FSR3 Quality (84FPS) to FSR4 Quality (77FPS). Much better image quality, with drop in performance.  Again, this is all in the article.",Neutral
AMD,"I was. He’s an indignant douchebag, though.",Neutral
AMD,Im saying that at the same price the 7900xtx IS a waste of money.,Neutral
AMD,"I think he was comparing FSR3 Quality to FSR4 Balanced, which is reasonably the change a lot of people are going to make, seeing as it's both a performance, AND a visual gain",Neutral
AMD,"I was comparing to native, not FSR3.",Neutral
AMD,"Fsr3 had no ML overhead and was always high on performance, low on quality.   Better to compare XESS dp4a vs fsr4",Neutral
AMD,How is that even remotely relevant? Of course FSR is going to be a performance improvement over native. It's the entire point of upscalers. And the article itself is comparing FSR3 to FSR4 - so you're even further off base to try and compare native to FSR4.,Neutral
AMD,True - but most people coming to this news would be more interested in how it compares to what they're already running - which is the crappy image quality of FSR3.,Negative
AMD,But people also have been using XESS. Only comparing it to FSR3 is a biased way to downplay fsr4 on rdna3  Jsut put the xess numbers too and I am happy,Neutral
AMD,"Thing is that the comparison is more nuanced than that. FSR4 performance looks better than FSR3/XeSS quality, so unless you were using already performance mode, you will probably still get same or better fps, with a noticeable increase in image quality.  And we're still talking of non-supported FSR4 implementation on RDNA3, if AMD ever spends time working on a variant for RDNA3 themselves, we could get better performance, time will tell.",Neutral

AMD,Better cable management then the mess I hid behind my psu shroud lol,Neutral
AMD,"First time I've seen someone building with that XFX card design in black, seen the white one a couple times. Looks like a nice build.   I'm also a fan of Fractal's Pop cases, I've got a pink one myself (the medium size)",Positive
AMD,"I see a Fractal POP , I upvote! My favorite case.",Neutral
AMD,Very martixy!,Neutral
AMD,"Awesome case, I should have gotten the 16gb card tbh but its running great so far.",Positive
AMD,"Love this case, so easy to build in!",Positive
AMD,$600,Neutral
AMD,Thats around what I was thinking thanks for the input,Positive
AMD,"Put the build in PCPartPicker, it'll tell you.  Anyway, with a build like this, why skimp? Consult the [tier list](https://cultists.network/140/psu-tier-list/), and buy a B tier or above (this one is C tier) 850w instead. If anything, cut down the 9800X3D to a 7800X3D that'll serve you nearly as well, and pick up a better PSU.",Neutral
AMD,"the picture is from an brazillian , and as far I can tell, is already brutally expensive (8.000BRL is around 1.480USD, but our minimum monthly wage is like 250USD) , not counting the fact that the gpu is not even present in the price (last check I did it was like 11.000BRL alone (around 2.000USD)  OP, se poder esticar um pouco o orçamento ou esperar um pouco mais, eu recomendaria o msi A850GL, sobre 750w ser suficiente, na teoria sim, o 9800x3D em si puxa bem pouco assim como todo o resto do seu setup, mas essa fonte em si é BEM basica , tipo bem basica mesmo, minimo do minimo, ela não custa isso por generosidade da XPG, se vai dropar uma grana pesada nessa num setup top que nem esse, melhor pelo menos deixar uma fonte descente pra ficar tranquilo.",Neutral
AMD,![gif](giphy|l2Sq5Ij6m33GyZEha),Neutral
AMD,I don’t think resetting your bios to default caused this.  Normally resetting your bios to default settings will get you running again if for example you set a bad overclock. My guess is you hosed your system with whatever fix you were trying to make.  Probably going to have to reinstall windows.,Negative
AMD,Shut down the PC.  Turn off the PSU.  Hold power button down for 5 seconds to discharge PC.  Remove 2 sticks of ram.  Plug everything back in and boot up.,Neutral
AMD,if you boot from another live usb does it do this?,Neutral
AMD,"You dont do anything you except change basic few settings if you know how, or flash Bios, for all the rest you ask pros...",Negative

AMD,- A product by AMD - A consistent naming scheme easy to understand  Choose one.,Neutral
AMD,All wild rumours.,Neutral
AMD,"Being confident in your own products and not using a naming system near identical to the one used by your competitors would be a good start, but that's wishful thinking.",Neutral
AMD,They make the name confusing on purpose obviously,Neutral
AMD,I mean we already know they can't do that because when they don't everyone just assumes AMD is the cheapo option even if its the fastest CPU you can buy.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, one lf the reasons is that it's easier to sell old products as brand new or make inferior products look not so bad.",Neutral
AMD,"Sad. It's likely the same dumb consumers who believe the ""bigger number = better"" marketing BS.",Negative
AMD,"I mean the Ryzen 3 7 9... solved that problem people understand that because Intel has hammered it into their brains. It's just the extra names that are crazy, useless and confusing.  Literally better if they had renamed ti Aizen (oh wait thats a bad guy)",Negative
AMD,"I admit the Ryzen 3/5/7/9 branding is a good exception and just works. But I also dislike the ""Ryzen AI"" word salad and now Radeon RX x0y0 (XT) instead of RX xy00 (XT) system of previous generations that worked just fine.",Negative
AMD,"OK, so here I go, Ryzen 9825 next year we get Ryzen 9826 ..... whoooooooo amazing.  3 7 9 can be number of cores  1-9 can be perf range segment, eg a 16 core ultra low power is an 91 a 2 core ultra low power is a 31  Netbook has a 3125  Gaming desktop has 9925  Simplified but still clear naming is GOOD for marketing. It helps people buy the right thing and be happy with what they got...  applies for GPUs too, AMD's GPU stack is not more than 10 thick and for some they can ignore the naming eg OEM / Embedded can get a different name if it needs to get out of the consumer marketing stack.  I think Prizm would be a good brand name to reduce Radeon Pro \[AI\] R\[W\]\[WX\]xxxx naming down to something sane. under then same nomenclature. So AMD Prizm 9926 would be the top workstation GPU next year.  I think the market control groups are partly to blame for this whole issue... because a name is NOT supposed to really convey all the information, its only supposed to clearly identify a card. But they are probably asking people questions like ""how does this GPU make you feel"" or ""do you think this \[insert long forgettable GPU name\] is fast at AI"" type questions ....",Positive
AMD,They just keep finding silicon down the back of the couch,Neutral
AMD,Lisa Su became CEO of AMD in 2014. Coincidence?,Neutral
AMD,"Re-releasing old CPUs with slightly different clocks is not extending the AM4 platform  The last actually new CPU on AM4 was the 5800X3D in early 2022 (or the 5600X3D in 2023, though that one's not retail).   Everything after that was just a re-release with slightly different clock speeds and prices.",Neutral
AMD,how about you make some more 5800xds,Neutral
AMD,AM4: Never gonna die!,Positive
AMD,keep AM4 alive,Neutral
AMD,"So now AMDs F designation doesn't mean non working APU...? (Well kind of, but the original also didn't have working APU) Great naming convention going on.",Positive

AMD,AM4 : I haven't heard the belt yet.,Neutral
AMD,Goated platform.,Neutral
AMD,AM4 refuses to die.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t care about the CPUs, it’s kinda annoying that they keep changing details in the name which can make huge differences for potential buyers.  But claiming 9 years of platform support for AM4 is just ridiculous. There hasn’t been a new architecture since 2020 on AM4.",Negative
AMD,May as well make a 5300 and 5400. Bring back Ryzen 3 lmao,Neutral
AMD,Absolutely not she’s the best thing that could’ve happened. I know am5 isn’t going to have this level of support but god damn is it a good run. Am6 Might have more longevity than am5 due to more pin outs allowing for a higher data transfer rate.,Positive
AMD,Ryzen 5000 series launched more or less at the same time as Apple's first M chip. Coincidence?,Neutral
AMD,Wouldn't the last am4 one technically be the 5700x3d? In 2024.,Neutral
AMD,"Extending a platform ≠ new CPU.  And 5600X3D was also not a new CPU, it's the same die as 5800X3D that doesn't meet all the requirements to be a 5800X3D, just like how this one is using the same 8-core die as 5700X.",Neutral
AMD,"While that's true, there still is a huge amount of overhead for adding a new sku, whether it is new silicon or not. You need a new agesa and you have to get all your board partners to update decade-old products as well, which also helps encourage security updates for boards that might have otherwise aged out of support.   AMD absolutely deserves the applause they're getting for this.",Neutral
AMD,"Its an extension of the socket as its adding more silicon for the socket to the market, 5600f exist because its a 5600 that cant meet the clock speeds reliably so making a new sku at a cheaper price is the obvious choice. Just like how the 5600X is a higher binned 5600 while the entire ryzen 5 line is actually a lower binned ryzen 7 where 2 cores on the CCD are not reliable in some way.",Neutral
AMD,I'm assuming they're aligning the naming of everything up.,Neutral
AMD,2022,Neutral
AMD,5100x3d is exactly what the world needs right now,Neutral
AMD,Any X3D AM4 CPU after the 5800X3D would be considered a lowered binning of that CPU. The 5700X3D just can't clock as high as the 5800X3D but the performance difference is negligible.,Neutral
AMD,"> you have to get all your board partners to update decade-old products as well, which also helps encourage security updates for boards that might have otherwise aged out of support.  that reminds me, I need to check for MB bios updates",Neutral
AMD,>AMD absolutely deserves the applause they're getting for this  For what? The consumer does not benefit from this in any way.  Yeah it's more effort for them than just lowering the price of existing SKUs. But that doesn't make it any better. We should be wondering why AMD is doing this.,Negative
AMD,"Still zen 3 and in my own experience, 5800x3d is not much of an upgrade from 5800x unless all you do is play cs2 at 720p low",Neutral
AMD,That would be an APU.,Neutral
AMD,I'd still say it was an extension of am4 due to the value it provided over the 5800x3d though. It allowed many am4 gamers on 3000 series to upgrade without breaking the bank.,Positive
AMD,"if it ain't broken, don't fix it.",Negative
AMD,">  5800x3d is not much of an upgrade from 5800x unless all you do is play cs2 at 720p low  Even at 1440p there is a *massive* difference in 1% lows and frame-time smoothness going from a 5700x to a 5700x3d, in a wide multitude of games.",Neutral
AMD,"By that logic a 7700X is also no better than a 5800X for a gaming PC.  The 5800X3D is \~30% faster than the 5800X/5950X in gaming.  If you play PubG, Tarkov, Warhammer Space Marine 2, racing games and sims, flight sim, in these games it can and does make a significant difference if you have a good GPU.   If you're GPU limited, like in most AAA games, then yeah it wouldn't make a difference, but neither would a 9800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"APU with 3D V-Cache would be fire tho Also weren’t 200 and 400 the APUs, at least during the last 2000 and 3000 Zen and Zen+ lineups?",Neutral
AMD,"Same CPU. It offers the same thing and is not an extension to the platform.  Whether they just lower the price of the 5800X3D or they re-release it as a 5700X3D to quietly lower the price, does not really matter in the end.  Especially AMD is known for lowering the prices. The 2700X launched at 330 and 2 years later it was 130 on sale on prime day. But that didn't make it a new CPU or an extension to the platform.  I would consider the 5600X3D an extension though, as it offered something that was not offered before (even though it is a cut down 5800X3D). But it was not retail (with a few small exceptions), so it arguably doesn't count.",Neutral
AMD,unless a newer bios has security patches,Neutral
AMD,Budget Ryzen3 when?,Neutral
AMD,"This post has been flaired as a rumor.   Rumors may end up being true, completely false or somewhere in the middle.  Please take all rumors and any information not from AMD or their partners with a grain of salt and degree of skepticism.",Negative
AMD,If it's INT8 it should work on RDNA2 onwards,Neutral
AMD,Hopefully AMD will release this officially for the 7000 cards soon.,Positive
AMD,Fsr4 at similar fps to fsr3 quality or native without the shimmering / aliasing... Sign me up,Positive
AMD,Ancient Gameplays got it working    https://youtube.com/watch?v=iOndUPO9_NE,Neutral
AMD,What's the point of FSR 4 on rtx 3000?,Neutral
AMD,"I checked it out in FFVII Rebirth.  It's worse quality than XESS Currently: Static-y, shimmering, unstable.  BUT  Much more fine detail is preserved (Both 100% and 66% scale)  at the SAME PERFORMANCE as XESS.  FSR3 in FFVII Rebirth sucks. Tons of ghosting, I straight up refuse to use it, so with some tweaking it might actually be usable, and definitely will be better than XESS with a little work.  All on a 6900 XT.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah and now we also likely know why AMD wasn't going forward with this on RDNA3. While the quality is good, the performance impact is significant. It's hardly any faster than native full-res rendering.  What would actually be needed for older GPUs is an even simpler ML model. That would probably result in a quality somewhere between FSR 3.1 and FSR 4.0, but with less computational cost.",Negative
AMD,"Yep, I got it implemented in decky framegen via optiscaler, no weird proton version or fp8 hack needed. You can even use on steam deck, though it’s still somewhat heavy:  https://github.com/xXJSONDeruloXx/Decky-Framegen/releases",Positive
AMD,[Results on a RX6800 (FPS included)](https://imgur.com/a/41t9yAD),Neutral
AMD,"I tested it on a RX6800. shadows were noisy, FPS went from 100 to 80 (FSR3 vs FSR4) in Cyberpunk 2077 @ quality settings and 3440x1440. I will stick to using XeSS in Cyberpunk. use DLSS swapper to keep whatever you use up to date.  [Here's the results ](https://imgur.com/a/41t9yAD)",Neutral
AMD,Can we have this for RX 6000 series?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought using FSR4 on 7000 series and lower cards didnt get better performance, if anything games ran worse?",Negative
AMD,Can anyone compare this with dlss 4 in darktide?,Neutral
AMD,It's not good on RDNA 3—only a 2-3% performance increase in balanced mode. It should actually decrease performance when used as a filter at native resolution. You need to run in performance mode to see any performance increase.,Negative
AMD,I got me a 3080 12gb. Be sweet if it worked on mine lmfao,Positive
AMD,"Took only one month for a random user to make it work, AMD is a joke.",Negative
AMD,Do you mean vk khr shader float16 int8 extension?,Neutral
AMD,"it does work on RDNA2, check r/radeon lots of people are already using it on windows",Positive
AMD,Technically 7nm Vega products (Renoir/Cezanne/Radeon VII) should also be capable. They also have dp4a support.,Neutral
AMD,It does! I tried it and only got -10% performance penalty when switching from 3.1.5 to 4.0.2  Only downside afaik is it only works properly on linux atm  Edit: forgot to mention I'm using an rx6700 xt with optiscaler,Neutral
AMD,Probably when the Redstone thing comes out they’ll release it for 7000.,Neutral
AMD,"Been using OptiScaler to emulate FSR 4.0 and spoof DLSS on an Asrock 7900 XTX Creator. Can still be hit or miss, but my experience has been fairly stable.",Neutral
AMD,Right now it’s significantly slower. What I saw was a 10 to 15 percent boost over native  on 7000 series for balanced.,Neutral
AMD,Proof of Concept kind of thing. It's like what if you run DLSS 4 on RDNA4,Neutral
AMD,"FSR 4 AA looks significantly better than DLSS 4 AA in many games, especially those that use a lot of dithering (i.e. almost every UE game).",Positive
AMD,if you want to use framegen on an rtx 3000 fsr is your only option. At least with fsr4 it'll look better than with fsr3,Positive
AMD,"At the end of the day, FSR and DLSS are upscalers using machine learning/AI models so it's not a wild concept the technologies can be interchangeable.",Neutral
AMD,"None, it will be slow. Maybe just show that it's possible.",Neutral
AMD,there's always far cry 6 only supporting fsr,Neutral
AMD,"For me, I could use it to get a little boost in FPS while at the same time possibly fixing some shimmering issues I get in some games even with Native. In an Ancient Gameplays video he showed some image quality benefits in Cyberpunk using FSR4 on RDNA3 over Native.",Positive
AMD,On RDNA 3 cards at 4K quality the difference between FSR 3 and FSR 4 is very small. 5% difference in performance. Only when doing 1080P Performance mode is it not as good. But seriously next to nobody is running 540P res upscaling anyways but its still better than native even at that low of a res.  Most people upscale at 4K and 1440P which FSR 4 has very little performance impact. So this benefit of running FSR 4 on RDNA 3 is incredible and the performance is still great. For instance I get 190 FPS running FSR 3 at Cyberpunk 1440P and with FSR 4 now im getting 180 FPS. Not that big of a difference with a massive boost in image quality.,Neutral
AMD,"As an RX 7900 XTX user, I am not concerned about the performance penalty when using FSR4. I'd only want FSR 4 for image quality purposes. ""...Hardly any faster than native full-res rendering"" is perfect if an RDNA3 user aims for better image quality compared to FSR 3.1.",Neutral
AMD,"Idk the performance uplift for me at 4k was significant, cyberpunk maxed out no rt I get about 40fps on my 6800 XT, with FSR4 I was capping at 60fps with vsync, more than acceptable. This was under windows 10.",Neutral
AMD,Just use DLSS? If you're talking about FSR frame gen you can already use it on 3000 series if the game has it,Neutral
AMD,"Lol he just compiled AMD code. If they wanted it out for 6000/7000 series cards, it would be.",Neutral
AMD,Why pay people to do something the community will do for you and then you can learn from and do and get credit for while paying less people?   Lisa's a genius at not paying people.,Negative
AMD,"I got it working on my AM4 rig on Linux. For some reason this sub keeps deleting any picture I post though (and why does the format have to be .gif?). Anyway latency cost on my 6950XT sits at around 2.6ms in Oblivion Remastered. It looks better compared to XESS in the distance, much less shimmering. At least at the balanced preset, quality preset gives me crazy shimmering near the edges of my screen for some reason.  EDIT : works perfectly in Cyberpunk2077.. I feel like quality and performance are good enough that AMD could do an official release, if they just mention performance might be less compared to FSR3.x I really see no issue. Anyway, genie's out of the bottle now, your move AMD ;).",Neutral
AMD,"It will be a good upgrade for steamdeck and other handhelds.    I think AMD may be planning to launch this soon, perhaps when redstone comes out.",Positive
AMD,"From what I gathered on Windows it has a lot of ghosting, but not on Linux (maybe to do with the drivers?).",Neutral
AMD,"I'm using it in Cronos the New Dawn right now. Same performance as XeSS (which makes me wonder why they didn't release it for RDNA 2/3) but it's shimmering and ghosting incessantly even when standing still. If you have an RDNA 2 GPU, don't bother testing it on Windows. I expected to see a cleaner image at least when standing still, but it's even worse than the worst FSR implementations",Negative
AMD,Only Vega20(Radeon VII) supports INT8 - DP4a.,Neutral
AMD,"Technically they can, practically - 85ms on Linux (5600G).",Neutral
AMD,It works on windows too,Positive
AMD,How does the image quality compare to native in that scenario?,Neutral
AMD,FSR FG doesn't need FSR  They are independent,Neutral
AMD,"Some games unlink the upscaling and frame-gen, allowing you to use DLSS upscaling with FSR frame-gen. For other games you can use the dlssg-to-fsr3 mod.",Neutral
AMD,XeSS 2.1 fg works on most cards. It was pretty good on my 2080ti. But FSR is in more games than XeSS,Positive
AMD,Do rtx 3000 users not have dlss framegen?,Neutral
AMD,Unless they can use tensor cores for int 8 acceleration.,Neutral
AMD,"Interesting, A question   So this only affects Upscaling?  So if I have a 165hz/ 1440p Monitor  To see any benefit from this i would have to set my screen res as 1080 for it to ""Upscale"" to 1440 right?  This comes to my question, On my 7800XT with optimised settings, I can run most games at high quality at 1440p and still get around 100FPS in quite a wide variety of games, I was never a fan of FSR3 because it looked kinda wacky and i never seemed to notice the performance increase   So by doing this method of FSR4 am I going to see way better performance AND the benefits of 1440p? Or is it better to just stick with native? Im so confused",Neutral
AMD,woah its working on the 6000 series too?,Neutral
AMD,"Not in thw state it is rn, almost 0 perfomance gains from native resolution, it makes no sense",Negative
AMD,"I can't confirm if what your saying is true but it could be because FSR4 on linux is the FP8 model (running with FP8 emulation).  Afaik FP8 is the ""final"" model. Int8 was developed first and then AMD developed the FP8, probably because of image quality and/or performance.",Neutral
AMD,I heard ppl say because of some kind of emulation windows can't do but Linux does,Neutral
AMD,"MPO issue probably has to do with how MPO functions, and perhaps MPO is not enabled yet on linux or maybe it is and its simply functioning better, i do know linux was working on MPO couple of months ago.",Neutral
AMD,Obviously to make people upgrade their gpus.   If they released it instantly they'd get even less sales of their already small amount of gpus shipped,Negative
AMD,"Oh huh. I guess there's either an INT24 fallback, or the compiler generates one for that hardware then. Because I've screenshots on Renoir.",Neutral
AMD,Haven't tried it on windows but I heard reports it has flickering/ghosting issues on RDNA2 but works perfectly on RDNA3,Neutral
AMD,Where to download this from?,Neutral
AMD,With terrible ghosting issues.,Negative
AMD,"Depends on the game. If native uses TAA, it could look better as TAA tends to be a little blurry.",Positive
AMD,"nah, 4000 and 5000 only",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, buggy on windows however but fine on Linux.",Neutral
AMD,"That's just straight up not accurate. Functionally equivalent performance to XESS on a 6900 XT, both as Native AA, and 66% res scale (Tested in FF VII Rebirth.)  With work in optiscaler to configure it appropriately, it means better quality and frame rates, for not that much more cost. (95fps FSR3, 87 XESS and FSR4.)  I already use XESS since it has less ghosting and shimmering than FSR3, in FFVII Rebirth, as my specific example.",Neutral
AMD,"The problem is specific to the INT8 model on Windows on RDNA2. The ghosting isn't present when using the INT8 model or FP8 model on Linux with RDNA2, although FP8 on RDNA2 performs like crap and is totally unusable.",Negative
AMD,What is that,Neutral
AMD,"Hmm. I tested it on my old Vega laptop, and it simply doesn’t work in-game, the screen keeps flickering black and showing severe artifacts.   However, it worked perfectly on my 7900XTX after following the Ancient Gameplays tutorial.",Negative
AMD,"I believe it's emulation, which is pretty bad, like trying to run Xess on very old GPUs without DP4a.",Negative
AMD,"I mean +10-15% perf and might look a little better in some cases sounds like nothing but win, especially for singleplayer games.    I've been meaning to get around to a CP2077 playthrough since I bought a 4k OLED screen, but 4k is a lot of work for a 7900XT.  An extra 10-15% would sure help there.",Positive
AMD,time to see how it does on the steamdeck now...,Neutral
AMD,That's because it's a 6900 XT. The Steam Deck struggles to actually gain much from compute-heavy upscaling like XESS because it's so limited. You see more upscaler gains on high end chips like the 6900 XT.,Neutral
AMD,Has anyone checked if the same issue occurs with RDNA1 or pascal? Apparently this leaked FSR 4 version works on all GPUs like FSR 3.1 does.,Neutral
AMD,"RIP my 6950XT, guess I gotta switch over to Linux come next month",Negative
AMD,how do we get it installed on linux?,Neutral
AMD,XeSS has a dedicated INT24 fallback which older GPUs rely on.,Neutral

So I actually don’t hate this marketing since it’s a valid claim. For 1080p esports gaming, their chips really are among the best at getting such high framerates, especially at their given low power usage.  But if you care about esports gaming you’ll mainly want to pay attention to 1% fps lows. Good news is that the lows also are helped out lots by the cache.

But its the classic marketing ""up to"" thing just like sales with ""up to 70%"", can mean anything from 1 to 1000 FPS, but its okay if AMD does it, not so much if others :D  Just complete marketing bullshit like NVIDIA with MFG enabled in benchmark comparison sheets to previous generations without MFG.",Negative

AMD,"It's not an optimisation issue   Many games have so much more stuff going on than Val/CS. So their CPU requirements will always be more demanding, which translates to lower fps.

AMD,"A faster mouse still makes you faster even with a slow response time.  Your mouse will be part of that response time.

If both you and the enemy have the same reaction time but you have faster hardware, you get the kill. On a game like Valorant (as far as i know who doesn't use timestamps) you hope that that latency reduction brings you into the earliest 7.8 ms  server update window (128 tick server).",Neutral
AMD,"More Hz also means more motion fluidity, so it's easier to spot details when you move the mouse around fast.",Positive

AMD,"What? In a way who cares, he was talking about ue5 not some plug-ins INSIDE ue5",Negative
AMD,"Also we have to consider the reason game dev studios will use UE5 over a more specialised in house engine - because UE5 removes development overheads.  It's natural that if a studio is trying to cut development costs, they likely aren't allocating much resource into engine optimisation work either.  It's why we see small indie studios getting more potential out of UE5 performance:visual wise than the AAA studios. Because the AAA studios are largely just brute forcing it.",Neutral
AMD,A faster monitor works the same because it's also adding to your total latency. (It's about showing you the enemy as early as possible and not about reacting within a single frame). The impact would also be even bigger. A 120 Hz display adds 8.3 ms (more than the Valorant window specified earlier) whereas a 560hz monitor would add less than 2 ms to your total combined latency.,Neutral
AMD,"\>""If both you and the enemy have the same reaction time but you have faster hardware, you get the kill.""  Unless valve intends to run its esports brand more like F1 or similarly technology driven sports, that sounds like a pretty big trade-off for getting rid of the classical systems. Just my initial reaction, my frame of mind. I understand the reason why it's done this way, I think it could of course be improved for the reasons above. Of course the better player should get the benefit, and timing it how they do now improves that. but on the end where your mouse counts..",Neutral
AMD,"The whole reaction time argument is nonsense because when it comes to the mouse polling rate, frame rate, and monitor refreshrate it's all about the latency between your input (mouse motion) and what you perceive on the screen. That's different from reaction time by about an order of magnitude. Removing a few ms polling delay, a few ms render delay, and a few ms monitor delay is now a significant fraction and easily noticeable.",Neutral
AMD,"Blurbusters has shown that there’s significant motion clarity gains up past 1000fps. It’s more than just “it looks smooth” but that there is minimal blurring, judder, ghosting, etc.   Besides that, as fps goes up, latency goes down. At 1000fps, you’ve got a ms between frames. Meaning the game state will update 1ms after you do something. For esports pros in particular, this is a significant advantage. For average joe gamers, it’ll feel pretty good.   Additionally, at 1000fps, you’ve could do BFI at 500fps, or CRT simulation at  333fps and it’d be pretty magical.",Positive
AMD,"Agreed. 144Hz is the sweet spot.   The difference between 60 and 144 Hz is 10ms.   The difference between 144 and 500 Hz is half that much i.e 5ms.   6ms if we move up to 1,000 Hz.   It's all marketing bullshit!",Neutral
AMD,"You call it pointless but provide the counterargument in your own reply.  I play competitive games 95% of the time and my goal with upgrades is to have stable 300+ FPS on my 1080p monitor, which I won't change until my 30s when my priorities shift.  The goal is a more responsive game and motion clarity. I'm perfectly content with my 240hz monitor and a PC that can uphold FPS at that number, but I'm sure I would see a difference at 500 or 1000 hz. The limit isn't my eyes, it's my wallet.   When you look at time between frames, you reduce it by 8 ms going from 60 to 120hz, and by another 7ms when going from 120 to 1000hz. You can see that there are harsh diminishing returns on all of this.",Neutral
AMD,bs take. I have a crt monitor and had a 240hz oled and I could tell the crt was sharper in motion at a paltry 960p.,Neutral
AMD,"nope, it's a common misconception, uncapping framerate overfills the render queue,    nvidia reflex (or amd anti lag) tries to minimize that effect, and it works pretty well but it's still not perfect, capping your framerate 10-15%  below your gpus capability is recommended,    optimum has a pretty in depth video with testing latencies, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHBMxOPAqWc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHBMxOPAqWc)  eg. rtx 2060 (from the video, sadly images not allowed)    120 frame cap (85% gpu load) - 24ms latency   no cap, 147 fps (99% gpu load) - 32 ms latency",Neutral
AMD,"its really not, with a 1000hz monitor sure it would be worth it due to better smoothness, but otherwise, in a vacuum the difference between 360 fps and 1000 fps is 1.7ms (in practice its always a bit higher), your total system latency is as i said 15-20ms at best, usually a bit higher too, not even including your human reaction time which is not gonna be smaller than 100ms even for the best pro players,  we use high refresh rate monitors for smoothness, it makes aiming easier, above certain framerate the latency difference is negligible",Negative

AMD,It was $600 at the start of the year.  Probably went up to $700+ by now.,Neutral
AMD,A laptop RTX 4070 does but I believe that's when both are power limited. It can match a desktop RTX 4060 to get the same performance as the chip does. I don't know why there's an rtx 5060 in my comment. I meant the RTX 4060.,Neutral
AMD,Can it beat it when only running on battery?,Neutral
AMD,"Hard to be sure of the specifics. They are using a more expensive package and motherboard, plus accounting for initial development costs and a low starting volume of units shipped. The internals run at much lower base power than the 9955HX, this thing is a complete fork.  Framework 32GB model is like $1100 usd for a complete system, $800 for only motherboard and the higher memory configurations are where they will take their profits from. I could see a BOM on the mainboard approaching $600+ assembled. People want the 64GB and 128GB systems and will pay market prices to get them.  Yes there is profit-taking on the higher end models, that's how companies profit off of consumers and make money to develop new products. Original Steam Deck was made to break-even at $400 usd acording to Valve, the midrange and top models added like a hundred dollars and hundred-eighty dollars of additional profit. Massive sales of the 512GB Deck gave Valve an incentive to develop the OLED refresh model which has also sold well.  In terms of price, performance and device form factors I am hanging a lot of hope on Medusa Halo. Assuming that MH is not canceled and uses a newer RDNA version, it could be exactly what I am looking for. If it has 50% more memory channels for the 'big' Halo and will accept 192GB of RAM, that thing could be a great system. Too many rumors, claims of hardware changes and memory upgrades.

AMD,"Sure the 13'' and 14'' inch laptop sizes and weights might limit TDP, and thus performance, battery life might not be too great (though from what I've read the HP ZBook Ultra 14 G1a is doing fine wrt. to battery life, and has great performance compared to other laptops - haven'T seen a laptop vs. mini PC benchmark Strix Halo benchmark comparison yet).  But I don't see why that translates into a huge number of mini PCs being announced. For me, an expected solution would be for laptop vendors to release larger, heavier 15'' laptops with higher TDP or larger batteries, etc.  After all, Strix Halo is currently the only non-Apple APU in its class. So if your company is not called Apple, but wants to offer the best CPU performance in a laptop, Strix Halo is the only practical choice.",Neutral
AMD,"There's no way.  The GPU/IO die is the most expensive part to produce, and it's 308mm² which is smaller than the Navi48 chip in a 9070XT. The rest of it is two compute dies at 70.6mm². Board partners can build the entire 9070XT including VRAM, cooler, power delivery etc and sell at $600.  So the question is how much are Minisforum etc buying the APUs from AMD, but AMD's BOM on the APU is definitely not $600.",Negative
AMD,"I mean, how much is power efficiency even worth?  Oh right, there is... all of... that :: gestures to Apple as a company ::",Neutral
AMD,"Larger laptops tend toward having a dGPU so the first models with Halo were smaller. Then you can compare them against Razer blades and other compact designs. It wasn't a bad idea but I keep seeing people talk about Homelab and how much storage can they attach to these things. Any design with a low core count or less than 64GB of RAM may as well be a regular Ryzen 370 (and those models have the motherboard support for a dGPU).  Side note, I saw that Corsair has a 385 with 64GB for $1600 and I was a little tempted.  Rumors have been floating about a possible ""big Halo"" and ""little Halo"" if the line is continued. If true, little Halo should be cheaper than current stuff and big Halo could be much faster. This also depends whether we see AMD shipping as small as possibly 2nm product in their consumer division. I trust MLID even less than his net worth, but 2nm could give us a 'small' monolithic APU that's 50% faster than a 370 in both multicore and graphics performance...if you can afford it. Rumors about the big chip could mean a higher max TDP but also 40% or more improvement in performance over Strix Halo.

AMD,"C-states are cool I guess (pun not intended) but in my measurements there is a much bigger difference between P0 and P1 than between P1 and C2.  A near-idling Threadripper virtual machine host spends 2% of its time in P0 and 98% in C, and uses lots of power. If I forbid P0, it will spend 2% of its time in P1 and 98% in C, and use one-fourth of the power - at obviously no cost to performance because it's idling anyway.  If *that* could happen automatically, imagine the power saving across the board...  And by ""that"" I mean every wake-up from C-state should go to P1 first, and then be upgraded to P0 if it lasts long enough. What happens now is that every tiny interrupt goes to P0, and the CPU immediately goes to Precision Boost mode, ramping up voltages and clocks to maximum (especially since power budgets are overflowing) - only to go back to C0 a microsecond later.  And since there is only one voltage shared between all cores, any single core's P0 makes *all* cores enjoy the high voltage, even if they are themselves sleeping.

AMD,The bad optimisation critics aremostly people trying to sound smart by rambling things they dont understand.  Game engines are very optimized these days.   Its funny they mostly pick on Unreal Engine 5 as the prime example... That is probably the most complete game engine out there. So naturally its hard to make all that stuff work well togetter... They have litterally some of the best coders and researchers in the business ... Id love to see you do a better job.,Negative
AMD,Mixed cores are awesome if the scheduler would do what i want and there lies the problem and i dont think even AI can solve that yet.,Negative
AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative
AMD,"I play Warthunder almost daily. It’s ridiculously fucking optimized.   I got cyberpunk when it came out, it was a shit show. Elden ring? Mediocre.  Escape from tarkov? Fucking laughable.

AMD,Never count out Intel. They have some very talented people over there.,Positive
AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.

AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.

AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive

AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there.

AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores.

AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.

AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral

AMD,"It shouldn't become an entry level workstation part since the Ryzen 9 will have 24c/48t to go against it.   48 cores (plus the 4 LPe, but those shouldn't factor in too much) should handily beat 48 threads, but not by enough to reach Threadripper territory.",Neutral
AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral
AMD,"Lmao, some of my games still runs on e cores",Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Positive
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral
AMD,"As a advice, Nova Lake will further increase memory latency.",Negative
AMD,In which gen iteration?,Neutral
AMD,Editorialized. But its funny because said quote is attributed to AMD when Intel made Core2Duo (or Quad?),Neutral
AMD,"If its is with 10% of threadripper 9960x at half the price, it will definitely hurt the low end threadripper cpus a lot for productivity/creator types who would love a more reasonable priced high performance entry level workstaion. Low end workstation is probably bigger market than high end gaming desktops anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral
AMD,That is more so bc the 9950x3d isn’t really a 16 core cpu it is two 8 cores,Neutral
AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral
AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral

Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability.

Not to mention they did shady business like keep doing rebranding old chip as the new series to fools people into thinking it was new architecture when it wasn't and sell it with higher price compared to chip on the same architecture in old gen.  Intel surely needed to kick Amd ass because Amd keep milking people with the same 6 and 8 cores CPU over and over with price increases too!

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.

AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral

AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral

AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.

Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral

AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).   I don't think Intel can also build out Foveros-Direct at scale just yet, considering they are having problems launching it for just CLF too.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm an e-core hater but arrow lake e-cores are really performant and make up for the loss of HT. arl/nvl 4+8 would wildly beat 6c12t adl/rpl.  HT was always a fallacy anyway. If you load up every thread, your best possible performance is ~60% of a core for a games main-thread.  I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I somewhat agree with this. I suppose it depends if Intel’s latency problem with their P+E core design is at all a fixable one - 4c/8t is still shockingly serviceable for gaming, but 4c/4t absolutely is not.",Neutral

AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience. I'm speaking from experience since I also have a fully tuned 9950x3D/5090 on my testbench. For productivity task Intel feels much better to use as well. I feel like Intel is just better optimized for Windows and Productivity too.",Positive

On MSI Claw 8 AI+, Lunar Lake temp at 20w is just arround 62c while the Amd version is arround 70c.

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

AMD,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Negative

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue. Keep me posted on what you find with that CPU usage spike and reliability monitor - those are likely our smoking guns!",Neutral
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification. For anyone building new systems, Intel recommends using RST instead of VROC, but existing X299 users can continue using VROC with supported drives from the qualified vendor list. ***Support is now limited to sustaining mode with no new features or drive certifications planned, as confirmed in the support article you referenced.***",Neutral

Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work.
