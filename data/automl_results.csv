Intel,I thought that was Denis lol,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah this is a really surprisingly open factory tour, at least compared to when Sapphire took Linus and Alex along. It feels unprecedented to see this much access and insight, but that's the goodwill nurtured by Steve paying off in spades. The lament about AMD and Nvidia ditching the sub-250 side is real, so having Arc actually be a usable option down here is going to be significant later on.",Positive
Intel,"Pretty good video with a lot of detail I haven't seen in previous factory tours. I probably still won't use an Intel GPU for gaming, but for a media server it's probably sufficient.  Side note: It's funny how whenever a GN video gets posted, the same cast of characters comes out and writes essays criticizing the video, apparently without watching it. I guess that's what it means to ""make it"".",Positive

Intel,"To be fair this is not a clean room, just SMT assembly. Basically, soldering components. A lose hair might be a bit of a problem (kind of like in any factory), but his hair is tied and doesn't seem to be an issue.

Intel,"Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket. To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of similar performance or even outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,"> Love how 5050 is actually at msrp now cheapest b580 is $349+  Just an FYI but B&H has the [Acer Nitro B580 for $249.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1874395-REG/acer_dp_z4bww_p01_nitro_oc_arc_b580.html) and the [Intel Limited Edition model for $259.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1869297-REG/intel_31p06hb0ba_arc_b580_limited_edition.html). So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

Intel,This sub is genuinely weird. They complain about PCMR when the level of discourse here is much worse and a lot more mean spirited.,Negative
Intel,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them.

Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

Yes, they are different product classes, but Panther Lake SKUs that have 10-12 Xe3 cores will most definitely be >$1000 with laptops.

At CES, there are surprisingly dGPUs still being paired with Panther Lake, heck, Strix Halo was designed purely for it's iGPU, even the engineers stand by this (PCIe slots are being released in miniPCs because that's what the market wants).  Also, this ""big APU"" argument is based on chiplets/tiles. Strix Halo isn't monolithic, same as Panther Lake. They both have the same design strategy that makes it economically viable to tape out in the first place.

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral

Intel,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral

Intel,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral

Intel,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
Intel,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core.

Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
Intel,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive

Intel,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral

Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative

Intel,"Well, I think that most people (myself included) don't really care how it's done if the end result is looking good and feel good to play, off course something like 30fps based with MFG to 120 is bs, but I quite regularly use 60 -> 120 using frame gen because It feels okay input wise to me at 60, and the added visual smoothness is quite nice.

Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral

Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative

It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Negative
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, it does bring SOME changes to the cores, both are a next generation, it just isn't a more radical change like will be happening with NVL.  A mid single digit improvement is still pretty decent.",Positive

Intel,It runs for far too short a time to reflect accurate multi-core performance.  People don't get a multitude of cores to run a task for a few seconds.

To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

Intel,"18A has always been low density, but expected to compensate for it with very efficient frequency scaling past peak perf/W. It was always going to struggle in laptops, where you rarely push past the best perf/W due to thermal and battery constraints.  Wait for the desktop/server chips before you call it. With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump. I'd expect 65W to 105W on 18A to yield 20-25% due to the benefits of BPD.",Neutral

That makes me optimistic about the improvement opportunity in a more mature 18A if they can chase down these issues, and perhaps even more in 18AP if they can clean up these bugs.  If they have a 'double upgrade' opportunity in both fixing the discovered 18A issues and implementing the originally planned 18AP improvements then it could end up being a somewhat bigger jump.  Don't think it'll be an N2 beater though.  18AP *might* beat the best of N3 in some applications, we'll see.  For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,"If the B580 has good performance in the game that you are interested in then it can be a good option. However, in some games there are driver overhead issues. So you cant trust every benchmark with a 7800x3d/9800x3d to estimate the GPU performance. In some games performance is reduced with a Ryzen 5 5600 for example. If this has been fixed in your games (or you have a stronger CPU) then the b580 is a good choice.",Positive

Intel,"So the 9th gen is a bit of a weird CPU right now, you do have a couple of decent upgrade options, but also you cannot go past the 9th gen without a new motherboard. Also the 9th gen is quickly coming up on 6 years old now as well.   My affordable advice would be to grab a 9700k and a better CPU cooler, then you can start to worry about the GPU which is very PSU dependent anyways. Without knowing the PSU I cant really make a suggestion anyways.   But the truth is, I would almost start fresh. New mobo, cpu, PSU and GPU. It would be more pricy, but also a far better use of your money than dumping it into a system that will be too slow to run new games in just a year or two.",Neutral

Intel,"All the games you play avoid the problem of having a weak but modern gpu very well. Assuming you dont suddenly decide to play something more graphically intensive i reccomend upgrading your cpu seeing how it feels, then upgrading your gpu. The immediate option that comes to mind is the i5 9400f. It should be an approximate 25%-30% improvement in most of the games like cs2 due to the added cores, threads and clock speed compared to that fairly weak i3 cpu. Then you could do something like an RX 6600 for $120 if findable, if not I usually reccomend the 3060 12gb as a braindead midrange option still able to play anything, it's about 200.",Neutral

Intel,"What is your budget for upgrades?  Your GPU is currently being held back by your platform. The 6500XT only has PCIe x4, and LGA 1151 only has PCIe 3.0. 3.0x4 bottlenecks the card pretty badly, going from on par with an RX 580 to worse than an RX 570. Getting onto a newer platform with PCIe 4.0 would improve both your CPU and GPU.",Negative
Intel,"What you could/should upgrade depends entirely on budget. The CPU is nearly the slowest 9th gen Intel chip, so an upgrade there would help a lot. The ""Best In Slot"" CPU is the i9-9900K but those go for nearly $200 on eBay. You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game. The GPU is also the slowest of the 6000 series. As far as new GPUs go, the Intel Arc B580 12GB at $250-$300 or the Radeon RX 9060XT 16GB at $380-$400 are best bang for the buck on the cheaper side, your options really open up on the used market. Go to the [Techpowerup specs page](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6500-xt.c3850) and check out the Relative Performance of your card with faster ones. I would upgrade to something at least 200% relative performance or higher if you can afford it. Between the GPU and CPU, I'd say the GPU upgrade should take priority over CPU. While a much newer GPU might be bottlenecked by the 9100F, its vastly superior performance will leave the 6500XT in the dust. GTX 1080ti (\~$150) RTX 2080ti (\~240) RTX 3060ti (\~$220-250) RX 6750XT ($280-350) RX 6800 (\~$300) RTX 3080 (\~$350) all examples of decent used options that are considerably more powerful than the 6500.",Neutral
Intel,Adding a 9700K isn’t gonna fix the fact the GPUs being bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  An R5 3600 and a cheap B550 board would probably cost not much more than an 9700K and improve the GPUs performance quite a bit. It would still work with the 16GB DDR4 they already have.,Negative
Intel,I have seen many videos on how it is a bad card I haven’t had no problems so far but definitely on my list,Negative
Intel,LGA 1700 isn’t worth recommending at all. DDR4 performance has aged terribly because newer games are more memory demanding. DDR4 boards have also gone up in price a lot.   HUB revisited the Ryzen 5000 series last week and included a 12400F on DDR4 and DDR5 for comparison (https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=NbuCRlSV4uhHOzlv) - the 12400F on DDR4 performs closer to an R5 5500 nowadays than the R5 5600 it used to compete with.,Neutral

Intel,"What? A lot of the review coverage for the 6500XT was about how bad the PCIe bottleneck is. The 6400 and 6500XT are unique in that they’re PCIe x4, even current lower-end cards like the Arc B570 and RTX 5050 are PCIe x8  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-pci-express-scaling/28.html TPU saw a 24% drop from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p  https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/ Techspot saw a 22% drop in averages and 25% drop in lows from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p   I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s even worse nowadays, games demand more VRAM now than they did 4 years ago. More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.  If you don’t know what you’re talking about, don’t comment lol",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m not stupid.  You are far better off going for Zen 3 over anything on LGA 1700.   The R5 5600(X) performs as well with DDR4 as the 12400(F) does with DDR5.  Used they both go for ~$100-120, new both are ~$170 right now. AM4 boards tend to be cheaper and the RAM is the exact same.  Why would you spend more on LGA 1700 to get worse performance?",Neutral
Intel,"My real-world experience with low-end cpu power and this mismatch on those titles is 10%. It isnt worse than having that i3 does to cpu-bound situations. Upgrading a bad platform is probabaly not his best price to dollar, but it is the nuanced situation he's in. if he can sell what he has for the price it goes for, going ryzen is always correct. However his cpu and all the others here are bad. If he can simply get a better part price on a single chip, he can get equivalent value from the upgrade compared to going ryzen.",Negative
Intel,You can get an i5 13600k with better performance than a 5800x. Also it is difficult to find the AM4 X3D CPUs these days so the intel route makes sense. He can later upgrade to a 14900k even which no AM4 CPU can match in terms of performance,Positive
Intel,"Weren’t you recommending upgrading to a 9400F?  Sure, the 9100F might be the limiting factor right now, but you’re still gonna hit the same PCIe bottleneck. It’s just gonna be more pronounced.",Neutral
Intel,"13th gen pricing is crap so I’ll use 14th gen for comparison, it’s basically the same  14600KF is $245 new and $180-200 used. It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.  Going Intel over AMD would cost at least $60 extra and most of the performance gains you would see using DDR5 on the 14600KF would be wiped out using DDR4",Negative

Intel,"There is a high-end bias with this platform, like any. It helps a lot to understand that budget systems fall within their spec, it is only the highest-end and lowest-end options of this era that stretch the pcie issue... there are cycles of alarmist narritives in all media. That one is old news that likely shouldnt have been printed imo.",Neutral
Intel,You’re going to hit the large PCIe bottleneck the moment the CPU isn’t terrible. It’s not gonna take much of a CPU upgrade for a GPU worse than an RX 570 to become the issue.,Negative

Intel,Youre giving me nothing against the clear narritives youre following over substance of experience with this shitty level of cpu performance.,Negative
Intel,"Do you respect at all the starting position he is in or are u just an advice salesman? Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct. The only bad advice here wastes more time and money than his original choice of platform already sealed. Also ur just wrong about pcie bottlenecks im pretty sure",Neutral
Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0. That’s not opinion, that’s fact. That loss is going to be the same regardless of how good or bad your CPU is as long as the CPU isn’t the bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,I genuinely wonder what u get living in the idealized world where pcie 3.0 sucks ass below the highest-end 4.0 products and visa-versa. My dad was rly into the ideas of mearsheimer and I luckily biocontained his ass before that fkers gone and made the meme rounds again. You listen to Armand Hammer?,Negative
Intel,"Yea. Your advice is fine and wasnt the target of my statements, I added the last comment as proof I agree a platform swap is a totally good option. He doesnt even need to change his cooler for a 9400f and can then get a normal gpu for a similar value to his current one. This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement. His pc can gain value whilst spending little, my option is simply the lowest I coukd imagine.",Positive

I think the Wraith Prism does the job but is just not the best, there are many better options for cheap.   I had my doubts with this cooler as it has very few reviews and is not a double tower. Most of the commonly recommended coolers (looking at you Peerless Assassin) weren't available here, and other popular ones didn't have enough clearance for the big heat sinks in my RAM sticks.

Intel,Just buy two Arctic P12 for $7 each and use those instead. I did that on my AIO and it dramatically improved both temps and noise.  Also you can probably run the pump at 70% without issues. Mine only ramps up to 100% at 80C.,Neutral
Intel,"The fans max out at 2000 rpm, and wide open they're actually not that bad.  My PC is in my living room, and I can run Handbrake, Cinebench, etc and it doesn't interfere with watching TV or anything like that.  Of course there are quieter fans, and some people can tolerate noise better than others, but for the $$ spent, it's hard to beat.  I agree with the other reply, if you happen to get this AIO and the stock fans are too noisy for you, just swap them out with something from Arctic.  Also note, that the pump on the Frozen Notte is not PWM, so it runs at 100% at all times, but it's not noisy to me.",Neutral
Intel,"Also wanted to say that, if you want to customize your fan, download the program called FanControl and you should be able to lower the noise level.",Neutral
Intel,"My dual CCD 5800x (which runs about 5+C cooler than single CCD 5800x that have a fairly more warped IHS) wasn't kept in check by the wraith prism at all. Also the minimum RPM was like 1200 and it was loud as hell. While it's certainly the best stock cooler in recent production, it's completely useless against sub 50$ aftermarkets.",Negative
Intel,"I had money to spend so I got the new Corsair link and went ham on RGB. I spent some hours and had fun with different lights and themes.  It filled the itch and curiosity.  On spec, it seemed better than Arctic P12 (literally had P12 ARGB versions previously), but actual execution on cooling has been pretty disappointing. I had mines set to quiet, but course still hear pump noise.  If I ever do a next PC build, I prob go back to doing silent build again or a mini PC. Arctic P12 Pro is a much better design that addresses issues the original P12 had.  Though I am curious about Thermalright TL-12 performing better at lower RPM range than Arctic P12s.",Positive
Intel,"I have the Wraith Prism in one of my systems and I can barely hear the fan unless I really stress the CPU. I moved it into my HTPC to watch movies and play games and it is basically inaudible during quiet movie scenes.    It certainly would lose to any $50 aftermarkets. It would lose out to even a cheap $35-$40 Thermalright. However, it should still be perfectly sufficient to run a 105W cpu like a 2700X or 5800X.   The fact that his 5800X idles at 47'C suggests something is wrong with the cooler, TP, or the installation. A 5800X at idle consumes about the same power and gives off the same heat as the 5600X, 3600X, 5800X3D, 5700X3D, and 5700X. I've had almost every single one of these CPUs and my chips all ran in the high 20s 'C to low 30s 'C idle with ambient temps of around 21-25.5'C (70 to 78'F).",Negative
Intel,What issues did the original P12 have?,Neutral
Intel,"Or maybe it's the case (and it may explain the higher idle temp), there are a few revisions of the prism that had a lower RPM minimum threshold, mine was stuck at an obnoxiously high minimum RPM that made it loud and clear. In fact a few days later the Be Quiet DRP4 finally came and I got rid of the prism, but I'm quite picky with fan noise",Neutral
Intel,"I used P12 in various build for years. It's my go to.  The only problem is bearing noise after a year, even after cleaning.  My last build was strictly be quiet case fans mad had been quiet since then.",Negative
Intel,Even after they switched to FDB? My P12s have been whisper quiet for a couple years now.,Negative
Intel,"I think your whisper quiet is my ""noisey"" lol.  When I had the P12 ARGB, that one is based on P12 Pro, did not exhibit noise.   Before my full $$$$ Corsair RGB build, I always had what I call ""dead silent"" builds. Like the computer would be 2nd or 3rd noisiest thing in the room even while gaming. Not the fast CPU and GPU, but can still have a high performance.  My haswell build 10 years ago had a large CPU heatsink no fan.  The original P12 has always had a balance issue when standing vertical position. If ran for 4 hours a day daily, after a year, I can hear the noise would increase and be a really faint bearing noise.  This is NOT an issue with P12 ARGB and P12 Pro as they have a revised fan design and I would totally recommend them over the original P12.   As for me thinking about Thermalright and Be Quiet, that is mainly to get the most amount of airflow with least amount of sound possible. I have seen YouTube videos of guys testing these at 800rpm and 1000rpm tests and Arctic is usually behind those fans (not a large margin, but still great on price per performance).",Neutral
Intel,Are you sure those issues persisted after they switched to FDB though? I know there was an annoying high pitched noise on their DBB fans.,Negative
Intel,"You can always get a 5070ti and increase the resolution. A better AM4 x3dCPU will be very hard to find for a proper price at the moment.   If you don't plan to play on 1440p, you're fine with your current setup.",Neutral
Intel,I have a 5600x and a 5070 and in 1440p it pairs very well. Im not 100% sure how well a 5600x would hold a 5070Ti but it should work good as well.  If you do upgrade to a 5070/5070Ti I would exclusively play in 1440p  The CPU usage in arc raiders is normal for our generation of CPU. Yes its bottlenecking but since your GPU is still high (80-95%) its not a hard bottleneck.   Also the difference from a 5600x to a 5800XT is like a 2% difference I would not waste money on a new CPU unless you can find a AM4 X3D for CHEAP.   Id do a 5070 and run it for a few years. Im very happy with how I perform in games.,Positive
Intel,I’ve been playing on 1440p most games except cs2 which I run on 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,I was actually meaning the ryzen 7 5800x3d. Seems like that would be around a 10% ish maybe more improvement over the 5600x. I like your suggestion. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,The 5070TI should be a good and meaningful upgrade for you at 1440p.,Positive
Intel,Also just realized the $200 sticker was for a 5800x not an x3d which is going upwards of $400-500 INSANE. Will probably save money and upgrade the gpu first.,Neutral
Intel,"i mean from what i know it think it’s good, honestly if you’re looking for those graphics i would say maybe a better gpu and possibly cpu, make sure to double check that you have access to ethernet to where you are in your home otherwise you’ll need a wifi motherboard. the ram might be an issue for some games and also you most likely won’t need that much storage, my 2tb (lol tb) storage fits me just fine with having multiple games in the hundreds like red dead. also if you’re upgrading see how much storage takes up with different games which can give you an estimate of how much or just count all the games haha. otherwise i think you’re fine",Positive
Intel,"Stay way from AsRock AM5 motherboards (they fry AMD CPUs). 7600X is a better CPU for a similar price. That GPU is not a good idea (expensive, old and low VRAM).

Intel,I have router on shelf right next to me that connected to laptop so internet wont be a problem (I still gonna buy the wifi adapter tho). Two of my feinds have 16GB of RAM and they play games that I listed above (and the others) more than fine. I will still of course upgrade my RAM in the future. I chose RX 6600 XT cuz I heard that it was good card with powers between 3060 and Ti. Def gonna upgrade it. And I chose 7500F because I think its a good start for a mid pc on AM5 probably gonna keep it for the longest  P.S Yeah I think im gonna buy smaller HDD but I want to start study video editing and modeling so I might still get 4TB.,Positive
Intel,the asrock motherboards are more or less fine now and it was mainly x3d chips that were the issue but they released bios updates and it should be fine now and they are great cheap motherboards with decent features,Positive
Intel,"Option 1 is definitely the way to go, you'll get so much better performance boost for your money.  While an X3D chip would be nice, they are in short supply and incredibly expensive for what you get.  Edit: You can also use DLSS on the 3070 to play games at 4K on the TV. It should look a lot better.",Positive
Intel,"For gaming purposes I think option A makes the most sense. The 5600x is a good cpu still, and you’ll see bigger performance upgrades all around this way. That’s in terms of FPS for games if what you want is maybe more performance for desktop applications then maybe go B or consider am5 for one of them.",Positive
Intel,Buy a 5070ti for your pc and put the 3070 inside yourgf's PC,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, CPU is fine on both. I’d look into the 9070 upgrade.",Positive
Intel,"Option 1. I don't think you should bring hunting down and overpaying for an X3D CPU. Staying with AM4 is about cost savings, not hunting a rare jewel and spending a fortune.",Neutral
Intel,"Rig 1 doesn't need an upgrade imo.  Rig 2 yeah the GPU maybe could size however I imagine you still okay fairly well on it anyway.  Option 1 makes the most sense of the two. You both get an upgrade with only needing one purchase.  That said, nowt wrong with a 3070 at all, specially for the use case.  Upgrade rig 2 to a 3070 if you can find one could be the cheaper option, but only one rig gets the upgrade.  So back to option 1 so you both get the upgrade feel.",Positive
Intel,"Option A and call it good. You'll have a hard time finding AM4 X3D, and by the time that you do, it'd be cheaper to go AM5 because scalpers gonna scalp. Also, going to a 3060 or 3060 Ti is a waste of money at this point. You'd be better off going to an RX 9060 XT 16GB instead of RTX 3060/3060 Ti.  Truthfully though, I'd look for a Ryzen 5 9600X and B650/B850 combo with RAM, and then go to a 9070 XT for your first. You can do a combo builder on Newegg and get CPU, mobo, and 32GB of RAM for $678 USD. Add an 850W PSU like an Montech Century II for 90 bucks, and you're laughing. At very least, it'll give your 3070 a bit more room to stretch its legs.  In saying that, Maybe sell off your other rig, and use it to offset the cost of a 9070 XT. Then, you can use your primary as your secondary. You can cheap out on a case for it and re-use your current one for the new stuff. Montech's X5/X5M are dirt cheap, look good, and give plenty of airflow. The included fans are SATA and non-PWM, but they're not noisy enough to be a pain, and they have a regular 5V ARGB header.  I just did a build in the X5M with a 9600X and 9060 XT 16GB, and the max temps with a Montech NX400 cooler(also dirt cheap) in that case under a 1-hour all-core stress test was 72°C. It's a definite recommend to save money on any build without sacrificing airflow...and it has USB-C on the front I/O",Neutral
Intel,Do you live near a microcenter?,Neutral
Intel,"Upgrade 1 will give you more fps because of the faster gpu, and with a gain of 10-15% from a 5800x to x3d with a 5090 at 1080p low, (hardware unboxed video yesterday) I´d rather opt for a search for a used cheap 5800x to add some clocks and  2 cores to your main system  Upgrade 2 will do nothing for the first system and you get a new gpu for the second one.",Positive
Intel,"Exactly this.  At 1440p and especially at 4k, it is the GPU that is doing most of the heavy lifting.  BUT, I always recommend that you use Adrenaline or some other hardware monitor to see what the utilization of both the CPU and GPU is during game play where you think you could benefit most from better performance.  That will tell you what component is maxing out and should be upgraded first.",Neutral
Intel,"Or...sell off Rig 1 and do the AM5/9070 XT build and keep Rig 2 and upgrade the GPU later. The reason that I say go AM5 9600X, is because it performs close to AM4 X3D chips in most games...sometimes better.",Neutral
Intel,unfortunately i am no where near an MC,Negative
Intel,Appreciate your thoughtful input. I wasn’t aware of the  closeness in performance of AM5 9600x vs  AM4 x3d. I’ll do some more research on that front.  For now I’m leaning towards getting just a 5070ti now and waiting another year or so to upgrade rig 1 to AM5.,Neutral
Intel,Boo ok was going to say it would be cheaper to buy a mobo combo than upgrade to an x3d on AM4 those are getting pretty expensive used.,Neutral
Intel,"Hardware Unboxed did a 5800X3d/5700X3D revisit the other day, most of the time, it was within 5-7% of them in games.",Neutral
Intel,"considering rampocalypsis  if u can get an 5700x3d or 5800x3d (dont know if ali express still are), and maybe a 9060xt or 5060 (16gb both of them) u can get a nice upgrade that will last a few more years, at least untill the rampocalypsis finish and u can do a proper upgrade ( if u wanted a more powerfull GPU i would suggest buying a new PSU)  and even with the rampocalypsis, maybe u are interested in a new pair of 8Gb ram stiscks ddr4 and bump the ram up to 32Gb",Positive
Intel,"Sell your old PC. Then buy a new one if you get a reasonable price, especially for RAM that can easily take most of your budget for DDR5 32 gb.",Neutral
Intel,your cpu can push a much better gpu to its limit in 1440p gaming...  just get a 9060xt 16gb gpu and wait for ddr5 prices to come back to earth...,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly I've spent about 448 euro to upgrade my girlfriends 2600x and GTX1660 super to a 5800x and RTX 5060, night and day difference and she can pretty much play anything modern again at 60-144fps depending on the game with decent settings.  I'd get a decent 750 watt PSU with a 5070Ti and you'll still have money left for a 5800x3D if you can find one. That alone sounds like a better long term deal than settling for a 5070 instead.  Sidenote: why is your post written with AI?",Positive
Intel,I'd upgrade it alltogether. In my opinion if you want to upgrade cooling/storage it's fine but if you get into gpu/cpu territory it's not that worth it because upgrading a cpu is limited to what your mobo is compatible with. Besides when you want significantly more performance you'd upgrade the mobo with cpu then you think you want a better gpu and you will end up with an entirely new pc at the end but you will blueball yourself with performance along the way so it's best to build/buy a new one once and have it behind you.,Neutral
Intel,"for upgrade gpu lead to need more cpu power too, should consider cpu in am4 system that can match with 5070ti",Neutral
Intel,I'd rather buy or build a new pc.,Neutral
Intel,"lets say u upgraded ur current, if u can find a reasonable price or find it at all the 5700x3d/5800x3d, then thermalrights peerless assassin 120se/phantom spirit 120se, plus montech century II 850w, plus the rx 9070 xt, u should have around 400-500€ left and the pc would be better than the 5070 prebuilt,",Neutral
Intel,"I've previously upgraded the GPU (970 to 4070) in an older system (5820K from 2014) and was happy with the improvement. I wanted to buy a GPU whilst they were easily available, and affordable to me, so I ordered a 4070 FE on release day in April 2023, to pair with a new 4K VRR-capable monitor. My intent was always to take it with me to my next system, which I eventually did in November 2025.  Whilst I probably didn't get every ounce of performance out of it whilst it was in that 5820K system, it was still a massive improvement, and necessary for making good use of the 4K monitor.  I should note, however, that my old system already had a capable 850W PSU. If I'd had to upgrade the PSU, I likely would not have bothered, as I find recabling a labour-intensive job that I'd rather not do.  In your place, I think your 450W PSU restricts you, unless you feel very differently to me about upgrading it. I wouldn't upgrade the GPU to anything needing much more than the 1070Ti's 180W, which would limit you to a 5060Ti or 9060XT which should both offer about a 2x improvement. You may feel that you'd rather pay a bit more and get a far more capable GPU, with a bit more headroom, however.",Positive
Intel,Prebuilt PC specs? If it's on am5 with 32gb of RAM that's likely the best choice.  What resolution and refresh rate is your monitor?,Positive
Intel,Absolutely getting the prebuilt. Sell the old if you want to recoup some of the cost.  You can move the old HDD into the prebuilt if it doesn't come with one (as I assume it doesn't),Neutral
Intel,"""I’ve always upgraded my old PC piece by piece"" This is always a bad idea and it just means you didn't build a well balanced PC, but rather that some components were big overkill, so you had headroom to upgrade other components that were the wrong choice initially.   Always save money until you can buy entire new PC, and build it so well with components of similar relative power so that any upgrade would make no sense. That's how you make the most for your money, get the most performance and it also eases up selling/gifting old PC as a bonus.  So always the answer is buy entire PC (either pre-built which is nowadays a decent option, or all components needed separately and build it yourself), now whether you can find satisfactory PC for your budget is something only you know, but worst case scenario just save up more money if you need better PC - but always buy at once everything.",Negative
Intel,AliExpress still has some for the small price of 500-600 € for the 5800X3D 😭,Neutral
Intel,"This would be my first low risk avenue as well. But keep in mind I've got other things to spend my money on, so I'm always looking for dollar efficiency.   That GPU is the weak point.  If you find new have are having trouble in two or three years you can always do a full upgrade.",Neutral

Intel,"English isn't my native language either. Just write it down in broken English if you have to, you'll learn more and nobody should shame you for it. AI can be a great tool, but don't let it get in your way of learning a new language.",Neutral
Intel,"What is ""budgeting"" in this context? And yes, there is something wrong with upgrading as you go, and I explained why. It means PC was not built to be balanced, relative power of components didn't match eachother, you had big bottlenecks as long as there is headroom for meaningful upgrade (meaning you never saw the full potential of your CPU because GPU was too bad for it, if you have the headroom to upgrade just GPU).  If you have the ability to meaningfully upgrade some component - it means you picked the wrong components in the 1st place, and wasted money on those overkills for no reason, since you were limited by worse components so you could never enjoy them. By the time you get to upgrade one or two components - you'd be better off if you saved money for entirely new PC cos now you can get for the same cost newer components that you picked as overkill. You get the idea.  Upgrading ""as you go"" is wrong, sorry. It means your PC was not well built and that you either overspent for some components (if they are overkill and leave headroom for other components to be upgraded) - or underspent for those weaker ones.",Negative
Intel,"You're delusional, bottlenecks aren't a thing out of the extremes and purely dependent on what you do with the system.  The 'headroom for upgrade' comes from hardware manufacturers, not your system being 'unbalanced'.  You are objectively wrong, and I'm going to tell you why in the case of upgrading CPU + GPU:  * End cost is \*the same\* * You get increased performance while waiting to afford the other part * More time spent with higher performance  The only counterpoint from here is you providing evidence that running an ""unoptimal"" system is harmful to the hardware.  edit: Fantastic argument, I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation :-)  edit2: Blocking actually isn't a great look although it can personally save you some dignity when things get uncomfortable.

Money wasted. Argument dismissed.  Correct! I don't think I made any statement to the contrary, that falls under my ""out of the extremes"" and ""dependent on use-case"" comments I made! :)  That would result in no performance increases in gaming.  As a reminder, the poster is planning to upgrade his GPU and he will see massive increases across the board compared to his 1070 Ti. Can you provide evidence to support that switching from the 1070 Ti to a 5070 Ti would result in lower fps, freezes and stutters?",Negative

Intel,So nothing newer than the RX 6600?  And what is your mobo and PSU?,Neutral
Intel,GIGABYTE GA-A320M-S2H motherboard and 500w psu,Neutral
Intel,"There are multiple revs of that mobo model. If resizeable bar (or whatever Gigabyte calls it) is currently not available in your BIOS version, you may need to incrementally update BIOS (and you may need to do it all the way to the most recent). Check after each update; the Gigabyte site is showing that incremental updates are necessary...read the notes.  500W PSU will limit your GPU options. What is/are the PCIe connector(s) available from that PSU?",Neutral
Intel,"I replied a bit late but i just updated my BIOS to the latest version, i will check if theres a resizeable bar in my motherboard. My PICe connector is 2 + 6 connector i think",Neutral
Intel,"If rebar exists, then you have 50 watts to spare and the connector for the ARC B580 aside from the overhead that may be there with the 1600...",Neutral
Intel,so should i go for it? even if i dont have rebar (i still didnt check it its 1 am) i will upgrade my cpu in a month,Neutral
Intel,ok i just checked it and it does have rebar,Neutral
Intel,Then the overhead issue with the Ryzen 5 1600 is the remaining concern...and that may be game dependent.,Neutral
Intel,DDU ?,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't be getting worse performance at all. Did you run DDU to uninstall your old Nvidia drivers? Often switching from Nvidia to AMD and vice versa can cause issues like this.,Negative
Intel,most shooter games rely on cpu and your running a 2018 cpu with a 2025 gpu not really a big problem just prob being bottlenecked you also may be running arc raiders with nvidia settings while using a amd card,Neutral
Intel,"You're cpu bottlenecked. You can increase graphics settings. This won't increase your fps, but it might improve stutters and it will give you free graphics improvements.",Neutral
Intel,Is the GPU at 100% utilization?  Are you vram limited?,Neutral
Intel,"yes, nothing change after DDU or Windows Reinstall",Neutral
Intel,"i already trying this too, same FPS on LOW and EPIC",Neutral
Intel,"You can also set a fps cap, lower it a bit until you no longer see stutters.",Neutral
Intel,fps cap can't help because FPS are going to 45 to 70 to fast,Negative
Intel,Then you just need to set it low enough. Otherwise you'll keep facing stutters.,Neutral
Intel,There is no way this setup runs battlefield 6 on more than 60 fps,Negative
Intel,All them cards will work fine with your motherboard. The pcie generations are not that much of a issue in actual performance. The issue I do seeing u having is CPU not really keeping up. But you can go up too 5000 AMD just flash your bios before hand. 3080 GPUs are good at 1080 and 1440p. But you will have to upgrade PSU to 850w. You can upgrade GPU first and see if your happy or not and than upgrade CPU later. The 5060 will use less power than a 3080,Neutral
Intel,"You may gotta think also that your CPU seems to be a possible bottleneck cause.  I researched, and as long as your motherboard has a **rebar feature**, your above PCIe gen GPU should work fine. For this, you gotta update your BIOS.  So said that, I'd advice you to upgrade your CPU to a 5600/X and to look for an used GPU, like a RTX 2600 12GB! And maybe to play in 1440p.",Neutral
Intel,dont bother w the gen5 things . i have an r5 5600 rtx 5070 on pcie3 and 550w psu and works well. u notice pcie only when ur vram is full and tbh when ur vram is full nothing will help . id say get a r5 5600 bcs its the cheapest u can get and will be kind of enough for any mid tier gpu upgrade especially on 1440p . the rest ig ur best bet is a well priced rx 9060xt 16gb ofc then a 5060 . 40 series are kind of rare to find used since they r still new ish. 3080 eats sm power that u will need to get a new psu and tbh dont go 30 series,Neutral
Intel,Pls dont forget iam talking about 2k gaming. 😊,Negative
Intel,Whats the price of a 9060XT 16GB there?,Neutral
Intel,"9060xt 16gb?  If not maybe 7700xt used, 7800XT used, 4070 used, 6700xt used or 6800XT used. Those are some good options that are above 8gb of ram I believe",Positive
Intel,"tough spot to be in, the PSU is holding you back from the better value GPUs like the 3080. Not many GPUs you can actually upgrade to because of the PSU with only 1 8pin(daisy chain doesn't count). I think upgrade the CPU, then when you can upgrade your psu, then get a 3080.",Negative
Intel,I’m running a Ryzen 5 5500 with an RTX 3060 eagle and it’s been pretty much able to handle anything I’ve tried playing. Considering I got the PC pre built for like $700 then replaced the graphics card and slapped in a second SSD it wasn’t too bad.,Positive
Intel,You will benefit a lot in esports titles by getting a secondhand 5600(x) for your CPU!  The thing with newer NVIDIA cards in the 60-tier is that they use x8 lane configuration and therefore PCIe 3.0 will be somewhat of a bottleneck.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KkRibhp7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KkRibhp7A) the 4060 Ti is a very small upgrade over the 3060 Ti in an ideal configuration. I couldn't find a PCIe 3.0 1440p benchmark but the 3060 Ti should be able to perform closer to its max due to its x16 lane configuration.,Positive
Intel,"How much do 6800(xt) 6900xt, 7700xt or 7800xt’s cost? Or a 3070.",Neutral
Intel,Smart guy,Neutral
Intel,"U sure if i get 5060 8gb it will be fine ? Its the cheapest option of them anyway and i like it so much cuz its the newest , if i upgrade to ryzen 5 5600x no problem then?",Positive
Intel,Thanks man that was really helpful 👍  But how u running 5070 on 550 u do power limit? They told me i cant get a 3070ti with my 600w,Neutral
Intel,"144 fps at 2K is insane even if you max out every slot that your motherboard and the cooling system can handle. Without the X3D CPUs, you are nowhere near avg 144 fps. However, consistent 60-75 fps is possible.",Neutral
Intel,420 usd for 8gb 510 usd for 16 gb,Neutral
Intel,"Thats actually a new approach never thought that way , but what will i gain from upgrading cpu now?",Neutral
Intel,"Daisy chaining is normally fine but yes that psu is holding him back from older higher end cards and we don't even know if it's a good 600 or some junk. What I do see is 600 is enough for the 5060 GPU,",Negative
Intel,3060 is just goated bro have fun ♥,Positive
Intel,So what did you decide to get?,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, that's a good combo. It's what I would suggest for a good budget build if your wanting to buy new parts.",Positive
Intel,5070 max power is 250w and my cpu 75w max thats barely 350w and my psu is 82% efficiency which is around 450w so my psu is still chilling . aslong as u have a budget cpu 550 is more than enough,Neutral
Intel,"Iam already there with the 1660 super in fps games , doesnt have to be 144 in AAA games and i can play on medium settings too ,i prefer fps",Neutral
Intel,"and thats why iam very positive with the rtx 5060, because I intend to upgrade MB and CPU later",Positive
Intel,"If 510 works, that could be tempting. What about 5060Ti 16GB? Any other GPUs around that price?",Neutral
Intel,"maybe in more CPU bottlenecked games, but you will not see a large improvement. GPU also holding you back. If possible, maybe do the upgrades altogether, you will see a good improvement that way.   My recommendation is to wait for a price drop/deal for CPU and PSU, then look for the GPU.",Negative
Intel,"Not 100% yet, but it looks like a 9060xt 16gb + upgrade cpu later  Also maybe 5060 ti 16gb",Neutral
Intel,"I teuat u man but u r the first one who say this , everyone else said its a big no and 5060 is a disaster on gen 3, i hope u right though",Negative
Intel,5070 with a small undervolt goes from 250w to 150-170w,Neutral
Intel,"Actually, in FPS games, your prior is the CPU instead of GPU. Due to the nature of those games' engines, you will benefit most for stronger CPU. You just need an average GPU to render competitive settings.",Positive
Intel,"Thats 560, high for me , i mean can get both cpu and gpu upgraded with this",Positive
Intel,"GPU pricese are going up thats why i think this way , thanks a lot 😊",Positive
Intel,Glad your getting 16vram. I have a 3080 that is handy capped by its 10 vram. I demoted it to my living room PC.,Positive
Intel,I'll look into it,Neutral
Intel,Oohh damn the 5060 are 8x buss not 16x so that's weird with pcie 3. Maybe you shouldn't get one for that motherboard I dint know they cheaped out with the buss lanes on them. You need to get a card that's 16x buss lanes for pcie 3 not to be a issue,Negative
Intel,"i dont think i understand that totally but yeah thats what i was told xd , so i just stick with the 4060 ti?",Neutral
Intel,"So think of lanes if traffic, I'm sad to say even 4060ti is 8 lanes too but has much more vram so it'll be less of a issue than the 5060 because your less likely to run out of vram. I saw that you said you do plan on upgrading motherboard? The 5060 runs into issues with 3.0 pcie boards when the vram runs out meaning it needs to overflow into ram more. The 16gig on the 4060ti less likely run out. You can upgrade in steps.",Neutral
Intel,"Mmmmmmm I don't know how to tell you , but iam talking about the 8 GB version of 4060 ti too :D",Positive
Intel,you must have some huge hands judging from the apparent size of that box,Neutral
Intel,"Holy shit my hands look like a giant Hold on ill get you a pic with me actually holding the BOX, not the gpu.  https://preview.redd.it/kkndv19xh1dg1.jpeg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=924d6b75377cecc6a98ac1bae1a765b4349dc025",Negative
Intel,"yes, but choose the b580 instead (though it has 12gb of VRAM), also id recommend the rx 9060xt 16gb",Positive
Intel,Get the B580 in my opinion,Neutral
Intel,Had the a770 LE loved it! Wasn’t very powerful considering the specs but it was nice to see Intel actually putting effort in the Gpu space. I would personally go with the B580,Positive
Intel,Yup. Also does media processing very very good.,Positive
Intel,"CPUs don't support resizable BAR, devices do. Arc cards don't require resizable BAR it's just expected to be used.",Negative
Intel,"Rebar isn't needed for Arc gpus to function, but it is needed for them to function as intended. I believe Arc does need a motherboard with a UEFI bios, but could be wrong on that.",Neutral
Intel,You can look up compatibility on the PC builder site.   I got a Z790 for 125$   I got the I5-14600Kf for 150$   It holds up really nice.  BE REALLY CAREFUL the Intel GPUs need REBAR so keep your eyes peeled for that.,Positive
Intel,"Must be nice to have a MC, my closest is a few thousand miles away.",Positive
Intel,intel 13th and 14th gen have cpu failures so only buy if you are willing to risk that,Neutral
Intel,Totally forgot about the rebar. Thanks for the reminder. My current cpu and mobo support rebar and I have it activated. Definitely something I’ll have to consider when I upgrade to ddr5,Positive
Intel,Would 12600kf for 100 be good?,Positive
Intel,A few thousand miles? Sorry that sucks. Their bundles/combos on parts are better than sex sometimes.,Negative
Intel,I mean.. CPUs are pretty far ahead of GPUs at least in terms of gaming.   Unless you planned on running 1440 with everything on ultra the B580 is great on most games. You’ll never feel like you are forced to run a game on low graphics.,Positive
Intel,If you plan on investing in Intel GPUs I would press you to get the newest gen.   Intel ARC B580 which is an entry Intel GPU didn’t play nice with older Intel Chips   12600 would hold up just fine.,Positive
Intel,Thanks there’s also the brand new core ultra 5 225f with bf6 for 150 on amazon. Would ultra core be a better fit?,Positive
Intel,If you don’t plan on upgrading it’s fine but if Intel releases a newer card that more powerful it might get bottlenecked.,Neutral
Intel,Dang maybe am5 cpu is better,Positive
Intel,I’d say to go AMD.   Intel royally fucked up in that race but since they did have a major price drop because of it I scooped one up cheap.,Neutral
Intel,"I know this may sound a weird, but I would wait six months before doing any additional work to your system.  It looks fine, great even, and hopefully it’s meeting your needs… but it’s worth using it for a few months to help better determine what works, what doesn’t, what you’d like to change, etc.  There’s always a weird period for me after a build where it’s like… “great, now what?”, “what project should I do next?”.  You may be experiencing this.",Positive
Intel,"tyvm for this reply! At this point im not thinking on ""upgrading"" any further. But i do feel that im missing out ""quality"" wise, when it come to the ingame quality.  Let me use ArcRaiders as an example, first time ever running a recent tittle in EPIC quality. but still feels grainy, but im realy not sure if its related to the monitor, (can provide model when i get home), it's connected with DP.  Right now im very much pleased obviously, and hearing that it looks fine, probably the only thing i might be buying is indeed a monitor cuz currently im just using one. and for what i hear you dont buy a second monitor, you buy a better new one and use the current as the 2nd.",Neutral
Intel,"You’d need twice the ram, a way newer cpu for 200fps in anything modern, sure cs, valo and Fortnite will run 400fps on a 7500f or 14600k cpu which cost 130$/190$ respectively with the first being upgradable and the second one being able to use ddr4. But anyways you’d 100% need a new mobo. For 1080p you’d also want at least 12gb of vram for future titles but some shit show games like borderlands 4 or escape from tarkov are just so unoptimized your lucky to get 90fps in those. Normal games like cyberpunk with normal settings or the new battlefield will give you around 150-200fps but it’s tricky in the newer engines to consistently hit high fps with very realistic graphics.   So TLDR: you need to change everything anyways. Currently building is bad due to ram shortages and GPUs went up last week all 50-100$ already due to vram shortages. So get yourself a decent prebuilt. 7800x3d if doable and 5070 or 9070 should be great and doable around 1800$",Neutral
Intel,"The only thing you can save is your ssd, which is tiny and I guess can be used for your system install.",Neutral
Intel,"Great answer, thank you.  Worth it to even try to sell my current rig on marketplace or just keep it as a second setup?",Positive
Intel,"It’s still decently worth something 250$ if it looks good should be fair and gone quite quickly. Maybe a bit more if you have time. If that enables a better purchase I’d be extremely inclined to do it since prices now are high but the prebuilt options I mentioned or the one you said are very capable so you don’t „need“ to get something even better, it’s more of a „if you want it it’s not gonna hurt“ as you can keep the pc longer",Positive
Intel,It'll eat those games for breakfast.,Neutral
Intel,That'll do it. Is that a prebuilt? What's the pricing like?,Neutral
Intel,"It's fine. Folks here glaze all over AMD's x3d CPUs (This house has 4 vs 1 Intel) but if the price is right, the 14600k is going to be fine - especially if you're not looking for screaming fast frame rates.   Intel currently is the better productivity CPU where AMD takes the gaming crown. So if there is an AMD option, with a 9800x3d or 7800x3d and all you're looking to do is game, I'd do that.   And like the Intel CPU can also game well, the AMD x3d CPUs also do productivity well. It's just not where that particular CPU shines.",Positive
Intel,Sweet thank you! I bought a pc yeeeears ago that had a great price but I didn’t look into the specs like an idiot. I can barely play lethal company on it right now 😂,Negative
Intel,Ya it’s a prebuilt for $2300 (before tax),Neutral
Intel,Appreciate it! I’ll remember that!,Positive
Intel,You could likely build an equivalent PC for cheaper. Like $400 cheaper.,Neutral
Intel,"FYI, since you listed the price ($2300)  I just spec'd a system at Microcenter, as an AMD 7800x3d system (Though you can opt for an Intel 14700k for about the same price)  https://www.microcenter.com/site/content/custom-pc-builder-intel.aspx?load=38b8be67-c081-4b28-afeb-6751f62f22e2  Includes a Windows license.  I took the cheapest case for a total of just over $1800.  Pick whatever RGB fishtank nightmare case you want and change the sufficient Phantom Spirit to a 360 LCD Hatsune x Sephiroth edition AIO and if you're not comfortable assembling it yourself, add Microcenter's build it service and you should still be below $2300 for a more powerful machine.",Neutral
Intel,Ya zelyre just mentioned that in the comments too. He specd and built a pc in like 10minutes that was cheaper than what I have been looking at for a couple weeks lol.,Positive
Intel,Cries in ram and ssd,Neutral
Intel,"Oh wow, thank you! See I wouldn’t even know where to begin with specs so I just look at prices and assume it would be a decent enough PC 😂",Positive
Intel,lol old skool,Neutral
Intel,"Personally I think the fps jump is worth it, I prefer higher fps over better looking games, the rtx 2060 will make the games look way better for sure, but you will feel a jump in responsiveness from 144 fps, specially based on the fact that you play cs and Fortnite, since shooters are games that feel the best with high refresh rate.",Positive
Intel,how much does a gpu cost for you? I think 144hz IPS monitor would be much cheaper,Neutral
Intel,Fps doesn't matter if your monitor doesn't show it.  Have your dad buy the more expensive one and you save money for the cheaper one.,Negative
Intel,Monitor would be better value,Positive
Intel,"i think the monitor would be smth like 400PLN (94EUR/$110) and the GPU i could be looking for would be 600-700PLN, but that doesnt matter that much, im just thinking what would be better value, an old gpu with 144hz, which would be useful only in some esport games (bc its too weak to play SP on good settings on >60 frames) or a new gpu with a old 60hz monitor so the extra frames wouldnt change anything",Neutral
Intel,"i told him to buy a monitor cuz its gonna be at least few months till i could buy a gpu, so i could use higher refresh rate meanwhile and the price difference wasnt that bad (600pln for the gpu arc a750 and 400 for 144hz ips monitor)",Neutral
Intel,"yea, i think im gonna buy that for now",Neutral
Intel,"I see that you are from Poland, you can find good deals on monitors here: https://www.pepper.pl/grupa/monitory   And other things like GPU or anything really, Pepper is a neat site, kind of like reddit but you upvote or downvote deals other users find.",Neutral
Intel,"I think monitor would be better, if you already hit 60 fps in SP games you would get no smoothness improvement from a new gpu     gpu should be your next upgrade though",Neutral
Intel,"yea, i was thinking just like you, so im gonna buy a monitor for now (some budget Philips E-Line 24E2N1110/00 for 279pln) and look for some intel arc a750 in the near future, you think its a good idea or i should look for smth else?",Neutral
Intel,"Not sure about budget monitor market tbh, might wanna make a separate post on this (or other) sub, idk if its allowed to ask about this here  include your country btw when asking for recommendations  just look for 144hz ips 27'' or 24'', chinese is fine",Neutral
Intel,Maybe the psu is a little light for the system? If the gpu can draw 225w and 65w for the cpu. That’s already around 300w. With fans and MB added to the wattage it could be too much for the power supply to provide.,Neutral
Intel,Are your graphic drivers up to date?  If so the next thing I would check is your power draw.,Neutral
Intel,change your hdd or ssd,Neutral
Intel,"I set it up so the GPU draws 180w from the PSU, and the PSU is probably not the problem because the game ran smoothly at 100+ FPS on the Legacy version",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah they are, i did a clean install this time wich means every old driver i didnt delete got deleted, still didnt fix it, i think the PSU isnt the problem because GTA online on the legacy version ran at 100+ FPS in high settings",Negative
Intel,No,Neutral
Intel,Why not buy a cheaper gpu?,Neutral
Intel,How would that make anything better ?,Neutral
Intel,You’re not allowing the GPU to run at its full engineered potential (waste of money/starving the GPU of power it needs to run enhanced version). Then complain about graphical issues and studders while using an underpowered PSU. That’s the problem.,Negative
Intel,"Ik my psu is bad i just dont have the money for it, i was looking for temporary fixes",Negative
Intel,When you get a stronger PSU change ALL power supply cables too.  Even the same brand of PSU can be pinned differently and it can potentially fry part/all of your system. At least legacy works good so that’s better than nothing. 😋,Neutral
Intel,mmmm if your Dell doesnt support Resizeable BAR I wouldn't bother with Intel ARC. It's a requirement to get useable performance out of them.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah that was the original intent before it got fried. Pulled the cmos out to see if I can reset the bios and get it moving. Otherwise I’ll try those methods, thanks!",Neutral
Intel,"It’s got resizable bar support, but apparently I did something wrong along the way because this thing boots straight to that by the time my monitor is up and running",Negative
Intel,Which model is it?,Neutral
Intel,"5680, cpu should support it as should the bios if my prior research came up right.",Neutral
Intel,I really dont think a PC from 2018 supports Rebar. I could be wrong though.  Maybe you could try booting with the integrated GPU and go from there.,Negative
Intel,"I tried that option, but the only integrated option was a display port. Wouldn’t have thought that’d be an issue, but my monitor hits me with a “display disabled, reset computer” screen",Negative
Intel,"Update, unplugged the arc and went for the display port. It’s not as fucked but still hardly booting",Neutral
Intel,"Just a FYI resizable base address register has been a thing since PCIe 3.0 was released in 2010.  The real question is if the BIOS has the settings or not.  RebarUEFI can add support for pretty much any UEFI based system but it isn't easy to get working properly. Back when I was looking into using RebarUEFI for an el cheepo system I discovered that AMD's ""Smart access memory"" is based on REBAR but with improvements.",Neutral
Intel,My z370+8600k supports reBAR no problem,Negative
Intel,"I never played arc raiders before, but maybe try turning off ray tracing? There's no way that doesn't tank your fps right?",Negative
Intel,cpu bottleneck,Neutral
Intel,"If you wanna usw raytracing, enable the framegen. If for whatever reason you don’t want to use framegen, disable raytracing   Watch your fps go up.",Neutral
Intel,Run gpu-z. Check your pice gen,Neutral
Intel,Definitely CPU bottlenecked.  70% GPU and only a 5800x.  Makes sense to me.,Neutral
Intel,"Bottleneck for sure, I have a 5070 and with a 1440p monitor i have 260fps",Neutral
Intel,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_aVtaZXabWk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aVtaZXabWk)  this guy uses my same cpu and a 5080, he has 150 fps and i have less than half of them, i cant believe that between a 5070 and a 5080 there is a more than 70 fps difference",Neutral
Intel,69% is not bottleneck man,Neutral
Intel,There’s no way that the 5800x is the bottleneck right? Is Raiders that heavily CPU bound?,Neutral
Intel,"In order to evaluate CPU bottleneck you need to look up CPU usage as well, 5800X has 31% capacity usable, the problem is elsewhere.",Neutral
Intel,is it same settings?,Neutral
Intel,The 5080 is a much better card so yeah it could be 70 fps. I've not watched the video but is he using DLAA? It's pretty heavy although probably worth it. With my 4070ti at 4K DLSS Performance (so 1080 internally) I hit my frame cap of 117 fps with 85% GPU usage in the lobby with these settings.  https://preview.redd.it/ly7s9l0ensdg1.png?width=1823&format=png&auto=webp&s=05620f09de69b0849ab3c0b653ca9aa6111b04ec  Cinematic is higher than Epic but you need to edit the config file to set it so just use Epic in it's place. IIRC Global Illumination was the most resource intensive setting.  I loaded up the Firing Range and I get 108 fps stood right in front of the dummy with white arrows pointing to it's face at 99% GPU usage. Running up and down that road I get from 102 to 115 fps.,Neutral
Intel,"knowing my friend runs into bottlenecks with overclocked 5600 and 9060xt, it pretty well might be",Positive
Intel,"AM4 cpus are just trash man, for some reason they are becoming popular again because of DDR5 prices, but the fact remains that for modern 50 series gpus they are like metal ball chain on your leg. even the mighty 5800x3d that is the fastest gaming AM4 cpu and just 3-4 years ago it was the king, is now few percent slower than ryzen 7500F. Ryzen 7500F is an entry level AM5 ryzen cpu for $130 (yet 5080X3D somehow resells for $500-600). I have ryzen 7500F myself, i even heavily overclocked it to 7600X level, and i am still considering getting 9800x3D, because i am beating cpu bottlenecked suprisingly often on my 5070Ti. Any non-X3D AM4 cpu is complete trash for modern games.",Negative
Intel,70% CPU usage means you are CPU bottlenecked because you play at 1080p and you can't do nothing about it until you drop settings or increase resolution or use DLSSQ or buy new CPU!,Neutral
Intel,Damn that’s fucking crazy.,Negative
Intel,Damn I had no idea. I know people who still use 9 and 10 series intel for gaming. Had no idea that era of AM4 was so low preforming. I thought AMD learned their lesson on 8 core duds after FX.,Negative
Intel,"I know what a bottle neck looks like, I’m just floored that arc raiders is cpu bound enough to cause a bottleneck in such a new cpu. I’d expect that from a 3600 not a 5800x. That’s barely 5 years old.",Negative
Intel,I also have a 5070Ti and play at 4K which is heavily GPU dependant but at that resolution AM4 X3D is perfectly fine still. Far from bottlenecking me since every game is 100% GPU usage. Even at 1440p I don’t think it would be an issue. At least in BF6 it’s not.,Positive
Intel,Tbh 5800x ain't that fast nowadays so more settings you put on GPU then more you put on CPU when you play at 1080p,Negative
Intel,"you just dont play cpu demanding games, even 5800x3d  can bottleneck you in 4K fps gameplay, for example in Kingdom Come 2 whenever there is a big siege or battle, my fps tends to drop to 50fps, 40 fps, sometimes even below 40, due to my ryzen 7500F being way too slow (but still faster than 5800x3D). I recognize cpu bottleneck by gpu utilization dropping below 80% and cpu utilization is very high, typically over 70% but in KCD2 even 95-100% utilization isnt rare. The cpu busy time is higher than gpu busy, indicating that cpu takes a longer time to produce each frame. Other cpu demanding games are Starfield, Star citizen, Microsoft flight simulator, total war series or any strategy with thousands of units, stalker 2, battlefield 6, sometimes elden ring, your cpu would be struggling in all those games (and many more)",Negative
Intel,I mean it’s basically a two intel 7700k’s stapled to together. You’d think that would be more than enough.,Neutral

Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.

I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.

The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.

Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Neutral

Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral

Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.

Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,Lunar lake came out after strix point. It was squarely a competitor to the 890m. Amd just officially released the cut down strix point as Z2E later.,Neutral
Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

Intel,"Yeah, and AMD says Strix Halo has four channels in their customer facing spec as well, because they have 128b and 256b buses respectively. They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

Panther Lake's cpu is built on the most advanced silicon process node 18A, designed to compete against TSMC's N2 (2nm) which is set to release in products in the second half of 2026. Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Intel,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",Neutral

I don't use a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but the maximum operating temperature (Tjmax) for the 7800X3D is 89°C. If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.  Based on my experience, CPU temps over 100 °C usually indicate poor thermal management or inadequate cooling.",Neutral

You can get the expo sticks, but the only thing that'd really change for you is the preprogrammed profile to allow you to get it with just a single setting.

Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.

That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Main impact is on pcie bandwidth as it'll use up quite a lot there, and to a smaller degree RAM load, so you definitely don't want to run some other dynamic load on the igpu when gaming to overwhelm its pcie link.

For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative

Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Neutral
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Negative
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.

Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Neutral
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Negative
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral
Intel,"> One year already...Cyberpunk 2077 not fixed yet.  On year, I did not know.  I was thinking of a 9070XT earlier in spring, but choose... differently",Negative
Intel,welcome to amd,Neutral
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Negative
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.

Intel,"Not a problem on Linux with Wayland. Ever.   Main reason I ditched Windows 11, constant screen tearing and input lag made me go crazy.",Negative
Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative

Intel,Epic version runs just fine.,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative
Intel,It's most likely the same as I've described here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/)  But yeah unfortunately seems like all you can do for now is either roll back to 25.10.2 or disable your iGPU if you don't use it,Negative
Intel,probably because those issues are build specific.  I've not had any freezing or locks on any drivers this whole year.,Neutral
Intel,"The game is booting, this message was for the 25.10 they just didn't removed it",Negative
Intel,I don't know your system specifications but in many cases setting the BIOS to PCIe v4 could help.     Try change in your bios,Neutral

Intel,Do u reintall already up to date chipset drivers?,Neutral
Intel,You should use the Factory Reset installation in the AMD Driver Installer so it removes the newest AMD Adrenalin and install back the correct Adrenalin driver.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't have a DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 adapter to try, sorry.",Negative
Intel,doing so (separation) will create a freak out shitstorm part 2.,Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral
Intel,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
Intel,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
Intel,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
Intel,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.   Didn't matter how I tried to access the software. Wasn't active in the system tray, not there in task manager.   Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
Intel,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
Intel,"I had randomly black screens with 24.2.1, this was annoying as hell. Had to DDU the Driver and went back to 23.11.1, after this everything was fine.",Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
Intel,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
Intel,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Positive
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
Intel,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
Intel,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral
Intel,Can you provide me some context? Are there any posts detailing the issue either here or at the chromium project side?,Neutral
Intel,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral

Intel,Some of us are using DP 2.1 though. DP 1.4 is a thing of the past.,Neutral
Intel,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Negative
Intel,With the compiled leaked DLL you can use it on RDNA3 as well.,Neutral
Intel,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Negative
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Neutral
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative
Intel,"I see, btw I'm just telling the natural AMD trends on its major update/features on its GPU (kinda). Wish it coming sooner..",Neutral
Intel,lmao chill out dude go touch some grass,Neutral
Intel,Could be grounds for lawsuit… That’s funny!,Neutral
Intel,Because of MPO.,Neutral
Intel,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
Intel,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Neutral
Intel,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
Intel,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral

Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option.

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers.

Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative

Intel,Gotta remember that it's Intel's first line of GPUs. It's going to have issues ofc. Even now they're still improving. And it's only going to keep getting better from here on out,Positive
Intel,"Ok mate, take a first gen product and compare it to a 7th or 8th gen product.  Intel has their issues, anyone buying into them should have known that.",Negative
Intel,"You probably setup VRR wrong, whether that wasnt enabling V-Sync (yes, youre supposed to for VRR), or you tried to use an older HDMI standard, or had a bad driver install and didnt clean install new drivers. Because it absolutely does work as intended with Arc. Arc's VRR is based on VESA's adaptive sync, like Freesync and G-sync compatible also are.  As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers. Just like a 7900XTX would make your 6800 XT look like its junk.",Negative

Intel,bruh. This is Intel first generation of discrete GPU. it's damn impressive how fast they are improving. I like AMD too but Intel is doing a pretty good job there,Positive
Intel,I had an arc a750 as a placeholder until I got. A 6950xt and I love it so much. Except amd still hasn't fixed the ghost of tsushima issue other than that it's been phenomenal and I get over 60fps in almost every game at 4k,Positive
Intel,"Well one great thing you have to look forward to is amd is going all in on software. They already said FSR with AI is coming, and I have a feeling a lot more. We should be seeing some pretty cool software features coming out now that they have more employees for software",Positive
Intel,"Actually not. Intel i740, released long time ago was the first discrete GPU from them.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm keeping my eye on Intel gpus, but I certainly won't be a first adopter. Honestly I'll be even more skeptical now with Intel's recent issues with 13/14 gen cpus. All in all though more competition is always good for us consumers. If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Neutral
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative
Intel,If you're playing ghost of tsushima with her enabled it will crash your drivers and you'd have to re-download them via integrated graphics on your cpu,Negative
Intel,"It's not completely irrelevant, as it shows they already had GPU produced before. That GPU had driver issues same as ARC and i believe same will be passed on to BATTLE MAGE.",Neutral
Intel,"Dude, GPU is not same as graphics card. i740 was a GPU in a same way nVidia RTX and AMD RX series are today.  You are mixing them up because todays graphics cards have names same as the GPU used on them.

Intel,Graphics Processing Unit.  Maybe you're confused and thinking of GPGPU?,Neutral
Intel,"her?   i cant say i encountered any problems other than launching with FSR activated crashed the game, but it was optimized enough that you dont need FSR at all (also a ps4 game port which helps)",Neutral
Intel,It's irrelevant because it's from so long ago the people who worked on it are likely no longer working at Intel so there's no organizational knowledge to transfer into designing Arc.,Negative
Intel,Not irrelevant though is that Intel has been making iGPU drivers for the last 20+ years with massive marketshare and still don't get it anywhere NEAR right.,Negative

Intel,Honestly the Nvidia Founders edition in person is the best looking card I've ever seen.,Positive
Intel,"I bought an ARC A770 16GB card for experimentation and my experience seems to have been better than computerbase.  I had no problem using it for 3440x1440 without raytracing. I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Neutral
Intel,I have a budget build for my vacations off grid with arc a380 heavy oc pushing 2750mhz. Works amazing for 1080p e sport titles and some heavy games low settings around 50-60fps.. off no ray tracing lol.,Positive

Intel,Something about that sexy look of my GTX 1080 fe is gonna make it very hard to replace it.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, i like the black super series.",Positive
Intel,"But that's not because your GPU has 20gb vram, that's because AMD doesn't perform well in RT and especially not in PT I promise you a 16gb 4080 will run circles around your 7900xt with PT.  And no I'm not an Nvidia chill I have a 7900xtx myself",Negative
Intel,"people have more information more easily available now, so they know what a good price is for a gpu.   Yeah, you can't a good deal on older cards just because they're old, but you can get more money for your old cards yourself when you wanna upgrade.",Neutral
Intel,I think this needs more mainstream coverage - someone like Wendell@Level1Techs should be interested in this and related phenomena.,Neutral
Intel,"Same experience when using AMDGPU on Linux. Hardware rings will reset after timeout, but you have no guarantee that functionality will return to normal after the reset.

Intel,">listen to them and fix the bugs they report  AMD have been dropping the ball on this for decades, and aren't about to pick it up any time soon.

Intel,"They couldn't care less. We've had issues with AMD drivers in a video production house where we ran Vega GPUs under Linux for DaVinci Resolve editing on the desktops and for rendering on the farm.   Those were the worst years of my life where I had to support the investment that failed as soon as the decision to go with AMD was made.   It costed our company the weight of those cards in solid gold.   After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware. Thousands of editors, graders and admins go on forums and ask about AMD only to just get directed to Nvidia by the BlackMagic staff.  Great job AMD! You don't deserve a single customer...",Negative
Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative
Intel,"Yo, I saw the title and thought this gotta be Gnif2.",Neutral
Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.  They working with some kind of magic radiation over there?",Negative
Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral
Intel,"I promise you the Vanguard program will yield nothing. ""*AMD Radeon*™ *Software Vanguard* Beta Testers are selected community members with exclusive access to early drivers to provide critical feedback.""

Intel,"[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.  Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.  Speaking of which users started reporting flickering issues in browsers such as chrome, or any chrome based browsers, and their 2 reports of it being fixed after MPO is disabled so i guess MPO issues are back on the menu.  [Also i would love to see AMD Gaming YouTube channel to play and livestream Horizon Zero Dawn with HDR turned on in game using AMD relive ](https://i.imgur.com/1RtZtsi.mp4)  Their also way more issues then i just mentioned i have like 41 commonly reported issues from reddit and forums that not been fixed in 24.3.1 and its still going up, some of my own reported issues as well.  I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.  I think developers and studios etc all should work together, instead of trying to sabotage each other for the sake of monopoly i am looking right at you NVIDIA just stop.",Negative

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

Intel,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",Neutral

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable.

As for Nova, we'll see how it goes, but it's likely a multi-year endeavour, just like it was many years ago for the Amd open drivers.  Currently, from a consumer and Linux user point of view Nvidia should be avoided whenever that's possible, and I speak from experience since I made the mistake of buying a laptop with hybrid graphics and Nvidia gpu. It was a good deal, but that has cost me *a lot* of hours of troubleshooting of different issues, that never happened with AMD or Intel.   The strange thing about Amd is that they focused a lot, in the past few years, on consumer drivers/software, while from the hardware pov they pushed the accelerator on HPC/AI hardware, so there is some kind of mismatch and often their product either have great hardware or great software, but usually not both.",Negative

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral
Intel,"The fact that it can even compare to AMDs halo product, which the avg consumer can’t afford is a win for Intel. Intel has plenty on leg room to expand the GPU too.",Positive

Intel,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

Intel,"We’re talking mobile chipsets here, strix halo is what happens when you throw efficiency out the window, with Power (TDP) range, typically from 55W up to 120W. The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

Intel,"> (more than) half the price  Have we seen pricing? Not doubting it, I just haven't seen anything personally but probably missed it.  Strix Halo does seem to be a pretty mythical chip due to its price.",Neutral
Intel,Keep in mind that each Xe3 core is about as wide as an AMD WGP. We're looking at 1536 vs 2560 shaders. The B390 is 60% as wide as the 8060S. 20 Xe3 cores would match the 8060S in width. 40x Xe3 is as wide as the 7900GRE.,Neutral
Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral
Intel,It's about 50% bigger die with 1 CCD (which seems comparable CPU performance),Neutral
Intel,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative
Intel,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
Intel,"No official confirmation yet, but JayKihn leaked the tile size for the 12Xe SKU last year. Another user somewhere else said the 4Xe GPU is 33mm2.   https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260   And even without the PHYs and NPU, from what I see, Halo's GPU tile is still like almost 3 times as big.

Wildcat lake with its tiny 2Xe GPU is probably going directly into the budget sector.",Neutral

Intel,AMD is dormant on the APU space since it had basically the monopoly for x86 because Intel was just bad.  They are taking one of the old Intel's book by releasing rebrands and reashes,Negative
Intel,"> But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot  By what? much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  We have nothing to compare against in Intel-iGPU-land that has 256bit memory.

It's only 2x the fps (and who knows, panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus, but we'll never know, because Intel won't release a strix halo competitor)",Neutral
Intel,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral
Intel,AMD is paying more attention to NVIDIA for sure. ESP on the data center side.,Neutral
Intel,">much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  The biggest one for the moment is on Panther Lake X CPUs.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
Intel,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.   That said, I have no idea how close the iGPU is to being bandwidth bottlenecked at 1080p. But I very much doubt doubling it would also double the frame rate.",Negative

Intel,"I wonder if Valve would be considering Panther Lake for a Steam Deck 2. It sounds like a generational leap from RDNA2 (which is what they were looking for), and can be cheap enough for valve to slightly subsidize the cost.   I guess the main thing is the power envelope. I think Valve is only interested in making handhelds that deal with a 15W TDP or lower",Neutral
Intel,"the handhelds with these chips are going to slap.

There's also already laptops listed on sites like Best Buy for reasonable prices (sub $1300).

Intel,It's hilarious to think Steam would work with Qualcomm.,Neutral
Intel,"Very unlikely. Proton and DXVK work alright with x86 but adding ARM conversion on top is, uh, a **very** poor experience. In fact that first generation of Snapdragon laptops had among the highest return rate of laptops I have ever seen. Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances. Anything that can increase incompatibility rate (and it VERY well can, ARM **does not** support AVX2 natively for instance meaning [a lot of games that might have issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1dekmtz/avx2_game_list/) even starting or underperform).",Negative

Intel,"Even more efficiency that doesn't exist yet. Snapdragon elite can do some heavy workloads for several hours at a time, but it's not powerful enough for heavy gaming. Valve says they know what they want, it's just not ready yet. I think as great as Panther Lake benchmarks are, the biggest complaint of the Steam Deck is still the 2ish hours of battery life in more demanding titles.  With the existence of other handhelds already, I don't think Valve is trying to aim for the beefier spec department here, if it means the same battery life.",Negative

Intel,"That's a bit of a different case, because they are designing a new product either way they might as well look into supporting something like LPCAMM2. They already have a mainboard for the FW13 that can support these newer CPUs, so there has to be a very compelling reason to spend money to redesign that, which I think a single Intel SKU is not unfortunately.",Negative
Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.  But you won't see DDR5 SO-DIMM designs - if they claim to be DDR5 SO-DIMM and Arc B390 then its wrong.",Neutral
Intel,"It certainly sounds like we will get dedicated NVL-H, and that's what the rumors claim as well.

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

Intel,"If Intel is really about to release a B770, honestly the **only thing that could make it competitive is the price**. (FOR ME, competitive in 2026 means <400€) From a performance standpoint, it would need to undercut existing GPUs quite aggressively to make sense, especially given how crowded the mid-range already is.  That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"are people high or something? intel was losing money on optane and their SSD business became irrelevant the minute regular memory manufacturers slammed the market. don't get me wrong, they were some of the most durable on the market, but they were no where near printing money on the memory business.  optane may have survived if their nodes were on schedule, keeping CXL support on schedule, but not because it was profitable.",Negative

Intel,"I feel like the price has to be more than competitive. If they can undercut competition cards of the same performance by 100 or so (or maybe offer rebates or freebies) they could potentially steal the market in that category.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

AMD,The main benefit is simplification of running software. You'd no longer desire to choose which CCD to pin a program to for the best experience and can just let a program use both.,Positive
AMD,It's to make the specs sheet look beefier. Actual power draw and efficiency should be virtually identical to the 9950X3D. If you increase the PPT manually to 250W on the 9950X3D you'd get similar results in everything apart from heavy cache-sensitive computing workloads.,Neutral

The 8700K test shows that for CPU loads, the 7700K scored 84.0% while the 6700K was at 77.2%, that's a 9% improvement, the 8700K showed a 19% improvement over the 7700K.

AMD,I am more interested in next gen desktop APUs,Neutral
AMD,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
AMD,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
AMD,"They've basically maxed out the 128-bit normal socket iGPU now.  For them to beat it they need more memory bandwidth - they can put in a bit more cache, but realistically they'll need a quad channel bus (or maybe they can wait for LPDDR6 at 14.4+).  They can probably have a bit more physical room in the next generation of sockets, but without more bandwidth it isn't *that* useful.",Neutral
AMD,"the 140v also got a 25% speed boost post launch, if something similar happens than this could be as good as a 5060 mobile... which is wild! I hope it dosen't cost as much as halo strix!",Positive
AMD,Needs a conroe vs fx62 moment. It doesn't look promising.,Negative
AMD,Why aren't they comparing the AMD 8060S in the current Strix Halo flagship to the Intel B390? Probably because it doesn't go intel's way... interesting.,Neutral
AMD,And yet maybe 5% of customers will buy this version because its absolutely irrelevant for them whether their laptop would have an Iris iGPU from 2014 or a 2500watt RTX 5090.,Negative
AMD,"Thats great. If you are nvidia making dedicated gpu, then better make something that is not shit. 4050 is a joke",Positive
AMD,"But how much does it cost? It mentions it having 16 cores so I'm guessing it's going to be overpriced if you don't need CPU performance, just like Strix Halo.",Negative
AMD,They need a 25% IPC increase to get back to the leading edge in CPU and honestly i don't see it with their current architecture. They need a new radical design   Edit: getting downvoted for what?. Currently Apple and QC have a very solid lead. Even ARM beats Intel and AMD in general CPU workloads and Intel/AMD have been very slow to update their uarch focusing on clock speed over efficiency and IPC,Negative
AMD,"AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 388 just dropped cheaper than the 395 with the same GPU, it will be cheaper than the panther lake.",Positive
AMD,"Depends on Intel's & amd power targets. I dont think its rly feesible for them to target cpu + gpu power usage, 100W combined at least?",Neutral
AMD,then we wouldnt have the 50 gpus anymore. The XX30 and XX40 GPUs died because of iGPUs competing with them.,Negative
AMD,> Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.   So basically every decent APU ever made. Too expensive to the point it bumps into dGPU territory and not powerful enough to be a direct replacement.,Negative
AMD,> Strix halo is a commercial failure. Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.  >  >   Story of AMD APUs.,Negative
AMD,"AMD aimed Strix Halo at AI users first and foremost, thinking those folks would pay the high premiums.   But of course anybody serious about AI would have an Nvidia GPU, and so many other AI users are still just using cloud-based services anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD has always had lower supply compared to Intel and yet AMD client continues to grow. Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel. Strix Halo is still continuing to have designs made, it wouldn't be a 'failure' if we are still getting Strix Halo products at CES...  I wrote a [comment in a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1q7d67m/comment/nyhh23c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the reality of the state of Intel and AMD in the mobile segment. Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
AMD,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
AMD,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
AMD,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
AMD,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
AMD,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
AMD,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
AMD,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
AMD,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
AMD,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
AMD,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral
AMD,I actually think they meant to say Strix Point in the headline there.,Neutral
AMD,"[HP ZBook Ultra G1a 14](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-ZBook-Ultra-G1a-14-review-Powerful-MacBook-Pro-alternative-for-work-and-game.994758.0.html) would've been a better test  Load average: 83.3W   Cyberpunk 2077 ultra \* 110.9W = 80.7fps  Baldur's gate 3: 99.4fps   B390 wattage?   If pantherlake is designed for battery, is it better if it loses performance?",Neutral
AMD,So how many sub 1000 dollar laptops we have with Strix Halo?,Neutral
AMD,It's definitely going to come down to pricing and availability,Neutral
AMD,The new MSI Prestige 16 looks nice.  They all seem to lack Thunderbolt 5 though.,Positive
AMD,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option. LTT’s video on it said Dell is quoting 27 hours of battery life in “general tasks” and 40 hours of video playback. Obviously remains to be seen how real those manufacturers claims are, but here’s hoping.",Neutral
AMD,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
AMD,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
AMD,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
AMD,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral
AMD,"I really don't think that is so important for mobile devices though.  All Intel needs to do is be ""good enough"" and the OEMs will use them in flagship models.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt anybody is going unseat Apple from the ST throne in the near future.,Neutral
AMD,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
AMD,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
AMD,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
AMD,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
AMD,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
AMD,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
AMD,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
AMD,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Negative
AMD,"""Local LLM"" is such an incredibly niche thing I can't believe the tech nerd internet is so obsessed over it. Any real life business use case of AI is cloud based no question asked.",Neutral
AMD,well said,Positive
AMD,Too much listening to MLiD who has a boner for APUs,Negative
AMD,"Idk one can easily flip your statement. Panther lake coming in **2026** competing against continuing discounted 4050s prob less than 4060s. I don't dislike Panther Lake nor am I defending Strix Halo, but I wouldn't say your argument is a rather good one.",Neutral
AMD,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoiWv9BF7Q   It's already at least on par for reasonable power profiles unless you play stuck to the wall.,Neutral
AMD,"Huge step forward, I just wish the didn’t struggle with older and brand new games. It’s a great card if you are willing to do troubleshooting and know computers but I won’t recommend them to family yet.",Positive
AMD,I hope they start supporting dx11 stuff. That’s a ton of games.,Positive
AMD,Isn't TSMC planning to increase pricing on n2 by 20-30%,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Neutral
AMD,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
AMD,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same. So it also pulls 60W on battery.  Unless the manufacturer actually configured the device to simultaneously pull energy from the cord and battery under full load.",Neutral
AMD,About as much as we have PTL laptops,Neutral
AMD,"TB5 isn't a big deal, although I don't like that they have a numpad keyboard, and usually MSI speakers are terrible.",Negative
AMD,But can't you get a laptop with a 5060-5070 at that price?,Neutral
AMD,"Damn, that's really good! it's pretty much macbook air pricing.",Positive
AMD,"> I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  I have a Strix Halo.  What you wrote is exactly what it is.  It's essentially a 9950x (so all P-cores) with a fat iGPU attached, and with a 4 channel memory controller instead of 2-channel.",Neutral
AMD,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
AMD,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
AMD,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral
AMD,Single Core is very important when Intel is doing these designs that lack P cores throughout. The cheapest X2 Elite has the same amount of P cores as the most expensive Panther Lake SKU,Neutral
AMD,"Qualcomm is already super close with Oryon V3...  Perf/Watt for that single thread isn't close I guess, but absolute performance is breathing down Apple's neck for sure.  Also, don't compare Geekbench scores on windows vs Linux/Apple/Android... Windows just does something negatively about it and the difference is 5-7% vs non-windows.",Neutral
AMD,>Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens.  I would be shocked if this has much to do with a large performance uplift. I imagine it would have to do more with rightsizing core area and power draw.,Negative
AMD,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
AMD,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
AMD,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
AMD,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral
AMD,"What is possible? PS5 uses GDDR6 instead of DRAM. And consoles are heavily subsidized by digital purchases. I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative
AMD,Even their Ryzen 5 AI 340 laptop are too expensive and you can buy an older gen Ryzen 5 with Nvidia GPU laptop for same price or even lower with much better GPU performance.,Negative
AMD,"To be frank, high end mobile gaming is also pretty niche.   There are edge cases for AI.   However, the pricing for strix halo was just awkward. At the price levels their SKUs were coming, you might as well go with a nice M4 max and call it a day.",Negative
AMD,Local AI (not just LLM) is universal on mobile and getting to be universal in corporate computers. You just dont see it. The background blurring in Teams meeting? 5x more battery efficient with AI. But its just going to be integrated into Teams and fire up if hardware supported without asking you.  >Any real life business use case of AI is cloud based no question asked.

AMD,"140T (Arrow Lake) isn't the same as 140v (Lunar Lake) though, the former is usually quite a bit weaker and inconsistent in games despite slaying all the synthetics.",Neutral
AMD,"It is probably because the AIO was one of their most, if not the most recent RTX 4050 tested (March 17th 2025) which probably enabled them to compare in newer title like F1 25 in the article, as it has already been around for like 3 years while RTX 5050 was released last year and received more attention in its place overall. From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

AMD,"QC last year had a bad product.  It was competitive vs AMD and Intel but Qc was selling those for 50% less than Intel or AMD chips. OEMs at first decided to price these at Intel prices then it settled at Intel -100/200€   QC laptops still sold what QC and partners expected and OEMs are increasing new models for X2 (design wins went from 60 to 100+)   X2 has a 25% advantage vs Panther Lake and it will still be cheaper because QC is an underdog. If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029. The laptop market is VERY slow to move. AMD had a better product for several generations and it only netted them +10%   While QC and Mediatek/Nvidia don't hit a bigger marketshare number.

To be clear, I'm not saying it's some sort of conspiracy or whatever, I don't know much about Taiwan's economic situation or cultural situation at that time, maybe it made sense for a lot of Taiwanese to go to the US for better prospects. But how do all those coincidences happen out of random chance, stack up all those things and the chances are surely very low?

AMD,"Atually, after the backlash for trying drop support on RDNA 1 and 2 they write this:  >**Why We’re Doing This**  >Our goal is simple: to give every Radeon gamer the best experience possible.  By separating the code paths, our engineers can move faster with new features for RDNA 3 and RDNA 4, while keeping RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 stable and optimized for current and future games.     When was the last time RDNA 3 received a new feature?",Neutral
AMD,"What misinformation? The fact that my 7900 XTX can use FSR4 FP8 in Linux, and that this possibility was found about 10 months ago and AMD still keeps totally silent about it? And the fact that they actually have a working INT8 FSR4 model that works on older cards but do not release it?  Even people with older cards like the 6800 XT are using INT8 at the quality preset at this point, because of the much better AA and still get slight better FPS than native, and if they go to the performance preset, they still get pretty decent image quality.  Maybe software lock was not the right way to say it, but they are keeping features from older cards and that is a fact.",Neutral
AMD,Disingenuous,Neutral
AMD,"Probably amfm2 in the summer of 2024, the driver based frame gen.",Neutral
AMD,"This isn't a ""fact"". FSR4 is working poorly on your card and you know it. RDNA2 and 3 simply don't have the hardware capable of what FSR4 is trying to do. That's not your card's fault, it's not FSR4's fault, it's not AMD's fault, it's not your fault, it's not *anyone's* ""fault"".  But AMD trying to advertise a feature that barely works would *absolutely* be their fault, and the internet would never be able to stop making awful jokes about it. They clearly did the right thing here.",Negative
AMD,fake graph creation for amd's marketing lie graphs is not a consumer feature though.,Negative
AMD,"Yup, October 2024, meanwhile RTX 3000 and 4000 received DLSS 4 Transformer Models, and also DLSS 4.5, not to mention they already have the ""Redstone features"".  DLSS 4.5 is also more taxing, especially on older cards, but I do not see anybody mad at that, they can use what they want, they can choose between an upscaler with better visuals or a faster upscaler. Choice that RDNA3 does not have (officially).  The official release of INT8 FSR4 would just give the card owners the possibility to choose, if they do not like INT8 FSR4 they can just keep playing with TAA, FSR3, or XeSS.",Neutral
AMD,"Jesus man, I do not understand why people still go with this argument, arguing against what the actual owners of the card say. There is not a single game where I am able to test INT8 FSR4 and decide not to use it, just the lack of shimmering is already a great visual upgrade.     Is it slightly worse than FP8? Yes. Does it run slower than FP8 + RDNA4? Yes. But it is still miles better than any supported AA option RDNA3 has at the moment and it still runs faster than native, so what is the drawback? None. AMD does not release the INT8 model because they do not want to, it only took a single person to compile the binary.     They could just release it as unsupported, beta or preview, whatever, like they did with the AMD GPU Profile Manager to make people use FSR4 in FSR 3.1 games, they just don't want to, and that is a fact.",Negative

AMD,With better  Zen 3 cpus availability comes greater demand for memory necessary to build new AM4 platforms. Higher demand = higher DDR4 prices.,Positive
AMD,"Its a 6 years old generation, yes its great for certain scenarios depending on what you already own, or if you can get all parts new for a very low price (not that likely). I hope people aren't buying it just on desperation and FOMO and not taking newer platforms into account. If its a good deal for the performance, then good.

AMD,I think a decent chunk of people are sitting on a system that already has the amount of DDR4 RAM they want but isn't maxed out on CPU power for what Zen 3 can offer.  Tossing something like a 5700/5800X3D into your existing system looks fairly attractive at present for that sort of user if they can bring those back at a reasonable price point. (and those still sell on Ebay *used* for more than their last retail price).  I don't know that there's going to be a ton of people looking to do a full new build AM4 system at this point if they don't already have RAM for it.,Neutral
AMD,"For better or worse, there are plenty of fast DDR4 in the used market, and CXMT has been making DDR4 for a while now and is a source of DDR4 modules that will at least fulfill demand in China, and thus alleviating demand elsewhere even if they don't make it out.  On top of makers now stopping to retire their DDR4 lines due to the shortage, I think that it would at least be better than DDR5.",Positive

AMD,A lot of used DDR4 knocking about on the secondary market. I personally have 64GB of the stuff and have no interest in moving to DDR5 with current pricing.,Neutral
AMD,One that conveys a massive disappointment and fear for the future of hardware.,Negative
AMD,"AMD would need to redesign the memory controller to be compatible with DDR4 and motherboard makers would have to make DDR4 AM5 motherboards. Easy, technically speaking. But then that redesign, tape-out, validation, etc. all takes time and costs lots of money. DDR4 can cost just as much as DDR5 and it doesn't seem like DDR4 supply will go anywhere but down, so this effort would only make sense for the budget-oriented people reusing the RAM they already own. And while the RAM situation is horrible, it's not going to last forever. It may take several years for the situation to ease if things continue the way they are. Or the bubble may pop next week and take memory prices down with it.  So the biggest consideration is money and whether AMD thinks it's worthwhile to spend it chasing a pretty small market that may no longer exist by the time product is available.",Neutral
AMD,"Would make more sense to go the other way around, design new I/O die and then put Zen5 on AM4. The way you said would need new chipset, new motherboards and a new I/O die. Putting it on AM4, in theory all you would need is a new I/O die. You'd still be stuck with DDR4 and PCIe Gen4 and the other platform limitations on AM4/x570/b550/etc, but that's the tradeoff there.",Neutral

We're in a small window where it's actually a good time to upgrade if you live near a Microcenter.",Neutral
AMD,"But that's more due to lack of demand and retailers happy to let their stored inventory dwindle as they predict demand will only further reduce. If people actually start buying it again it'll shoot up as new supply would be near nonexistant.  This is more for the last people who are still sitting on an earlier ddr4-based chip (or platform in the Intel case) to reuse that memory and give up on waiting for an entire platform refresh to ddr5.  I'm more surprised they're thinking of this for what is pretty much the x3d boost - as there's still plenty of stock of zen3 parts lacking that, and those prices haven't increased *that* much to suggest they're nearly out of stock.",Negative
AMD,"You can get those for $40 on eBay probably. And they can't even fire up the old factories for that cost. If they said Zen 3, so I'd hope it actually will be.",Neutral

AMD,"Regular Zen3 is still great for gaming, it just gets overshadowed by X3D (for good reason). Hardware Unboxed recently did a comparison of several different Zen3 CPU's.  Also keep in mind many CPU gaming benchmarks are done at 1080p or even 720p with something like a 4090. In reality, for a budget DDR4 build you're more likely to use a much lower tier GPU, while running games at 1440p (1440p monitors are nearly the same price as 1080p these days) so the difference won't be as exaggerated.",Positive
AMD,"That's not a 'big' step up.  That's a pretty mild step up.    Most people dont upgrade their CPU every new generation, and that's basically all this is effectively.  The only real consolation here is that Zen 3 CPU's pass muster in modern games better than Zen 2 CPU's do.  So for that I can understand it, but you're only doing it to get over a line, not because it's actually a big improvement.",Negative
AMD,The irony of AMD's best AM4 gaming CPUs having a single CCD is so thick you could cut it with a knife.,Positive

AMD,How are your USB ports and wifi/bluetooth?,Neutral
AMD,"First gen was flaky for a number of reasons.  Another is that many people who bought boards for Zen 1 were shit out of luck if they wanted to upgrade to Zen 3.  Zen 1 was also fairly lackluster in terms of single thread performance, and main selling point was really just being able to have a 6 or 8 core CPU at a more affordable overall price point.  Which was great dont get me wrong, but Intel CPU's were still pretty clearly faster in almost all cases at the time for gaming.  Zen 2 was AM4's real arrival in my opinion, helped a lot by Intel stumbling off a cliff at the time.  But if you got in with Zen 2, then your upgrade path was ok, but it wasn't half as miraculous as people make it out to be unless you went for Zen 3 Vcache parts specifically.    AM4 was definitely good and worthwhile, but there's certainly a bit of overselling the narrative here.",Negative

AMD,am confused. this is battlemage too right? because its a B series. but its supposed to be all new. and the old gen was battlemage too on the 200V series. so what is going on here?. is this just a bigger GPU or is this Xe3 so that would be Celestial.,Neutral

AMD,"Even if that claim were overstated by 2x, would still be a colossal L for amd.",Negative
AMD,Xps is a huge seller for Dell and they are straight up using Panther Lake and XE3. They are exclusively going intel. Intel is 100% securing up there dominance in Labtops. In the process also taking business away from Nvidia.,Positive
AMD,I hesitate to trust Intel's charts. But I am interested if Intel will actually get companies to adopt panther lake for their handheld pc. They did not have much luck with lunar lake.,Negative
AMD,"Assuming intel also keeps those mobile CPUs a good price, this could be really good. Hopefully as well they add the B390 in their high power desktop CPUs, seeing a core ultra 5 with an iGPU like this would really mitigate the need for a dedicated GPU right away Mostly because iGPUs on other generations were bad, and only a select few Ryzen CPUs had the 890M.

AMD,"This ain't gonna matter. It's the sku with 50% more igpu cores compared to lunarlake, which already has an igpu that's larger than the hx 370, it's real expensive. Imagine a hx370 with 26cu instead of 16, that's the price range you're lookin at  Any system built with this is gonna need to run at extremely high mem speed to feed the really large igpu which in the current market with insane ram prices is gonna be priced out of most people's budget. Are ya prepared for a gaming handheld that costs north of $1500?

AMD,No?  People will still value AMD more ue to brand so Intel will have to rely on volume for revenue  For reference only yesterday on this sub we had people talking about Intel lacking efficiency in comparison in mobile space,Neutral
AMD,Crazy AMD haven't updated their iGPU to RDNA 4. I know they're probably waiting for UDNA but it would have been almost 3 years on the same architecture by the time we get the UDNA refresh next year (if they even bring it to their APUs right away). Sort of disappointing.,Negative
AMD,"tbf the most important issue is, few games implemented XeSS, just like AMD FSR.  And I think XeSS 3 being implemented in more games is a net positive for AMD GPU too.",Positive
AMD,"With everything happening around NVIDIA´s price increases and AMD´s lack of providing updates where it hurts, it **feels like** AI-Datacenters are more important right now for them (like the last 2 years).  But who can resent them as Intel had products that where not so much competitive that time.    Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.   Now let them release a B770 that is rumoured to be fairly mid/high range and we can hope for competition that actually learned from bad products recently and tries to make it better.",Neutral

AMD,What do you mean that a refreshed Strix Point can’t compete with an updated architecture?,Neutral
AMD,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
AMD,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.  I don't understand why AMD decided to price Strix Point and Strix Halo so ridiculously -- it's their market for the taking.",Neutral
AMD,I think they’re trying to take away business from Qualcomm/arm on windows before it takes off,Neutral
AMD,Intel charts for their gpus have been pretty on point   Msi claw with lunar lake is one of the best handhelds,Positive
AMD,"Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds, Intel just didn't have anything else so they slapped that on the MSI Claw. Now the options should be much better considering they are selling a lower core Xe3 version for cheap too",Negative
AMD,"I'm just curious how they handle the need for such high speed RAM on desktop though? I guess this is an application where CAMM2 will be required, I don't think DDR5-9600+ is possible without it and this is presumably pretty key to the performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It certainly would make a huge difference because iGPUs are very memory bandwidth bound; and as the name suggests, LPDDR5 9600 has literally twice the bandwidth of the JEDEC standard 4800.  Unfortunately I doubt we'll see reasonably priced laptops with LPDDR5 9600 -- even as an add-on option. I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800; and many SKUs that were 2x16GB are now 1x16GB; yes **single channel**.... they charge you extra if you want 2x8GB.",Neutral

AMD,X9 and X7 have 12 Xe cores and the best Ultra 5 has 10 Xe cores,Positive
AMD,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
AMD,Example?,Neutral
AMD,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from. In another graph featuring supposedly ""native"" 1080p, they claimed Arc B390 was 82% faster than the HX 370 (why don't they just call it Radeon 890M though...)",Neutral
AMD,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral
AMD,"If it was only a 73% gain *including* MFG, then that would be a serious performance regression. If they were using MFG in their graphs, it would easily be 200% - 300% ""faster"" at the same ""real"" performance",Negative
AMD,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
AMD,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral
AMD,"There are 50% more GPU cores here than on Lunar or Arrow Lake. CPU is still 16 cores as well compared to Arrow Lake, just shifted from 6+8+2 to 4+8+4.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you mean Strix Halo?  Halo is made up of THREE dies. Two are regular CCD and one is a ~300mm2 graphics die. Total die area is around 440mm2 IIRC.  It's expensive, but not THAT expensive.",Neutral
AMD,Doesn't this depend on use case? AMD laptops are more capable for gaming and the iGPU can also use the lesser version of FSR. Intel is obv better for productivity.,Positive
AMD,"I disagree, Arrow lake HX seems to be more expensive than AMD HX as least on Lenovo Legion Pro setup.   I would have buy Arrow lake for the same price but AMD is cheaper by $200.",Negative
AMD,Eh? It's a standard 128 bit memory bus.​,Neutral
AMD,"You can't price it higher than people are willing to pay, how high that is I have no idea, people bonkers buying CPU only laptops at these high prices if gaming is something they really want to do.",Negative
AMD,Oems magically dont price intel variants as if they were made out of gold?,Negative
AMD,"Lmao check the data, Intel has 79% of the laptop market share currently",Neutral
AMD,"Reddit isn’t indicative of anything really, most casual laptop buyers don’t even know what AMD is.",Negative
AMD,"I wouldn't be surprised if this is because the team has chosen to focus efforts on UDNA because that's the architecture next-gen consoles would use. They only have so much talent and headcount on their graphics division after all, and consoles have much higher volume (even tho low margins) and thus take priority.",Neutral
AMD,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
AMD,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Neutral
AMD,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.  Ampere (crypto bubble ignoring) was priced well and many excellent cards in there since it was on Samsung, a cheap fab; while DC/workstation chips got TSMC.",Neutral
AMD,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
AMD,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient. Base power levels tell you nothing really.",Neutral
AMD,"[It's actually closer to Battlemage than Celestial. Straight from Tom Petersen](https://youtu.be/P2AsCkKi-vs?t=1576)  >""Unfortunately that Xe3 name got decided years ago, it's actually spread around the Linux stack. Changing the name of that would have been very, very painful. So, that's why you're seeing this disjointedness abut Intel Arc ""B"" series. **Well, [Panther Lake] is B series because it's similar to Xe2** and we want to be transparent with our customers. Panther Lake has a new and improved GPU, that GPU is bigger and **it's very similar to B series.**""",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, it's a proper generational jump. Intel marketing is just dumb, and the comments from Peterson claiming Xe3 is somehow a smaller jump than Xe3p are just laughable.",Negative
AMD,The reason is marketing (the Battlemage brand is hot and filled with good will ATM so resetting to celestial so soon is not ideal regardless of panther Lake being xe³) Peterson addressed this a bit ago.,Neutral
AMD,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
AMD,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.  I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
AMD,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
AMD,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
AMD,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
AMD,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
AMD,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
AMD,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
AMD,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
AMD,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
AMD,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
AMD,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
AMD,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
AMD,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
AMD,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive
AMD,They're a lot more accurate than whatever the fuck Nvidia has been doing where you have to decode their bar graphs for proper scaling lmao,Negative
AMD,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too. There were heaps of MSI Claw promotional booths / draws at shopping malls / public places in Australia and it was heavily discounted.  I picked one up for about $550 AUD (after rebates; tax included), which is like $369 USD inclusive of tax.",Neutral
AMD,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds. Something like the Radeon 890M have done fine with such speeds",Neutral
AMD,"> I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800   You're looking at normal DDR, not LPDDR. LPDDR5-9600 *is* a JEDEC spec, and already available in mobile.",Neutral
AMD,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral
AMD,"I doubt it's exactly 73% outside of cherrypicked games, but it should not be shocking that it's significantly faster than rehashed rdna3.",Neutral
AMD,"Every Intel marketing benchmark for like a decade or so, but especially their GPUs seem to do far better in their benchmarks than they do in reality.",Positive
AMD,"Ice lake, Alder lake, Metor Lake",Neutral
AMD,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
AMD,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
AMD,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

AMD,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

AMD,"If you're referring to the April dump, heck even the August dump (analysis of Kepler\_L2 patents) then that's not close to the complete picture. A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
AMD,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative

These aren't designed for individual buyers, though they certainly won't mind the sales. It's more targeting corporate deployments where a company will want to buy hundreds to thousands or more, have them easily stored in a warehouse that can quickly be deployed when needed. When a computer for work breaks, I let my project manager know and they'll contact logistics to organize a swap, happened a few times last year and recently just had to swap a computer out due to a broken power button. These are super convenient for such cases, especially with office work where they take way more abuse as they remove the fragile screen + hinge on laptops if they're gonna be used in a situation where nobody cares about them.  My main concern is the keyboard. In office, keyboard and mouse are replaced all the time, so having one tied to the rest of the hardware is problematic. Companies often favour buying the cheapest en-masse and replace when broken, as hiring someone to fix expensive stuff that nobody cares about is not cost efficient. Yes you can just plug a new keyboard in, but I do have a bit of e-waste concern if some companies simply decide to throw them out due to speed/efficiency, kinda like how mostly fine laptops that have some broken bits are sadly discarded all the time by companies.  Then again, throwing away this is less wasteful and cost efficient than throwing away a laptop, so maybe it's still net better.",Positive

Same with laptop, refresh the lineup with better clocks, improved firmware etc until the next gen CPU Engine is ready.   For Nvidia, it’s because they do yearly GPU releases, but their other components typically are kept and used for multiple years.  This just happens to be the year that “everything” in their system is going new.  Next year Nvidia will keep everything but the GPUs.

AMD,"Yeah it was pretty rare, you were just way better off getting a 1700X or later the 1700 for way less money and like 95-98% of the same performance. The only area where the 1800X shined was clock speed and even then it basically capped at like 4.0-4.1 GHz on golden samples. You were just better off buying a 1700X and OC'ing it to 1800X clock speed and pocketing the difference or spending it on more RAM or something else.  Notice how AMD basically doesn't allow for a slower speed variant with the same cores anymore on the high end like they used to? If you want a 9950X or 9950X3D you have to buy it. Only lower end SKUs like the 9600X will ever see a 9600 or 9500X with similar specs other than clock speeds. AMD might do a refresh of say the 5950X and make a '5950XT' but that's basically just a new stepping and it releases pretty much late into the lifecycle where it makes no sense to wait for it. You may as well wait another 3-6 months for the next generation stuff as your money goes further and it's a more substantial performance upgrade or has new platform features like PCI-E upgrades, DDR5/DDR6 etc.",Neutral

AMD,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades.

Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.

I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

AMD,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel doesn't have a current gen competitor to SDX2EE right now though ARL HX can be considered from the previous generation.  AMD HX 370 is a heavily nerfed Zen 5 chip, bringing little to no improvement over Zen 4 at per core level.

AMD,"Limited to the same TDP, X2E is still up to 2x on normal Panther Lake TDPs (X7/X9 is 60W TDP), but this is due to the much higher Perf/W QC and Apple have on their uarches.  The die size though you are correct, but if you count all tiles, the difference is simply that Intel allocated the die size to a much fatter GPU instead of CPU where they know they are behind. By going the GPU route, they secure very positive reviews because it carves a niche for them in the market where they are undisputed best.  Intel and AMD simply have lower perf/W. Panther Lake might fix it a bit, but e.g Lunar Lake on N3B was between 1.5-1.7x worse in perf/W vs 4nm X1 in ST",Neutral

My argument was that they are not hiding it, they have published the numbers and demoed the games - unlike Intel trying to keep their CPU performance under wrap till they can generate a mountain worth of goodwill among gamers with their iGPU perf.

AMD,"My guess, based on what AMD has said about RDNA4 and UDNA, is that they didn't put the R&D into cutting RDNA4 down any smaller for iGPU usage. So far RDNA4 only has 2 die configs, 64 and 32cu. The 32cu config is exactly just 1/2 of the symmetrical 64cu config. And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces.  My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them... Just like every new GPU uArch family does for them. TeraScale, GCN, RDNA1. Each first iteration was a mess. I'm betting they wanted to get UDNA into iGPUs a lot sooner, and launch dGPU UDNA afterward. A guess.  NV hasn't been immune to this in the past. The FX Series, Tesla, and Fermi were all either under-performers, or problematic in their first iteration.   And weirdly Blackwell had a lot of initial driver issues.

AMD,Intel has to - companies buy millions of Dell/HP/Lenovo business PCs and servers(HP sold their server business as HPE) - Dell is by far Intel’s most important client.

I read about this app. I don't want to go back there anymore, so I'm honestly working as a car, house, and safe locksmith for insurance companies from Monday to Monday, 9 to 9, a real slave. That's the only way to try to have something. I'm with a wonderful woman today, but for the past few days I've been very suspicious. I went a few days without lunch to hire those cell phone hacking ads, but it's all scams. I'm broke, everything I can get. I was dismantling the shack and building for me, her, and her 3 children. I met some guys in there who talked about the hacking, so I know it's possible to hack her WhatsApp and retrieve deleted conversations, photos, or even find out if she's doing other things.  Please, I know that if any of you are the kind of guy who can help me, you would know some of what you can do, because fidelity and truth are part of who we really are, and I have cheated on other people, but when I decided to get married, there couldn't be any lies. Because even in crime, that doesn't fit, and how can you say you love someone and sleep with them and deceive them? That's a lack of character, not love. I just want to know if it's all in my head or if she's really cheating on me.

K6, Core 1/2, Zen 1, and so on weren't handled like this; those were pitched as proper revolutions, and not only did everyone really believe it, Intel and AMD actually *delivered*!  We already know that AMD doesn't have anything new yet, because Zen 6 is still in development. They don't really *need* anything new yet either, because Zen 5 is still very good for anyone willing to buy into it now. They can wait just fine and talk about other things.  > A year ago, it wasn’t clear what the future of Intel looked like, and just six months ago, there were legitimate questions about whether the brand would even survive.  It is still not even remotely clear what the future of Intel looks like, and the question of whether they'll be sticking around for very long is still extremely valid.

AMD,"> Intel and AMD have switched places.  Yes, they both switched places. AMD with Intel, and Intel with TSMC and Samsung — Mainly due to excessive complacency on Intel's parts, after at least a full-blown decade of stagnation (in the end-user and client-space with quad-cores for a decade straight from 2006–2016), and years of hiccups and delays on process-technology (starting back then with 22nm).  Though I don't really see the point to mention it; AMD just filled a blatant innovation-vacuum Intel crafted over ages.",Neutral
AMD,"> AMD is more and more heavily used in the Enterprise, which is extremely lucrative because of the margins. So they’re more inclined to forget to keep their eyes on the ball in the consumer space.  No. That's actually not the case, like not at all — AMD did **not** just shifted business over to enterprise for margins.  AMD since the Bulldozer-days *always* secretly prepared, to attack Intel fundamentally full-scale and with *everything on all fronts at the same time*. A *All-or-Nothing*-attack with that »All hands on deck!«-mentality from the start …  Their chiplet-approach in and of itself shows, that AMD technologically laid down a fundamental path to success very early, which enabled to aim at virtually everything (from the top at the server-space & enterprise-business down to the end-user, and everything in-between) *from the start*, using *a single yet* ***universally*** *applicable architecture*, which was virtually engineered for years on end with AFAIK millions of man-hours, for being principally usable/applicable for every use-case and market there is, for AMD to go full scale and all-in in the first place — Nothing changed since.  *AMD aimed for enterprise and client from the get-go*. AMD's chiplets, engineered for years, is the obvious evidence.",Neutral
AMD,">Still, it’s a stark contrast from the AMD of even 12 months ago, and an even starker contrast to Intel. Under the leadership of Pat Gelsinger, the public-facing Intel quickly jumped on the AI boom. Presentations became winding events focused on road maps and geopolitics, as Intel tried to play a game it was struggling to be a player in.  I mean the article did point that out.  Intel still leads the market in client PC hardware sales. That's another relevancy they have, and I'm pretty sure they're glad everyone else gloated about AI. And also, mega companies failing to difersify and choosing to stick to their core market is a good thing. You wouldn't want to live in an alternate timeline where Intel bought Nvidia and 3dfx while they were on their last legs in the late 90s.",Neutral

Intel actually did setup a bunch of [testing laptops for Panther Lake at CES](https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/intel-panther-lake-mobile-graphics-entry-level-desktop-performance)  the actual suspicious part is the fact that they were only letting people test the GPU with games, not the CPU",Negative

AMD,"Yeah, instead they should have brought massive AI GPU racks to the **consumer** electronics show, that **consumers** can totally afford to buy!   That being said, Intel probably would have done the same if they had the same footing in the AI market that NVIDIA and more recently AMD now have.",Neutral
AMD,"a year would actually be quite long, Zen 5 launched July 2024. A successor two years later at least for the H2 mobiles would be nice. October/November 2026 desktop release would be reasonable and fit previous cadence, tho there are rumours about a N2X delay.  I think the biggest issue is the lack of a dGPU refresh and the non-existend RDNA4 iGPUs. RDNA5 is likely H2 2027, so sticking with RDNA 3.5 hurts. Most APUs/mobiles will only run a more modern gen starting in mid 2028, if they can even ramp enough beside some Halo SKUs, dGPU and consoles (not even counting AI-GPUs). with the current lack of FSR4 for RDNA 3.5, that's dissappointing, tho they think about backporting.  dual stacked V-cache (each CCD with 2 V-cache layers) and better memory controller/IOD would've been awesome as well.   rumours and leaks obviously had nothing on the radar, so it's not suprising nothing came from CES, but still, Lisa booked a keynote - and brought basically nothing. at last years CES they delayed RDNA4 - so it's the second disappointing keynote in a row.",Neutral
AMD,2018 called and wanted their jokes back,Neutral
AMD,"This is just blatantly false and ""doomposting"". I've seen several people post the same thing as you and here is a small list I compiled of consumer related electronics that were shown:  * Intel showed Panther Lake, which looks really nice. * Pretty much all the big laptop manufacturers showed off their next generation laptops, a lot of which seem pretty nice (a lot of focus on reparability this year). They also showed off a bunch of cool concepts like the computer-in-a-keyboard from HP, the rollable laptop from Lenovo, the dual-screen laptop from Asus. * A lot of monitor news. * A lot of PC case related stuff were shown. * IKEA has launched a bunch of matter devices for home automation as well as a 10 dollar speakers that can pair with up to 100 units. * Motorola showed off their Razr Fold phone. * Nvidia's DLSS 4.5 update seems pretty big and will work on older generations as well. * LG and Samsung both showed off new TVs. The latter showed off micro RGB. * A lot of audio-related stuff like new soundbars, wireless speakers from Samsung, Onkyo and so on. * Razer announced some gaming related stuff if that's what you care about. A new stream deck keyboard, a new controller and so on. Hyperkin also announced a modular clamp-on controller. * A robot vacuum that can climb stairs. * A bunch of car related things were announced as well, such as Ford saying L3 driving will come in 2028. * L'Oreal showed off a flat iron that uses IR light. * Asus showed off a Wi-Fi 8 router. * Lego showed off ""smart bricks"" which seems neat.  I could keep going but I think you get the point. There is a ton of stuff from CES that are consumer related. Just because you were hoping for specific things (probably gaming related) from a handful of specific companies (AMD, Intel and Nvidia) does not mean the entire show is bad or no longer about consumer electronics. There were over 4100 exhibitors at CES this year. Believe it or not, but there were plenty of consumer related stuff being shown.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, Why do people get this idea that these companies are doing us any favors? As soon as the winds shift, they'll be gone.",Negative
AMD,"They also did because, during the span of two generations, they managed to lose most of their enterprise market and almost crash the company. Their last hail Mary is to cater to consumers.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah that's for sure the reason, but regardless it's good for us as consumers and we'll have to take what we can get right now.  Intel could gain some big market share in the CPU and GPU gaming sector if they play the next couple years right.",Positive
AMD,"Also, they had less to gain since their chips were already faster. Its like commending a company for making a fast car when they never had one, vs a company that only makes fast cars.",Negative
AMD,"You say that as if AMD matters too. Spoiler alert, Ai products aren't much use to 90% of the people buying them. All LLMs that most people are used to run in the cloud on insane hardware and not local.  You can run some very small models on these new AMD system but there really aren't very many main stream options for them. I'm just waiting for the bubble to burst so that I can snap some of these up on the cheap.  AMD's ROCm platform is a distant second to NVIDIA. The software support isn't their and AMD is trying to force people into their overpriced enterprise gear instead of supporting their GPUs.  Unless you've dealt with trying to implement your own local LLM stuff, none of this matters. Microsoft is just paying OEMs to brand shit as Ai, as if people need, or want it. Let alone have any idea what they'd use an NPU for.   I do think NPUs are great if you want to keep your data local. But the amount of work and effort is high, furthermore these NPUs are weak. You'll still need a 16gb GPU to run anything larger.",Negative
AMD,You're right. CPUs don't matter at all.,Neutral
AMD,"There is way more to see at CES than overhyped PC gear. If you've never been, it's hard to appreciate. I've worked several shows there just never have had a chance to walk the whole show floor because it is so fricken massive.  My favorite is getting a sneak peak at future production display technologies. I worked some of the shows where OLED was on display nearly 10 years before consumers could afford it. Some of the cutting edge stuff is truly a marvel.",Positive
AMD,"Also, can't buy CPU when no RAM.",Negative
AMD,"You don't get it, it's called AI 400 because it can do AI and it can do 100 more AI than AI 300 which consumers are gonna love because 400 > 300",Positive
AMD,"And if you want it, go with NVIDIA. They know they can jack up the price because their software that more advanced than AMD. Setting up AMD systems is so much more of a pain in the ass. I'm going to get a used 3090 this year because new GPUs are insane.",Positive
AMD,"or they get bank loan and if they fail to pay back, the bank will be in trouble then the gov will bail the bank out.",Neutral
AMD,"The big problem with the chips is that they just take too long to make. Which is driving up cost big time. Instead of just creating the chip in one go, it takes months and many cycles to get a chip built. Which I believe is ultimately not sustainable. Especially if they want to make this AI bubble not burst soon. Because it requires a lot of processing power, which is just not worth the investment for many products.",Negative
AMD,"Handheld is tiny, but the laptop market isn’t.",Neutral
AMD,That would be fucked for anyone who doesn’t want to upgrade.,Negative
AMD,companies will literally pay double for Nvidia so they could avoid ROCm. ROCm is still a broken mess.,Negative
AMD,"Its too expensive, otherwise we would've gotten more vram already",Negative

AMD,This is brain dead.  This is a trade show to show off consumer electronics.   Full stop.,Negative
AMD,"CES revolved around audio and video, including high end professional products, the general public wasn't even allowed to attend until the mid 90s.

AMD,"Yeah the article underestimated the incentives AMD has in deprioritizing the client segment, but this segment is intel's lifeline.

AMD,If by becoming major you mean lost 2nd place to become 3rd because an in-house chip beat them?,Neutral
AMD,"I think he was more speaking about AMD being *at least* the minor player in the AI-space, compared Intel.  Since Intel aren't even really partaking in the whole AI hardware-market for businesses after all and is virtually absent with basically no hardware present (at least *not* in terms of actual enterprise-grade HPC- or AI-hardware), apart from their non-selling Gaudi-accelerators — The only real thing making it to market in several years of ever-delayed and often thrown-out road-maps, even if it turned out to be a complete dud and non-seller.  Because apart from their lackluster client-NPUs, which at first couldn't even qualify for the minimum Windows-requirements for anything AI (which is a huge embarrassing fail in and of itself, blatantly showing how Intel trails behind), there's no real AI-/HPC-hardware from Intel at all.  ---- AMD in the other hand, sports a whole line of AI- and HPC-hardware for the enterprise, and is the only one remotely close to nVidia, powers the world's #1 and #2 supercomputers these days and gets government-contracts for that.",Neutral

AMD,"Can any ""high IQ"" Redditer explain the downvotes? What exactly is the issue with asking if intel has a CUDA equivalent?",Neutral
AMD,"The difference is AMD’s mobile GPU’s have stagnated.   They haven’t had a noticeable improvement since their first RDNA 3 based iGPU’s in like 2023. Strix Point uses RDNA “3.5” which is shockingly poor in terms of gains from the RDNA 3 iGPU’s which launched in 2023.   Just for context, Intel’s Lunar Lake iGPU’s were Xe2 and [were beating Strix Point last year.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Lunar-Lake-iGPU-analysis-Arc-Graphics-140V-is-faster-and-more-efficient-than-Radeon-890M.894167.0.html)  I get it sounds “controversial” to some people in here, who see the success of AMD in handhelds and such, but again, most of those handhelds were made back when these RDNA 3 based iGPU’s launched. The Z1 was RDNA 3 and is used in most handhelds because, at the time in 2023, it was the best option available.  They’ve sat twiddling their thumbs after securing one win in 2023 that everyone else has caught up or surpassed them in mobile GPU efficiency and performance per watt.  Strix Halo has the same issue, the only difference they’ve done is increased memory bandwidth and increased the power. So in terms of perf/watt it’s still bad despite the fact that it is a good performing GPU.   “RDNA 3.5” is nonsense. AMD seemingly can’t seem to make a better iGPU with any measurable performance/watt improvements than what they did in 2023.  They’ve improved their CPU performance, with Zen 5 based processors, but again just disappointing iGPU improvements.",Negative
AMD,"> the actual suspicious part is the fact that they were only letting people test the GPU with games, not the CPU  Not suspicious, it's simply that the CPU is nothing special, no more than a node sidegrade and a very minor IPC bump.  Meanwhile the GPU is actually a good step forward, also because of a lack of real competition.",Negative
AMD,"And I think they were only letting people test the X7 and X9 parts (with has the 12 core GPU), not the normal u7 and u9 parts which will be far more common and only has a 4 core GPU (almost half of what's in Lunar Lake).     Panther Lake looks nice but depending on which chip you compare it to it seems like it will be a side-grade or even a downgrade compared to Intel's previous generation, and they aren't letting anyone test those areas.",Neutral
AMD,"But you need to be careful when ordering Intel SKUs. The top Nova Lake SKU has 3x the power draw of the rest of the line.

AMD,"Honestly a 7600x system isn't impossible for that price, but I would probably advise to go for a DDR4 AM4 system instead to leave more budget for a GPU.   Something like a 5600x with a 5060/9060xt would net you way better gaming performance over a 7600x and an older GPU. The downside being there isn't really any upgrade path past the 5600x going that route.  With the way pricing is right now and having that budget, you kind of need to decide do I want more performance in games today, or an easier upgrade path 3-5 years from now.",Neutral

AMD,"No it is correct, the 7600x is only for DDR5, I was saying to go with the older generation 5600x or similar that would work with DDR4.   The money saved on the AM4 CPU, DDR4 ram and motherboard could go towards a far faster GPU and would be a way better overall gaming machine.   Sure the 7600x is a better CPU, but going for the 5600x would be a far more balance system.

AMD,"All will handle it. For per $ performance Mid level is the best, but I’m not recommend go with outdated AM4. If money not the problem go with pro level+ with 9800/9850X3D (it is Ryzen 7, not 9). 7800X3D will work well too, but I will pay extra $80 for a bit better performance.",Neutral
AMD,"The mid-level gives the most bang-for-the-buck, by a significant margin.  The High-End is not worth it over the Pro-Level-Plus.  The Pro-Level-Plus is \*barely\* worth it over the Pro-Level-Minus, save for the x3D feature on the CPU.   If you're trying to buy once and not again for 10 years, then spend as much as possible.",Negative
AMD,7800X3D with either 9070XT or 5070ti imo. 5080 is way too expensive for not enough performance increase,Negative
AMD,"Currently, the hardware sweetspot is 1440p gaming on a 27"" monitor.  Monitor should be OLED, which is highly recommended.  This would be my take:   \- storage: 2 TB M.2 SSD (do not take 1 TB cause it will not be enough for games, 2 TB is truly great. Also 2 x 1 TB is not really recommended either)  \- GPU: Radeon RX 9070 XT, which is the best bang for what it offers now.  \- 850W Gold or Platinum PSU, at least ATX 3.0 supported  Now, CPU is a great question. You could either go with:  \- Ryzen 7 7800x3d  \- 2x16GB (32 GB) DDR5 6000 MHz Cl30 ram (note that e.g. a CL38 latency often performs worse than DDR4)   Or:  \- Intel CPU, it the following strength order: 12600KF < 14500 < 12700KF < 14600KF < 14700KF  \- 2x16GB (32 GB) DDR4 3600 MHz Cl18 ram  Motherboard can be a lot nice to be found, also PC case as you wish.  Regarding CPU cooler just take any dual tower cheap cooler, a great idea would be Phantom Spirit 120.  Some notes to take:  \- I would really recommend to buy your stuff as soon as possible, GPU and SSD prices might be skyrocketing very soon after RAM prices  \- do NOT buy only 16 GB (DDR4-5) RAM, it is not enough  \- non X3D AMD CPU-s do not really worth it. In that case, just go for Intel, which also has DDR4 support for great budget saving.  \- follow this guy, he has great comments: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1psnsbg/comment/nvazhh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",Positive

AMD,"I take your point on matched ram sticks (that's why I got 2 x 16gb for my build 5 years ago), but with the current RAM prices and a budget build, you would be better off buying 2 X 8gb now and upgrading to 2 x 16gb in a few years when prices are hopefully a lot lower.  In terms of whether 16gb is enough for gaming, hardware unboxed did a comparison recently of 8 Vs 16 vs 32 GB gaming. Conclusion was 16gb is perfectly fine for 95% of games, which was a little surprising to me but can't argue with the data.   So those on a budget can definitely hold off on 32gb for a few years. Unless they want to play current and future triple A titles, but then they shouldn't be doing a budget build. Better to put the savings into a video card with more than 8gb VRAM and then upgrade RAM in 2-3 years. Because you can upgrade your system ram easily but not the VRAM.",Neutral

A minimum, I think it's something that everyone who is budget restricted should give a shot; especially if you're more of a patient gamer. For me, a 5700XT to a 4070 Ti Super felt like a brand new computer that didn't really need anything else.   In my case, I never actually naturally encountered a title that my 3600 couldn't run that I really wanted to play. Sure I saw some in benchmarks showing that some titles experienced sub-70FPS, but seeing it is different than actually encountering it in my natural course of gaming. Plus.. it's pretty much the same as seeing a title on PS5 or Switch that interests me, but I'll probably never play because I don't have a PS5 or Switch.  Sure some titles would also perform better than my 3600 could when paired with a 4070 Ti Super, but for the most part 90FPS or higher feels fine to me and I only have a 144hz 1440p monitor that I can't really tell the difference at between 110FPS and 144FPS. DLSS feels perfect fine and really carries the 3600 pretty far.   In all honesty, Hell Let Loose was the only title that I ever really naturally encountered that made the 3600 feel a bit tired, but by all means it was playable.   I did eventually move on to first a 5600 and then a 7600x, but that was more of a no-brainer financial decision. I found super good prices on both when prices were good ($110 on the CPU/mobo/RAM side of things after selling my old mobo/RAM/CPU). In all honesty, I couldn't personally say I've naturally encountered any game-changing improvements with either the 5600 or 7600x. Again, there definitely are some out there. Especially BF6. But you can stretch a 3600 extremely far and get great results (until you run into something that you flat out can't that's under 60FPS).   I've since played a couple games that my 3600 probably would have struggled with, but in all honesty they were titles I thought were overrated and could have lived without and that was my experience playing them. Had I upgraded from a 3600 to 7600x with the current prices and knew better, I'd probably have pretty bad buyers remorse.",Neutral

AMD,"The 14600k puts up a good fight against the 5500X3D... when the Intel CPU is using DDR5. With DDR4 it's about 10\~20% slower so the 5500X3D absolutely rocks it.  In heavy multi-core workloads, yes, the 14600KF will beat it, but that's not really most productivity applications, just some very *specific* ones. The most common one pointed towards being video encoding, but most people are going to want to use the GPU to do that which is going to be several orders of magnitude faster. CPU video encoding is only necessary for extremely high quality & bit rate encoding or if you need to encode into video formats that the GPU encoder doesn't support. It's mostly used as a CPU benchmarking tool because it's one of the few semi-real world use cases that stress out a multi core CPU, not because it's something people will actually do very often.

AMD,"Put those money into higher tier GPU instead - more performance to gain, 14600k + 5070 ti will be faster than 9800x3d with 5070.",Positive
AMD,"Then it's up to you, but get a cheaper board regardless lol.  I think if I were you, I'd buy a used 7800x3d for $300(I see one right now on ebay), get a $150 am5 board with pcie 5, then sell the 14600k on ebay for $240.  The 7800x3d is not only a really fast CPU, but it is also less affected by your slow 5200 ram due to the large vcache. You could spend the extra $100 for a used 9800x3d if you want.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless you have money to burn, it is perfectly fine for gaming. Do you know the model?  Gen 5 m.2 is basically useless for gaming and probably won’t matter for a while. Unless you really need gen 5 for a specific use case but gen4 and even gen3 ssds are still very fast.  Just make sure your power supply can handle the 5070 (>650w is ideal) and it has the proper connections for it(12vhpwr 12 pin) and I see no issues with it",Neutral

AMD,"In that case, go with AM5... B650E boards are like $140-$150, comes with pcie 5 nvme, and has PCIE gen 5 primary slot.  Some b850 boards are also like this, but they are only guaranteed to have nvme pcie gen 5, not the primary slot. So you'd need to do a quick google on the b850 boards to check.  I'm sure there are cheaper LGA1700 boards with pcie gen 5, but I don't know how they're labeled.",Neutral
AMD,"Don't need to get an expensive AM5 board to get pcie gen 5. Lots of great options like B850's that support gen5. I used to always think the top end chipset was just inherently better (thanks Intel marketing) but you'll get just as good of an experience getting a cheaper board, that includes all the features you need.",Positive
AMD,"Money not that issue, kind my worry now is if I stick with lga 1700 not that much options for cpu update in the future. With amd it's the newest one and kinda no need to buy new cpu or motherboard for a while. I5 14600k is good but not better than 9800x3d. I see bundle of AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D + TUF Gaming X870-PLUS WiFi for $680",Neutral
AMD,"In that case I’d just replace the gpu. Save the money or consider moving it into a better gpu like the 9070xt for an even better gaming experience (more vram, higher frames etc.)  That’s a pretty high wattage psu in that pc, does it have a gpu in it already?",Positive
AMD,"Yeah but it’s not like you are investing more money into the lga1700 system, you already have it.  You also don’t gain anything by moving to am5 right now, if you wanted to switch later and get a newer x3d chip you would just shift the buying of the motherboard to then. You already have the ddr5 which is the hard part.  I’m not seeing the logic unless you really want the x3d right now. I don’t really see the value in replacing such a recent and high performing cpu.  At the very least you could try out the pc with the gpu and decide if you really need to upgrade the cpu. Does that computer have a gpu already? I’d be wary of spending lots of money for minor improvements.",Negative

AMD,"Put the 680$ for the amd platform upgrade towards a higher tier gpu and keep the 14600k, don’t buy a 12gb card in 2026. Find a 5080 for msrp before it’s too late!",Neutral
AMD,"Do you think it worth it to go to 5080, or wait for a new GPU release",Neutral
AMD,5080 gives not much performance increase at a pretty big premium. Wouldn’t really recommend it’s not a very sensible choice imo.  Probably not a good idea to wait on the gpu.. if you want one get it now. Prices are going up and may not come down for a while.

AMD,"For GPU, AMD is usually the value choice, and nVidia the 'performance' choice but also tends to be more expensive in most countries. So in case of your son, he's probably trying to save some $ so he's going with AMD GPU.  For CPUs... Intel blew up with 13th/14th gen CPU degradation issue, and their new Core Ultra CPUs aren't that much better vs. last gen stuff in gaming. AMD's X3D CPU is the king of gaming CPU, and your son could upgrade to it anytime, while if he bought Intel now, he'd be screwed as Intel's next-gen CPU that could potentially take on the X3D CPU will be on yet another whole new socket.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes it is, I also switched to AMD after lifetime of Intel.  AMD is cheaper, has better performance and supports new CPUs on existing motherboards for several generations, intel does not.  GPUs are also much better in terms of bang for the buck. Next I am switching to AMD for GPU as well.",Positive
AMD,AMD makes the fastest gaming CPUs (the X3D models). AMD is also more power efficient. Intel has a very slight lead in productivity single core performance but at the expense of much higher power consumption. Also the higher end recent Intel chips had problems frying themselves.,Positive
AMD,"As always, it's not that easy. You've got to consider you options based on your budget, not just what's the best at top end.  AMD's X3D line is the cream of the crop, but they're expensive, especially considering DDR5 prices.  AMD's lower end stuff is just okay, where they really shine is upgradability, for example the 5800X3D was released 5 years after the 1600X, offers like double the performance, but runs in the same board.  Intel's 13th and 14th gen is extremely good value right now, but they had **serious** reliability issues which are supposedly fixed.  Intel's newest stuff, Ultra series, was super underwhelming on arrival, but prices have dropped, making them competitive again. But DDR5.  Edit: For GPUs it's even more complicated, AMD generally falls behind in modern features (worse upscaler, RT performance), but nvidia skimps on basic oomph, particularly with VRAM which is very relevant with poorly coded Unreal 5 games (which are the norm right now). You're basically going to have to find benchmarks for the specific games you want to play.",Negative
AMD,"That depends. Its like fashion. From the user point of view, they both work. No problem there.  Thing is, when the user is a nerd-face (in a good way) or somehow demanding with computer performance, then choosing the right CPU is decisive.  In all my computers, I always had Nvidia GPUs powered by an AMD CPU. Only in my most recent build, I decided to go to an i5. At least where I live, AMD CPUs were going up in price so I gave Intel a chance.  And honestly, this build is working too well. Considering is not a top notch: i5 12400F with 32 GB DDR4 (currently with 16 only; the other 16 were refunded for malfunctioning after a few months; waiting for another 16 GB to be delivered). GPU is an RTX3050 (yeah, not the ideal, but then again, I got it at a discount and every other GPU was ridiculously expensive for my budget). Main drive is an NVMe and all the others are Sata hard drives. This build works pretty well considering I do video and photo editing in this machine.  So botom line, it all comes down to the user preferences. I never cared much about ""what is the first choice now"". I want to know MY first choice, that is what matters.",Positive
AMD,"For gaming builds, AMD is the current favourite. Outside of that space, Intel remains very strong. And things do change. Have you seen the new Intel Panther Lake CPUs? We are about to see a wave of genuinely tiny, gaming capable mini PCs that will go far beyond what current AMD based mini PCs can offer.",Positive
AMD,AMD x3d chips are king atm with CPUs. And their top of the line GPU is better for price point compared to the same cost for a nvidia gpu.,Positive
AMD,"Yes, AMD is currently the better choice for longevity, value, and performance. The AM5 platform will support new CPUs until 2027+ while Intel's newest platform only supports a single generation of chips.  There are use cases for the newest Intel CPUs but not in the gaming world.  AMD vs Nvidia on the GPU side comes down to value. AMD (and Intel depending on price point), comes in with better pricing at each performance tier.",Positive
AMD,Yes for CPU and price to performance GPU.,Neutral

AMD,Amd has been standard for cpu for a bunch of years now,Neutral
AMD,"Intel kept making poor business decisions one after the other and now they are basically in the same situation as AMD a few years back but maybe even worse, while they still have a decent market share AMD is slowly sucking it all up.",Negative
AMD,Yeah  ...  This happens every few years  P4 era Intel were shit and AMD took Over  Core2 era AMD were shit and Intel took Over  Some time 8th-10th gen CoreI era Intel got a bit shit and AMD took over  ...  It will probably switch again in another 5-10 years,Negative
AMD,"For CPU it's been AMD for quite some time. It's better from a pure gaming POV, far superior socket type support, and more cost effective. The other part is that AMD isn't like Intel by discontinuing support for a specific type of hardware in their CPU that's crucial for 4k blu-ray DRM.... I'm particularly spiteful of this",Positive
AMD,"I'm using an Nvidia 3080ti and a ryzen 5 9000 series  Had my am4 socket mobo blow up, that had one of those 3dx ryzen 7s and figured I'd cheap out on the CPU and get killer ram, super high end Mobo for now. Even with the ryzen 5, system has never ran better. I don't even know if I'm gonna upgrade it now, considering how great everything is running 🤷  That's my 2¢ Ryzen with Nvidia. Been revisiting cyberpunk and I'm fkn blown away",Positive
AMD,"I assume you haven't built a PC since ~2017?      Ryzen started to hit shelves around then, the first two Generations were a little worse than Intel, but even back then, the writing was on the wall that there would be real competition incoming in the CPU space.",Negative
AMD,"For cpu definitely. Amd started making a comeback in 2017 with the launch of Ryzen. They were slowly gaining market share up until 2022, then in 2022 they came out with the X3D tech, and in 2023 Intels 13th/14th gen cpus started blowing themselves up. Making Ryzen the go-to choice.  For gpus its all down to price and what features you want. NVidia is basically all-in on high end, (>700$) and has been making some terrible low-mid tier gpus for fairly high prices. Amd has been making much more attractive mid tier options. Amd is little behind Nvidia RT/AI tech wise, so if you really want those features, or need Cuda cores for work applications. I would say most people (especially a 12yo) should go for a 9600xt 16gb. It's plenty powerfull",Positive
AMD,"I've had a bit of everything throughout the years, including Cyrix 😋. Currently, AMD CPUs, although Intel seems to finally catching up.  For GPUs, it is not as clear cut, depending on specific use cases, but generally speaking, for gaming, AMD has better price to performance.",Positive
AMD,Management with MBA instead of engineering degree... That's what happened....,Neutral
AMD,"AMD has been the front runner for CPUs for a couple of years now. Mainly since the Ryzen CPUs became a thing. For GPUs it is not necessarily AMD that is the top choice I think NVIDIA still dominates in general but AMD is more budget friendly. For example I bought the RX 7900 XTX 2 years ago and it was essentially the best GPU AMD had for private consumers at the time, and it was around 800-1100€. Compare that to the top models of NVIDIA which now clock in at more than 2k, and even the ""cheaper"" cards of NVIDIA are often more expensive or equal than the most expensive AMD card (e.g 5080, 5070).   I mainly chose my AMD card because it came with 24 GB of VRAM which back then only the 4090 had, and even now the best the ""cheaper"" cards of AMD have is 16GB.",Positive
AMD,"Pretty much. For CPU definitely, they hold the performance crown at the top end (9800X3D) and continue to provide great value and long term support for their product stack.  GPU is more debatable. Nvidia comfortably has a monopoly on the halo tier products. So money no object Nvidia stomp. In the middle to upper middle AMD are very competitive, usually offering better performance at better price points at the cost of some features (eg less advanced ray tracing, MFR and DLSS 4.0).  So your son is pretty much correct, all AMD systems often represent the best your money can buy for most users.",Positive
AMD,AMD for gaming  Intel for NAS setups because of quick sync,Neutral
AMD,"As someone who is close to upgrading CPU in the near future the problem with AMD is that their newer CPU motherboards aren't DDR4 compatible. This means if you want to upgrade to AMD from a DDR4 rig you're going to have to spend a gazillion dollars on DDR5 32GB+ on top of the CPU, MOBO.",Negative
AMD,Yes AMD is the current choice. Intel sat on their ass for 10 years and it cost them deeply. From 2007-2017 best consumer CPU's were quad cores. But for some reason 6 months after AMD released Ryzen Intel was able to add more cores for consumer CPU's with the 6 core 8700K.,Neutral
AMD,"It's true only for CPUs, for GPUs Nvidia is still overwhelmingly dominant.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah AMD's the clear winner this round. I just bought a 9800X3D. My last AMD CPU was an Athlon 64!     BTW, be sure to upgrade to the latest bios",Positive
AMD,I'm still on 2022 meta when Intel was still being somewhat competitive imo. I3-12100F RX6600 was the best budget combo at the time. Intel has been downfall ever since,Positive
AMD,"Again, it all comes down to your budget and needs. If we're strictly speaking games, CPU wise AMD is at the top with their X3D chips. On the GPU side of things, it comes down to which is a better deal between similar cards. AMD usually has the price advantage and extra VRAM while Nvidia's got their proprietary features like DLSS or CUDA. However, AMD only has competition in the GPU space up until the 5070 Ti/4080 with their 9070 XT/7900 XTX respectively. They don't have anything against the 5080, 4090 and 5090.",Neutral
AMD,Intel let too many talkers lead the company,Neutral
AMD,"AMD started taking the fight to Intel in 2017 when the first generation of Ryzen came out.  &nbsp;  Honestly Intel had like 15 years of uncontested leadership and got complacent.  &nbsp;  Ryzen has continued to improve over time and with the release of X3D's, Intel just hasn't had an answer to it.  &nbsp;  That plus Intel CPU's specifically the 13th and 14th Generation products (K SKU's) have had issues with frying themselves.  Microcode updates and BIOS updates have mostly mitigated the issues but they don't undo any damage that's already done.  &nbsp;  15th Generation or ""Intel Core Ultra"" products have generally been underwhelming for gaming workloads and tend to get annihilated by similar tier AMD X3D and non-X3D parts.  There's some games where the 285K even loses to the 5800X3D, 5700X3D and 5600X3D.   &nbsp;  Dragon's Dogma 2, FFXIV Dawntrail, F1 24, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and Assetto Corsa: Competizione are a few examples of where Intel's 285K loses hard to Ryzen X3D and Non-X3D, even older generation X3D's.  &nbsp;  ACC for example the 285K with DDR5 7200 is still -  - 17% slower than the 5800X3D - 31% slower than the 7900X3D - 32% slower than the 7950X3D - 33% slower than the 7800X3D.   &nbsp;  To give Intel some credit - They're still fantastic for Productivity or production workloads.  &nbsp;  I hope their BLLC technology brings the fight to X3D - A competitive market is beneficial for us as consumers.   &nbsp;  As for GPU's I presume the reason your son wants AMD is probably because he doesn't want to take a risk with the 12VHPWR / 12V2x6 Fire Hazard power connector that's on Nvidia's GPU's.",Neutral
AMD,I don't know but it's been a master class on how to go from single digit market share to nearly even in the consumer space and double digit enterprise share in less than a decade from AMD. Turns out consumers will choose high core counts and extended platform support. 2 sockets in a decade is impressive.,Positive
AMD,"100% amd cpu, id say the gpu though is a toss up and depends on preference, amd has very good price to performance but if your nvidia option is any less than a 5080 i wouldnt consider nvidia unless youre just really loyal to the brand or something",Neutral

AMD,CPU is AMD for sure  For the GPU it's a bit of murky waters situation... basically you need to pick and choose between pros and cons  Very big ones too,Neutral
AMD,"AMD CPU if you are gaming with the x3d, for productivity Intels single core performance is way up there, also running 4 sticks of ram on the AMD platform at full speed is difficult but with Intel it’s not a problem. Nvidia GPUs are the best 5070ti, 4090, 5080 or 5090 doesn’t have real competition and are better optimized.",Positive
AMD,"Speaking as a bystander making a couch assessment, what happened is that Intel got comfortable with calculated incremental improvements and it was too late to fix things when they realized this gave the competition the edge.  Then they had some devastating design mishaps, which I am tempted to consider related to the scramble mode they put themselves into.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, Intel has fallen behind; especially for gaming PCs.  The GPU discussion is more divisive. A lot of people feel Nvidia GPUs still perform/look better, and their tech currently has more game support. On the other hand they're significantly more expensive than their AMD equivalents.    But if you want an Nvidia GPU hurry up and buy one. Really, hurry up and buy  either because Radeon prices are about to rise again as card makers discontinue more Geforce models due to unavailability.  And then there's the whole RAM disaster.",Negative
AMD,For at least 6 years this has been the trend. I would say the 3600 chip broke AMD out and everything since then has crushed Intel,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, for gaming the future is now old man",Positive
AMD,I switched to AMD in 2017 after they promised long term support for the AM4 socket.  And it's paid off. 3 different gen of CPUs on the same motherboard.  Their 3D-cache CPUs are killer for gaming now too.  I still prefer Nvidia GPUs though. I've never had good experiences with AMD GPUs.,Positive
AMD,"My last two builds have been AMD on AMD. Not going into it with any bias in mind, I've used intel and nvidia since I was a kid getting into it. Built an R7 3700x with a 6700xt and it would run just about anything, when it slowed down, just recently I built R7 7800x3D and 9070XT and I'm more than happy with it. Both times it just came down to bang for your buck",Positive
AMD,Intel sadly got complacent. I went with Intel when I upgraded in 2023 but next time will likely be AMD unless something changes.,Negative
AMD,"Both AMD and Intel make great CPUs.  AMD makes the best gaming chip.  Intel makes the best productivity chip.  Intel charges more for their products,  AMD is as good or almost as good in every category, and always a better value price wise.  Intel was clearly the leader 10 years ago, but fell behind.  AMD appeared to innovate and improve with the Ryzen architecture, while Intel stagnated with Skylake and its iterations.  Intel also hit a roadblock with its foundry and had trouble shrinking the process node, while AMD outsources its production to TSMC who was quickly and efficiently making smaller, faster, cooler chips.  Intel has innovated recently with its mixed performance/efficiency core chips (similar to modern smartphones).  Intel is also on a completely new architecture (definitely some hiccups in implementation).  They’ve also adopted the chiplet manufacturing process  (about 8 years after AMD).  They are doing what they need to catch back up, but are behind AMD and are dealing with the technological challenges of rolling out a new architecture and manufacturing processes (which you could argue AMD/TSMC already dealt with in the early days of the Ryzen architecture).  Despite losing market share and not keeping up with AMD, Intel continues to charge more for their chips as well as introduce a new socket every other year.  Hence AMD is cheaper, and in many cases an upgrade is just updating the BIOS and dropping a new chip in.  Whereas with Intel you have to buy a new mobo every time.  There were other issue such as 13 and 14 series Intel chips frying themselves (Intel kept competitive buy pushing more power and upping the core frequency-those generation chip ran HOT).  They had to implement BIOS and micro code updates that helped keep the chips from frying themselves, but also reduced performance.  At the same time, Microsoft released a patch that fixed a scheduler issue which was affecting AMD processors and boosted performance in many games (be wary of AMD reviews from before the Windows 24H2 update).  For GPUs I think NVIDIA still has the better products especially at the top end.  At the midrange and lower tiers they are still putting out cards with 8 and 12 GB of VRAM which are not aging well with Games and monitors pushing 1440p and 4K graphics.  It doesn’t help that NVIDIA are charging ridiculous prices for their cards (most of which you can’t find at MSRP).  AMD has done a good job keeping up, but gave up this last generation on trying to compete with NVIDIAs flagship cards (they didn’t want to make a card that cost over $1,000).  The ones that they did make are a better value than their NVIDIA counterparts.",Positive
AMD,"Intel fell from grace back around 2010.  Intel had too many sockets, problematic releases, poor support, poor performance, and were frankly overpriced.  AMD came in showing strong competition in the 2000s, but then really stepped it up with the Ryzen era chips in the mid 2010s.  At that point, AMD was putting out CPUs that were straight up better, and cheaper, while being better for home use.  While AMD is still a step or two behind Nvidia for graphics, they are a strong competitor at this point.  AMD used to have driver issues, support issues, stability issues, etc.  The shift here happened around the same time as their gains in the CPU department.  The mid 2010s were a major turning point for AMD GPUs.  Comparative FPS rates, cheaper prices.  My previous builds going back 27 years have all been Intel/Nvidia.  My latest build all team red, and I honestly couldn't be happier.  AMD currently makes up about 43% of the CPU market share.  A lot of intel's market share is propped up by government and business PCs.  The home market is heavily swayed in AMDs favor due to price.  Nvidia is still VERY dominant in the GPU market.  AMD has less than 10% of the market share.  Nvidia pushes the top end harder than AMD does, which then gives them clout.  They also offer a more robust low end offering than AMD.  The mid-market is where AMD really shines due to performance and price.",Neutral
AMD,"He's totally right about CPU.  GPU is complicated. Firstly Nvidia have all the market cap right now and they use it be scumbags. If you want to vote with your wallet thats a point for AMD.  AMD also caught up in a big way on the frame generation and raytracing with the 9000 series.   However with the recent news about DLSS 4.5 Nvidia might be a clear cut choice for performance again. We will have to see what AMD can bring to the table soon.  So yeah, although I have sworn off giving my money to Nvidia, you should know that they have some pretty impressive improvements coming their cards very soon.  AMD is still excellent though, drivers are stable these days and you can get the infamous 12VHPWR cable that has almost no built in system to detect if it is drawing all of its power through a single pair of pins. This means they are prone to burning up and bricking cards.  Don't be afraid of AMD and I recommend them, but it wouldn't be honest of me not to admit that Nvidia has it's advantages.",Neutral
AMD,"For CPU, absolutely. AMD has been on top most of the time since Ryzen came out (and we're up to the 5th generation of Ryzen now).  For graphics, it's less clear cut. AMD often gets you more raw bang for your buck - but nVidia has better drivers, much better raytracing, and DLSS.  There are valid reasons to pick either.",Positive
AMD,"AMD has been top choice for at least the last 5 years and was very competitive 3 years before that.  It also Helps AM4 has been super long lived, and AM5 is starting to look like it will be just as long lived to.",Positive
AMD,"You cannot go wrong with an x3D AMD chip.  Current GPUs (highest to lowest performance)  Current AMD GPUs: 9070XT, 9070, 9060 XT  Current Nvidia GPUs: 5090, 5080, 5070 TI, 5070, 5060 TI, 5060, 5050  Intel GPUs do exist and they are surprisingly good, and inexpensive. I just feel as if they may not be the best recommendation due to compatibility issues. I.e, I used an Intel GPU for my dad's office PC (he likes to use multiple high res monitors and was interested in being able to play some games potentially, but not a main focus) but I probably wouldn't choose to use it in a gaming specific build. Intel GPUs are not always capable of running older titles. AMD or Nvidia would probably provide a more seamless experience right now.  Currently if it was me building right now, I would lean away from Intel CPUs. Intel's new CPU line (panther lake) is supposed to come out within the next 12 months or so.. the new line looks very enticing but we have to wait for actual performance testing and benchmarks. If you aren't planning to build for another year-ish, maybe check that out because they look really good. In the meantime, with AMDs x3D chips you basically know you are getting a best in slot gaming CPU, so I would go with that.  GPUs are not how they used to be. Low/mid grade GPUs are nearly extinct being $400-500 or more. Recently there have been  more options in the sub $400 range. The 5060 or 5050 are closer to the $300 range. Any current gen GPU that you buy will run any game.. it just may not run it at max settings with super high fps. Even the cheapest amd/Nvidia GPU should run any game. I would probably get a GPU with at least 12gb of vram just to be safe.. but I think they have mostly done away with 12gb variants so you may have to go to 16gb.  Hell, you could get a 9800x3D and run the integrated graphics on it and that will run most games.. just maybe not with great fps or quality. I know cs2 for example, you can get almost 60 fps with the 9800x3D integrated graphics.. but on more demanding games like cyberpunk you are looking at single digits of fps. Still get a dedicated GPU.. I was just making a broader point of how much things have changed.  Personal take: I cannot stand Nvidia/GeForce experience. I will fully admit that I have had instability problems with my 7900xtx drivers with the AM5 platform but I will take that any day over GeForce experience. Never had a stability issue on AM4. I chose a 7900XTX over a 4090 for that specific reason. For anyone curious, my 7900XTX is a high bin card which I did benchmarking with to compare to my friends 4090 FE. Timespy score was basically the same.. although his GPU specific score was roughly 12% higher. I can post the benchmarks if anyone wants  TLDR; if you are going to overspend on anything, get the 9800x3D... 7800x3D if you need to save some cash.. it's still an amazing CPU. Get a dedicated GPU with at least 12gb of vram. If you need a hard budget, an 8gb budget card can get you by. The only reason I suggest 12 or more is so you have more options for higher end games or higher resolution monitors.. plus 12gb+ of vram will age a bit better than 8.",Positive

AMD,"Intel CPUs fell off massively, latest generations (13/14) can basically brick themselves because they can deliver unsafe voltages to themselves. This has also been degrading their performance over time, something I’ve seen a lot in practice.   Nvidia has a similar issue with its GPUs where their higher end ones can literally set themselves on fire because the cables meant to power them aren’t prepared for this poorly designed behemoth demanding the same amount of power as your standard microwave. The mid-range and baseline models have had poor releases with insufficient VRAM for modern badly optimised games, which is what your average consumer needs a dedicated GPU for.

They were released the same time when Intel tried introducing high performing cores and low performing cores.  Basically AMD created great products at the same time Intel made slightly worse and more pricey.   Also AMD was the default for some PC builders even back then because of the price/value ratio. I also could OC without buying a specialized OC processor when Intel OC was heavily locked.   During AM2/3 generation there were CPUs that were released as dual core and you could unlock 2 extra cores. Basically it was a risk because those cores might be unstable but for me it worked as well.   That was very back then.

AMD,"AMD and Nvidia graphics cards are both good when talking about current gen AMD graphics cards, and Nvidia is still typically more popular, though discrete AMD graphics cards have been selling unusually well this generation. Pricing has fluctuated a lot this generation too, with prices and availability being quite poor earlier this year when the new products first launched, but with prices going to MSRP or even below for a few months at the end of last year. Prices are now rising quite rapidly again, so I would not wait too long before getting something. Generally speaking, models with 16GB of vram have been the best value options, IF you can afford them. With what's happening with prices currently, the RTX 5070 might also be worth considering. It doesn't have a lot of vram for the price, but if it's one of the only cards still available for MSRP, it might be a good value.   Assuming MSRP pricing, or pricing that's equally proportional to MSRP pricing (with all cards being an equal percentage above MSRP), the 9060 XT (16GB), 5060 ti (16GB), RX 9070, RX 9070 XT, and RTX 5070 ti are all good options at each respective price point.   Gigabyte cards have had issues with ""thermal gel migration"". This might only be affecting cards which aren't mounted in a horizontal orientation. Gigabyte is apparently starting to use a different type of compound to correct this issue going forward, but most cards on store shelves currently likely still have the problematic thermal gel. If components start running too hot because the thermal gel is no longer providing adequate contact with some components, the warranty should cover a fix for this.   If you're concerned, you could monitor temperatures for things like memory, and see if any of those temps ever starts going a lot higher. You could then inspect the card to see if the thermal gel is sliding out of position.",Positive
AMD,"For CPU yes, AMD is now better in pretty much every way. The new intel CPUs are better for productivity in some workload (but not all), but they are all worst for gaming. AMD has the best gaming CPUs (the x3d models) and still dominating many productivity workload as well.  GPU is debatable. AMD definitely has the better value, but for top tier performance Nvidia is still king (but more expansive). AMD's best GPU is about on par with Nvidia's 5070ti (5070ti is usually a little bit better, but not on all game, it does raytracing better and supports DLSS, but it's also more expensive. You could go one or the other depending on pri e and availability and have very similar performance). AMD doesn't have anything that compares to a 5080 or 5090 (but those are very expensive).  Depending on budget and availability, for a top tier gaming experience without spending an insane amount of money I feel like 5800x3d + 32GB of RAM and either a 9070XT or 5070ti is where it’s at right now. Get a decent 1440p monitor and you'll be set for years to come.",Positive

AMD,"For gaming it really depends....at 4k any processor will do just fine. In fact m, if we're not talking about the 3d varrient of the ryzen processor the higher clock speeds of an Intel chip would provide pretty good 1% lows while offering more cores for productivity.  The meta strictly for gaming, however, are 3d ryzen varrients. Their cash, efficiency, and to some extent price makes them pretty attractive.   My advice is to find the best deal on a processor that can support your gpu the best and then take that money and get a better GPU or monitor.  For example a core 5 ultra (which offers 10-15% more processing power) goes for around 2-250. The 9800x3d goes for 400-450. That 200$ difference in purchasing a gpu might make a bigger difference in gaming performance than going with a ryzen chip.",Positive

AMD has better price to performance but their highest end card this generation doesnt even approach nvidia. cant really go wrong with either though as long as you do your research, and with nvidia potentially putting cards that are barely a year old into EoL due to ram shortages, AMD is looking more and more like the better option every day.",Positive

AMD,I switched to AMD with the first ryzen series and haven’t seen intel do anything but play catch up since then. If it weren’t for AMD ryzen (and the even more powerful threadripper) we’d be lucky to have CPUs with more than 4 physical cores in anything but the most expensive intel extreme cpus. But once AMD started making low price 6 and 8 core processors intel finally added more. Plus the cpu cache.

Even worked for an Intel joint venture for a number of years and was loyal.   Times have changed. My most recent build is AMD and it has been solid. Intel lost its way, started playing marketing, lost its engineering skill and talent. Was lead by the business sure, not the technical pioneers that made them the powerhouse they were.

Their new GPU’s are cool and affordable, but CPU’s are just underwhelming in comparison. AMD’s more or less accomplished exponential leaps and gains in the last few years.   I currently have a 13700k, and the issues that came with the gen feel like they’ve been resolved with the  updates (and it seems to run a whole lot better on w11 than w10), but I always regret not doing more research when I did my build and going AMD.

AMD,"GPU  is still a war between Nvidia and AMD for the most part. But the choice boils down to preference and affordability at this point. Nvidia's GPUs are better for productivity, which your son probably doesn't need, and also it is smart of him to go with AMD GPU instead since they offer better price-performance ratio. Even then AMD GPUs are quickly catching up on productivity as well, something like streaming, so even if you son wants to stream, he can still get pretty good stream quality with the 9000 series of AMD GPUs.  CPU wise, it's a no brainer to go with AMD, since they offer insane upgradability. The AMD motherboards pretty much let you upgrade to the maximum performing CPU you can get, as long as the CPU uses the same socket. Intel and AMD CPU's in the same tier pretty much trade blows with each other the same tier, but usually Intel CPUs are more expensive than AMD when you compare the price-peformance value, so again, it makes no sense to go with Intel based on the comparison.

For a gaming box, new, even if you plan to go with Windows right now, thinking about Linux compatibility wouldn't be a bad idea. Nvidia has their own sets of software features that either just they have, or that they do better than AMD, while AMD tends to offer a bit better value in terms of basic performance per dollar. There are pros and cons to both. Then, if you're squeezing nickels (RIP penny) in this market, there's even Intel!  While there are many fanboys willing to make excuses, Nvidias drivers haven't any kind of gold standard since we were all running 2k/XP. AMD has had perfectly fine drivers for a good while now, like 10-15 years, except for during the first few weeks after a new launch, on Windows, and a few months, on Linux (there's a lot more goin on in Linux, than just having a new driver package to download). Nvidia does do better at making their release drivers good.  CPU-wise, Intel has been playing catchup, then had a bad time with 13th and 14th gen. There has been some evidence that their fix just got the CPU degradation slow enough to get through the warranty period, too. The latest couple designs of theirs have been very good (Arrow Lake (+refresh), and Twin Lake/Lunar Lake, specifically), but they not quite topping the gaming charts, on average.  Meanwhile, since Su became CEO, AMD hasn't missed a beat, with the Ryzens. Every gen has offered at least a typical 10% uplift, at similar power to the prior gens, and offer better average gaming performance than Intel, at most price points. Zen and Zen+ were a little dodgy, but stability and reliability has been excellent, since Zen 2 and the 2nd gen of motherboard designs (many of the first-gen Ryzen boards were rushed, lazy, cheap, designs, since nobody expected AMD's new CPUs to do any better than their last 5 or 6). There also are no third-party chipsets, anymore, which mostly solved that ages-old AMD instability reputation. Then, for chart topping halo products, the X3D CPUs kick ass and take names, with ~100MB last-level cache.  At home, everything but my laptop is now Ryzen, including my home servers; and my work laptop is a Ryzen. Aside from IOMMU group annoyances (if you don't know what that means, it will never affect you), which is a trade off for an affordable low power ECC-supporting platform, they're all rock solid, and do more than I need them to.",Neutral

But if Valve releases SteamOS in some way, then I'm 100% buying an AMD GPU to install it (Assuming I don't just get a Steam Machine and sell the PC - I *really* hate Windows, and it's the main thing putting me off my PC right now).",Positive
AMD,"Don't  side Intel right away, depending on the prices at the moment of DDR5 and rising prices of some AM4 CPUS, depending on the budget and  system purposes, the Intel i5 14600K (5 year warranty) with a socket 1700  DDR4 board is a very interesting option for gaming",Positive
AMD,I use all AMD and no regrets.,Neutral
AMD,"In simple terms, Intel turned away from gamers to do corporate focused hardware. AMD turned the other way, with their x3D chips made spesificly for gamers. Again Nvidia wants their cards to be AI picture generators basicly render 2 real game frames and putting 4 fake frames in between them smoothing out the difference. Although this works most of the time there are issues with it. AMD however just raw dogs it. They might only do 4 frames for Nvidias 5 but they are all real game frames. The wildcard here is newcommer in the GPU market... Intel, while in its infancy stage they are moving forward at a breakneck speed selling cheap GPUs with some actual ""umph"" behind them",Neutral
AMD,"for now. Those old enough to remember the start of the blue vs red team war knows this is just one more battle done with the war still on going.  They have always flopped back and fourth over the years. Sometimes intel will sit on top for 5-10 years cause they are riding on the laurels of some great tech that stomped AMD, sometimes its AMD doing the riding.   Either way its a back and forth as each company tries to reclaim their spot after the other makes some ground breaking tech move, or one makes a massive mistake with a product like Bulldozer or 13/14th gen intels for example.  with nvidia, amd has always been slightly behind but way better cost. their biggest killer was shitty drivers for years. now they too are neck and neck in the fight, slightly winnning depending how you view the value per dollar aspect on features.",Neutral
AMD,"I always choose AMD for value, after Ryzen debuted many of the chips are better,  and the value is still better.  Additionally even if there are various Intel chips that are better the difference is no longer significant enough to bother.",Positive
AMD,"Yes and it has been for several years now. Amd really stepped up their game for home consumers/gamers and started tailoring cpus to this demographic which has led them to be able to offer more bang for the buck. Dollar for dollar, amd cpus are better value performers.  Intel has continued to make great products but they are designed more for workhorse stations and these benefits don't translate as well for gamers.",Positive
AMD,"honestly, I've been with AMD building PC's for decades now.   (i even used Cyrix CPU's back in the day)   Intel was always what we used at work on servers and such.   I used AMD on GPU's mostly because Intel did not bother.",Neutral
AMD,"For cpu sure but nvidia is still the stronger option for overall features and performance.  AMD only competes in the midrange and is lacking on some of the qol features nvidia has.  Intel’s current gen is hardly competitive with AMD for price, performance, and compatibility.  The X3D series from AMD is solidly at the top for gaming performance.",Neutral
AMD,Where have you been for the last 5 years?,Neutral
AMD,"AMD has been the standard for *at least* the past 5 years.  Long story short, Intel was the best, then got lazy for a decade doing nothing new. At the same time, AMD took a massive financial gamble that paid off on a swap to ""chiplet"" designs, allowing for drastically greater yields and greater modular control of the CPUs they make. This allowed AMD to leapfrog past the complacent Intel, and Intel still hasn't recovered.  as for GPUs, nvidia is still considered ""better"" in terms of raw power and raytracing, but AMD is almost universally the better deal even before Nvidia went all in on AI datacenters. Nvidia was only really worthwhile if you absolutely needed the best raytracing or couldn't handle having only the second best GPU.",Positive
AMD,"I used to be Intel/Nvidia for a long time as well, but switched to all AMD 5 years ago. That's when AMD started to become real good. For CPU's I think they're clearly the best choice, for GPU's they're the best performance for your money.",Positive
AMD,Yes AMD is the new standard. Intel’s founders either retired or were pushed out by the board. Like Boeing the business executives didn’t emphasize technical excellence and with time Intel has fallen behind. AMD’s founders are also gone but after a few so so leaders Lisa Su has proven to be a great leader on both the technical and business executive fronts.,Negative
AMD,"Bear in mind that AMD gpu don't work well with sole glass textures with the creation engine, if he's planning to play a lot of Fallout 4 go for a Nvidia",Neutral
AMD,"Intel mucked it up after 12th gen. Increasing power draw for lessening performance gains, then the degradation and stability issues hit. Company went through a bad moment and had to raise prices, so the newer chips aren't exactly good value either.  Meanwhile AMD went on to make their CPUs a lot more power efficient and introduced large L3 cache to consumer chips (a concept first developed by Intel in the 5th gen, for iGPUs), making them the prime choice for gaming.  Intel still has its place on workstation builds due to the better all-core performance on most of their CPUs and the integrated graphics video transcoding and AMD still has issues such as the fragility of the 3D V-cache and the poor memory controller.",Negative
AMD,I remember when the intel Core 2 Quads came out and was like the gold standard for cpus. How the mighty has fallen,Neutral
AMD,"Intel's been out of the game for a while, it just goes in prebuilt pc's.",Neutral
AMD,"It depends.   Different target market segments.   Intel hasn't gone anywhere,  they're doing great and doing what Nvidia is doing and making most of their money selling enterprise equipment to enterprises.  AMD sells ""Gaming"" stuff, so you hear about it more in spaces like this where 95%+ of the people are average consumers buying stuff for their one gaming pc.   Both have their pros and cons.  I built a new enterprise class workstation last year using Intel Xeons and the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96GB and its performance and stability is unquestionable for the AI work I do.  I could not do the work I do as easily and quickly with an AMD GPU.  If all you do with your GPU is play games, AMD is totally fine and cheaper.   It's just different market segments and use case scenarios.  You and your 12 year old are probably right within AMDs target market segment, so of course it's his first choice.",Positive
AMD,"There is basically no reason to buy an intel CPU for gaming. Upgradeability, price, performance, efficiency, stability, AMD is better on all fronts. For GPU Nvidia is a borderline monopoly, but AMD is better price to performance for pure gaming performance.",Positive

AMD,"Intel seems to be the standard for Industry/Enterprise devices now mostly, while AMD is because the top choice for commercial use",Neutral
AMD,"amd has been killing for it for the last 5 years  am4 platform lasted over 9 years and is still supported, people are still upgrading their systems from 9 years ago, same mobo and ram with a simple bios update  am5 is doing the same, one platforms and multiple upgrades  steam shows they are killing it too, intel is a dinosaur",Positive
AMD,"for CPUs, right now AMD isnt just killing it, they are goddamned crushing it. Ever since the first Ryzen refresh, AMD has been showing Intel how its done, and supporting the sockets for these bitchin' chips far longer than any intel socket that I'm aware of. you can get a first generation AM4 board and throw a 5950x in there and as long as the bios is up to date, its probably going to work. possibly not at its best, but it should work (unless the maker never made a bios update for new chips) and that kind of upgradability cannot be ignored.     GPU wise, they have for quite a time been the value leader. and that still is true today. Nvidia has the top end cornered but everything below the very top, AMD has a better priced answer (normally)",Positive
AMD,"For gpu edge to Nvidia but AMD is more price competitive. In either case, avoid 8gb cards and go with 16gb.",Neutral
AMD,Inter was underperforming for many years to then horribly fuck up 13th and 14th gen with hardware destroying bugs to then rename their entire CPU lineup for no fucking reason to make everyone very confused FOR NO REASON    They're completely fucked for the foreseeable future,Negative
AMD,"Mu views are different.   AMD GPUs are a poor man's choice. Everything is less, not as fast and the (software); quality is not good enough. In my view for GPU's  there is no Nvidia tax: there is only an AMD discount.     For CPU's: yes AMD is faster. They also selfdestruct (9800x3D), have a worse memory controller across the board, after several generations still have USB issues, still have PCIe bugs, provide not enough PCIe lanes and after all the shit I experienced I don't trust any AGESA release. And lets not forget AMD designs are missing several modern features like CUDIMM support and an NPU.   So i took the lower (in select games) performance for granted and am very happy with Intel again.",Negative

AMD,"It's 50/50 which one is the biggest liability any year. Amd is popular in gaming right now, Intel is preferred in servers and businesses.",Neutral
AMD,"I went with Intel 12th gen when I built my PC because it had the good value over similar AMD processors at the time (for example 12400 vs 5600).

AMD,AMD is the default choice for GPU?   Lol their 7% market share says otherwise.,Neutral
AMD,"Intel shit the bed, so the standard is now Ryzen CPU for PC gaming.  Intel started falling out of favour around 10 years ago, and in the last 5 things have gone badly for them in the desktop PC space.  Intel ensure the chipsets and physical sockets on the motherboards are made obsolete after single generations, so upgrading often means a new board, however the AM4 platform for AMD means someone can still do a CPU upgrade on their system easily 3-5 years down the line if they aren't interested in DDR5 and a higher tier of PCIE.  Intel 14-15gen CPU's also started dying due to overvolting settings on motherboards, and there was a security issue (Meltdown and Spectre) that had to be patched and dropped the performance of some chips.  I believe AMD might have also had this issue as well, but there was a big focus on Intel's Enterprise stuff being impacted pretty negatively.",Negative
AMD,"Last gen (7000), I built a new computer with a gigabyte mb, amd processor and gpu. Not looking back. Happy with my build.",Positive
AMD,Guess the new intel chips are going to take back the crown. Heard the ones comming out next are supposed to put amd back to playing catch up. We shall see and just better for the consumers when we have both competing especially now with all the ai crap taking up memory and raising prices on everything.,Neutral
AMD,Amd actually innovated and made massive improvements to the speed and amount of physical cores of their CPUs while intel has been stagnant with minimal improvements for several years now and the most recent intel cpu line has a habit of nuking itself. When it comes to graphic cards amd and nvidia are pretty comparable however that will change in the next year or so as nvidia is downsizing ther graphic card division in favor of ai while amd as far as i am aware has no plans on downsizing so will take over the gpu market.,Neutral
AMD,AMD has been the standard for CPU since 5800x3D and I’d argue started turning into the standard at the 3000 series.,Neutral

You just pay a premium for it. Nvidia is still very relevant, unlike Intel.",Neutral

They are better for Linux, but otherwise I think they are terrible choices (as an unfortunate owner of a 7900XTX who wishes they brought a 4080 Super). If your son really wants it though, GIGABYTE aren’t really that good. Better options are XFX or Sapphire.",Negative

AMD,"Ever since AMD released their Ryzen series CPU's, they took over the market and have been dominating ever since.  As for Video cards, Nvidia is still considered the best right now, having over 90% of the market share, but AMD has been catching up this GPU release with a few competitive models.  There's been strong influencer hype and push for AMD this generation for GPU's but they aren't there yet in terms of quality and performance, but either way a 9070/9070 XT and 9060/9060XT are strong condensers for a GPU this time from AMD.  As for Gigabyte, I would suggest against purchasing their GPU's this generation since they have been doing some experimentation with new gel putty instead of thermal paste for their GPU's and there have been issues with it leaking.",Positive
AMD,"actually Intel just woke up, & came up full force with renewed energy (Panther Lake line up), after getting new CEO",Positive
AMD,I'd say no. Reddit and YT are just filled to the brim with AMD shills. Intel is still a great choice for an allrounder.,Positive
AMD,"I saw so many AMD fanboys bullshitting even in pre-Ryzen days, so I would take all of these comments with a grain of salt. It's true that AMD started to have an edge after Ryzen, but I bet even now their differences isn't really all that far apart. And from my experience it was always my friends with AMD who had issues.  GPU is a bit different problem, but head to head AMD can't compete at all. It's just that NVIDIA decided to go all in on AI, so their price these days are all over the place. So maybe these days AMD is the better performance per buck but if the AI hype dies down, probably not so much.   Then again, it's been years since I built any PCs so maybe I'm just outdated.

AMD,It flipped with ryzen 3000,Neutral
AMD,"Well, Intel thought nobody could catch them, so they endlessly sold the same processors with tiny improvements to a market with no competition, and then AMD had their miracle moment with Ryzen, and Intel couldn't innovate fast enough to keep their brand image and monopoly on X86 intact.  AMD also priced more aggressively, supports sockets and chipsets for longer, and gave people things that Intel redused to until it was too late.",Neutral

AMD,If your doing mid range/budget any is fine if you want top of the line amd cpu nvidia gpu,Neutral
AMD,"AMD for CPU. Intel sat on its market share by increasing price and barely giving improvements from generation to generation. AMD came swinging with Ryzen, which was faster, cheaper, and stable (unlike previous AMD CPUs). Then Intel's 13th and 14th gen CPUs were melting themselves. Intel is now playing catch up as AMD takes more and more of the market.  Argument could be made for either as a GPU. Definitely not a straight ""Go Nvidia"" like 5-10 years ago.

I can maybe see using the Ultra line? But still, the heat is such an issue that it only makes sense if you need really high core counts for niche workloads.   In the PC gaming world, AMD is now the choice of anybody who really knows what they’re doing. At the cost of MUH ULTRA REALISTIC RAY TRACING!!! and DLSS 4.0, you can get far better price to performance with an AMD gpu.

Updated the BIOS right after getting it and now did one more BIOS update recently. This new CPU didn't cause me any problems at all and it's still a beast and overkill for many tasks.

No regrets on this build at all (besides going 64GB DDR5-6400 CL32 instead of something like 48GB DDR5-8200 CL38).  With the 265K costing more now than it did when I was building and RAM prices being crazy (and especially with wanting low-latency DDR5 6400+ for an LGA1851 build), I'm not sure the value is still there right now.

Bulldozer was an awesome bang for buck for low end systems, especially if you cared about more than just gaming performance.    In 2012 I bought an 8 core CPU for less than the price of an i3.    The mobo was cheaper and that allowed me to buy 32GB of ram for less than a dual core 8GB of ram intel system would have cost.

Of course the difference was small, so it was almost always better to get the X800 or X900/X950 model of AMD instead of the 1X900K (10900K was the last good price/performance advantage Intel had) but they weren't actually consistently *better* until the 7800X3D vs the 14900K.",Positive

If they hold up as they are reported to, they will give x3D chips a run for their money. Even though I haven't been the biggest fan of Intel the past few years, I'm looking forward to seeing what the next gen 18A chips bring to the table. I'm hoping that panther lake + their memory controllers really leap forward in terms of platform stability with DDR5.. because with AM5, DDR5 is a joke  I would have never swapped to AM5 if I could have gotten a 5800x3D for even a remotely decent price.

AMD,"Yeah the 3d VCache in cpus for gaming really changed things.  It's not revolutionary in every game, but if your game has high cpu loads at all an x3d processor is a huge boost.",Positive
AMD,"For gaming *in specific configurations*. Most mid-high end CPUs will provide similar gaming performance if you have a lower-end (or even mid-range) GPU, or a high resolution (4k, 2.5k UW, etc). The X3Ds really come into their own with a high-end GPU (5080, 4090, 5090, etc) or when gaming at 1080p.   For most people, the difference between an X3D and non-X3D CPU is not nearly as much as what the benchmarks show, because most people are GPU-bound most of the time in games. There's a reason all the gaming CPU benchmarks use an RTX 5090 and 1080p. That way the game is heavily CPU bound and so the differences between CPUs becomes stark. (I say most because there are some games that rely more heavily on the CPU.)  Also, you'd want to compare the 7600X3D to something like a 14600k and not a 14900k. For gaming, the 14600k, 14700k, and 14900k generally are similar.",Neutral
AMD,>For gaming though a 7600x3d gives better performance than the 14900k at half the price  That's only half true. The 7600X3D does not give better performance than the 14900K. It does come pretty close (14900K is usually 5 to 10% faster).  I would definitely buy a 7600X3D over a 14900K unless I was already locked into LGA1700 or really loved DDR4 RAM.,Neutral

When I was deciding between nvidia and AMD, I chose an AMD 7900xt because its raster performance was about 1/3 higher the similar priced Nvidia card.  But for most people I would have chose nvidia.  It all depends on your use case.  Now, either is pretty similar performance overall at the mid to upper mid range, though if you want path tracing, nvidia is still the best choice.",Neutral
AMD,Sure but you're describing like over 90% of consumers,Neutral
AMD,"True, but the gap isn't that big, honestly, and mostly in the realm of extremes.   The main thing, though, is that card costs more than the entire rest of my computer. Including several generations of upgrades and every component I've ever had in it for the past many years. Sure, it'll sit in the back of my mind on a ""some day, if I manage to become super rich, I'll get a x090 for my computer, but until then, I'm not even going to bother looking at pricetags for it.""  It's like talking about what kind of car I'm going to buy for daily driving and someone pointing out that a Bugatti will outperform the other ones I'm considering. Which sure, that's true.

AMD,"Similar boat - I built my PC back in May, and at the time it was mostly going to be running a Plex server on Unraid. But I knew I wanted to game at some point, so I wanted to get a *decent enough* foundation. Intel offered more cores and an integrated GPU, which was better for Plex, so I ended up going with a 12700K. It was the cheapest bundle MicroCenter offered at the time - I think it was $319 for the CPU, mobo, and 16GB of DDR4 (which I ended up replacing with 32GB a little later).   Finally got around to throwing a 5070Ti in there about a month ago, and it’s been a beast! 4K on Ultra settings and it’s pegged at 60fps, which is fine for me since that what my monitor caps out at 😂😭  I’m sure things would be different if I was trying to target higher fps and/or lower resolution, but it’s been absolutely fine for me. I haven’t seen my CPU above 50% usage while gaming, and the extra cores have been a godsend for Plex.  Edit: I was way wrong on price! The bundle was $319, not $429.",Positive

AMD,Around 12y ago AMD was struggling to release any good CPU and ARM wasn't a threat so Intel had free rein over the market. At the time Intel Execs felt it was smart to massively cut into their R&D budget.  Back then a lot of experts saw it as a really bad move long term in an industry where you can't afford to sleep on things. Warned that it would cost Intel dearly in the next 5 to 10 years and that's basically what happened.   For GPU the current situation is more due to the mess caused by crypto and now AI which allow NVIDIA to focus on it without a care for consumer products pricing causing them to jump to stupid levels over the last 6 years.,Negative

There can be advantages going with either Windows or Mac ARM. You would know them if you needed them. There are more disadvantages to doing so and you ain't realise them until it's too late.

Its not that they're worthless, but if im building something I intend to use for a long time then ryzen is simply the way to go.   For gpus, if money is no object, nvidia is still king. But if you are only looking to spend $400-$600, then go amd. I highly recommend the 9070XT in that price range. Again, for budget builds, Intel gpus aren't bad. Their drivers are catching up since they're late in the space, but they can play pretty much any of the popular / modern games as long as the hardware can run it. I personally run a 6750 XT rn but im going to upgrade in probably a year or two and finally make the leap into 1440p gaming.   For cases I highly recommend Fractal and Lian Li builds.

AMD,"From what I know intel technically still has better single threat performance, but that's been kind of irrelevant for a long time now as most applications are at least somewhat threaded.   Even in games that are single thread it's not like you'd notice the difference nowadays, especially since most of that would be older games.  As for GPU, part of the push for AMD cards is from the Linux community as they perform as well if not better on Linux than Windows.  Nvidia can have performance issues in Linux because they are still doing their proprietary BS, where AMD actually helps with the open source MESA drivers. Also, Nvidia is basically abandoning the consumer market in favor of all the AI BS.",Neutral

Framework I think also sells a specific AMD chip that uses unified RAM memory that is somewhat interesting and wasn’t available in a desktop like form factor for regular people from what I remember. Other than this I would say it’s still AMD and Intel as the main things available that are actually useful and performant for people building regular computers.

Ofc, but when we're talking about value from a holistic perspective, Nvidia easily beats AMD. The biggest reason reddit tends to hate on Nvidia is because their cards are not cheap enough, not because they're not the best. Features and driver support are still AMD's bane (see FSR4), and don't get me started on VR support (or lack thereof).  Since the 1080ti, their cards have consistently paid for themselves. I've yet to spend any more than a dollar to upgrade to the latest and greatest high-end card. Although, this time around I purposely chose to skip out on the 5090 since I was content with my 4090 and 7800x3d build, even though I could've upgraded for free (I don't game as much now).  CUDA, NVEC AV1, and plenty of other prosumer features (Nvidia Surround and Broadcast) are why I'll continue spending a little extra for their cards. I say this knowing not everyone can easily buy/find their cards.",Negative
AMD,2000 series has access to the same dlss-sr presets as the newest cards just 20/30 series will run the most recent ones just released significantly worse than 40/50. so most users of the older cards will likely stick to the dlss presets released 1 year ago which are still very solid visually but quite worse when it comes to ghosting. it is still great that they have access to those new presets though and they're leaving the option up to the user since in some games you might have the overhead or want to compare if it's worth the tradeoff.   fsr 4 is only on the 90 series at the moment. an int8 version which is able to be run on all rdna 2/3 and nvidia cards leaked several months ago and people have been able to use it unofficially through optiscaler by taking dlss inputs which are implemented in pretty much every game and then using fsr 4 as the output. it works well i've used it on steam deck personally just to mess with it. someone who wants a seamless experience prob shouldn't get amd at the moment if they want fsr 4 in everything but if they're cool with dragging some files it's very simple.,Neutral
AMD,">but aren't old Nvidia GPUs stuck on old DLSS versions?  No, the 2000 series and up all support DLSS4, which is objectively the best implementation bar DLSS3 since it uses the transformer model instead of the older cnn.  The same can't be said about Radeon cards from the same era. FSR3 isn't as good as DLSS4 and it's even worse on older Radeon cards since most of them lack the hardware implementation Nvidia has had in their cards. FSR4, as it stands, is currently MIA from anything other than RDNA4.  So, seeing as how FSR4 is meant to compete directly with DLSS4 when we're now already onto DLSS4.5 (3000 series & up), I don't see how AMD is more backwards compatible than Nvidia. Also, consider that even DLSS3 still outperforms FSR3. That plus the lack of game dev support for FSR in many titles is why I wouldn't recommend Radeon (VR too).",Neutral

And they were often ahead perf wise most of the time... Like, Intel cheated in tons of ways like *literally* creating the major CPU benchmarks of the early 2000s that produced scores and tweaked the scoring algos to benefit intel chips at the expense of AMD ones, ICC was used to purposefully harm both intel chips (p4 was so bad, they nerfed the p3 in the ICC to make benches make the p4 look attractive enough to buy) but also especially AMD chips so benches looked way worse than your software would run because intel spent a lot of effort making benching software universally use the ICC and not MSVC compiler by claiming it was the most optimized possible (and most normal software you ran was compiled with the msvc, including games...) and lots of other dirty tricks like making OEMs so dependant on cheap worse performing intel chips that they couldnt even take free AMD chips to put into OEM machines.  Intel has never actually been that good a company, never really had that much of a perf lead as people assumed, and has often been the butt of SERIOUS security and stability problems (FDIV bug, spectre/meltdown hitting so much harder and causing massive perf losses putting them worse than post mitigation AMD chips when then initially benched ahead, etc etc).

By newest you mean DLSS4.5, a solution AMD still hasn't responded to. DLSS4 works well on older cards since it uses the newer more efficient Transformer model instead of CNN. FSR4 is supposed to be AMD's answer to DLSS4 and in some ways DLSS3 too. But the fact it's not supported on anything other than RDNA4 is a weaker show (meaning it's more hardware dependent like DLSS).  Also, it's not like FSR3 works well on hardware it's meant to support, especially when compared to the older DLSS3.

Almost exactly 5 years later for me and I have no urge to upgrade, which is unusual.  This PC does everything for me, gaming, running VM's, I keep so much stuff open (like 100+ tabs in my browser) etc.    Not sure what changed between this build and previous builds, but I feel like the lifespan of gaming PC's has been extended in the past few years.  Maybe we are reaching a limit of FPS/resolution so there's not a big need to do major upgrades as often?     Not sure what it is.

The 5070Ti *barely* kept up with the 12700K, and in many cases it was actually slower.   Right now, my gaming PC and media server are the same computer (I need to shut down Unraid, and boot back into Windows when I want to game). I’m probably going to “split them” soon, and build a new PC for the server and keep the current PC for gaming.   I *could* keep the current PC for Plex and build a new AMD PC for gaming…but I already have the old 16GB of DDR4 laying in a drawer and the gaming performance is fine for me.

The results have been a total disaster, only saved by their ability to produce more of the smaller x86 CPUs than AMD can. Over the next couple years, they're planning to make Xeons that are more or less chiplet-based, and like Lunar Lake and Twin Lake, have high core count models made with just the souped-up newer E-cores.

It's one of the best upgrades you can make on an AM4 motherboard without changing platforms.  To pair it well, the sweet spot would be something like an RTX 3060 Ti / 3070 / 4060 Ti or, on the AMD side, an RX 6700 XT / 6800. Below that, the CPU's potential is somewhat underutilized; above that, it depends on resolution and budget.  If you're also using Linux, AMD tends to have more plug-and-play drivers.

AMD,"I'm being overly pedantic here. It's not really the ""brand"" that you should concern yourself with. ASRock is the brand. It has a variety of hardware tiers like most other brands.  That being said, you're budget shopping. So you're in a budget range. The question you have to ask is: what do you want out of your GPU?  I run AI image and video generation. So there are times when my GPU temps go wild. Which means that I need the right kind of hardware to tolerate temperature spikes consistently and long enough. This requires better architecture, cooling and materials to that end. So I got a ""higher end"" GPU.  If you're not stressing a PC and just regularly gaming, a Steel Legend, for example, is perfectly fine. It might be a little noisier. It might run slightly hotter.

My son has a prebuilt with the steel legend version in it...again no issues.   If you're not planning to overclock, it doesn't matter unless sound is your most important metric.  In which case the more robust cooling solution will typically be quieter.   When I'm gaming I have my headset on, and my pc is a few feet away so that's not really a concern for me.",Neutral
AMD,"The higher tier cards have higher margins. Why? Because they add on extra features that cost almost nothing and charge tons of money for them.  There is almost no reason to spend extra. None of the cards are binned, the performance difference between cards is 100% due to power targets and factory OC settings. The only thing measurable difference is going to be the temperature and noise. Temperature does not matter at all because all the cards can be configured to be at the same sound level, so the real difference is sound/noise levels.",Negative
AMD,"Just grab the Pulse tbh.  Unless you want the american muscle car equivalent aka the Mercury OC, loud n proud",Neutral
AMD,"Depends on what you care about.  Performance? Negligible difference.  Sound levels? The cooling solution does make a difference here. There are cards with better fans that run quieter.  Warranty/Customer Service? Some companies are a lot better than others. Both Sapphire and XFX are preferred because of their better customer service and warranty handling.  So you aren't going to get a card that gives you more FPS, but it might not make as much noise. Plus if you get unlucky and your card dies some companies will treat you better. For example Asus is infamous for their terrible warranty support to the point where it is probably illegal. They'll claim you have to pay to have your GPU repaired because there is a tiny scratch on the plastic.  For AMD GPUs Sapphire and XFX should be your first choices, specifically because they generally treat their customers well. With EVGA out of the Nvidia GPU space, Nvidia customers wish these companies made Nvidia cards.  Asus should always be your last choice, for every part they make, for how shitty their warranty service is. AS Rock in the GPU space is mid tier, they haven't had any major screw ups in the GPU space and they have alright warranty support. Which is funny because they are owned by Asus.",Neutral

AMD,"That's part of what prompted the question. The Steel Legend looks to have a poorer build quality than some of the other cards, although that's to be expected with a lower priced model. That being said, the other cards at the same price point as the legend will probably be of similar build quality.",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t put too much stock into steel nomad, lots of the people running that benchmark are running fine tuned overclocks which skews the data further to the right in terms of performance. I would instead run some benchmarks on games you are actually playing and compare those to ones online. And your gpu power will be affected by cpu and ram so take that into consideration as well.",Neutral
AMD,"Perhaps ""brand"" was the wrong term. I couldn't think of the perfect term. Maybe simply ""card"" would have been more appropriate. That being said thanks for the correction.  As you say, I'll probably be using the card mostly for casual gaming at the end of the day. The Steel Legend is probably more than enough for my situation. It's just that when I see it being ranked at the lower end of 9070xt benchmarks, it makes me pause for thought.",Neutral
AMD,"I've done some research and the Steel Legend often runs hotter than other models at this price point. It seemingly performs worse than the other cards too (as much as 4% perhaps). However, it's kind of hard to conceptualise what a 4% difference in performance and a 5-6 degree difference in temperature actually looks like in practice, which led me to make the post.  I'll probably end up going with the Pulse as the thermals look better and Sapphire provide a better warranty.",Negative

AMD,The performance delta basically translates to single digit FPS differences in some games so it's not worth losing sleep over.  Core and Hotspot temps are typically fine on all models as well and it's the [memory temps](https://www.techspot.com/photos/article/3015-amd-radeon-9070-xt-roundup/#GPU-VRM-png) where you see bigger differences across models.

Usually when you see people suggest to spend a little more it's because they're at an awkward price point where spending let's  say 10% more gets you a ton more value long term (upgrade to AM5 over AM4/LGA 1700, 16B VRAM, much faster RAM - well, at least 2,5 months ago) that's sort of stuff.",Neutral

AMD,"That could definitely be part of it! I don’t use headphones and my case stays pretty quiet, that combined with the coil whine being juuuust the right pitch to cut through is probably why it’s so noticeable. I’m almost certain it’s coil whine, it doesn’t sound like fans. But it’s only on some games that I’ll hear the whine, other games won’t elicit it very much so it could just be how certain games utilize the card. Thanks for the reply!

I tried:   1- Reinstall Drivers and BIOS  2- To replace my PSU (1000W).   3- Re-seat everything and unplug, replug everything from the PSU  4- Reinstall Windows.   Nothing worked.  I put in my old 2070 again, and the problem stopped.  I RMAed the GPU, and once I got my new one, the problem has been resolved.  They could not replicate the problem when I sent it for the RMA, they were going to send me back the GPU that I sent but I insisted that my PC is now working fine with the 2070, and it wasn't with that GPU, and they eventually sent me a working GPU.",Negative
AMD,"Run a stresstest on the RAM, with AIDA64 for example. RAM running at higher than base speeds (so running with an XMP/EXPO) profile is still a bit finicky. Sometimes it will boot, but crash when put under load. Running a RAM only stresstest will let you confirm/deny this as the source of your problem.",Negative
AMD,what kind of psu? Everyone says failure but u could have a good unit that doesnt have enough power on the rails for specific part. Buddy of mine i play with would have pc crashes on intense games or if we turned his settings maxed. I asked him his power supply and looked it up and it was more than enough wattage but digging into the rails they didnt supply enough power. His gpu wanted over 300 watts and the rail only supplied a max of 280 or something so once the card was being pushed itd just shut down. May be a problem with u especially if its a prebuilt like his was,Negative
AMD,I had this problem a few years ago and it turned out to be the GPU instead of the PSU. Computer was fine until I played a game. It would run for about 15 minutes and then shutdown.,Negative
AMD,"Whats his RAM timings? those sticks are single rank (8gb, 16gb or 24gb per stick) or double rank (32gb or more per stick)? if they are double rank probably the CPU can't handle it, try lowering the speed to 5600 and see if it keep happening.  [9800X3D just supports 5600 on single rank and double rank](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/9000-series/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d.html), BUT... most people can run 6000 (sweet spot) stable using single rank sticks... double rank is just silicon lottery.  He should try to run a stability test of CPU+RAM like AIDA64 or OCCT to see if he is getting any errors.",Neutral
AMD,Anecdotal but I had a RMX1000 too and it failed after 8 months. Was playing on my TV before my computer just blacked out. I got the warranty replacement for it but it took a long time so I also splurged out on a 1600W PSU instead. I run 5090 + 9800x3d and do a lot of gen AI work.,Negative
AMD,either PSU or bad cpu chip whea errors or messed up ram timings,Negative
AMD,"You could check Event Viewer logs for any power/voltage related shutdowns, and can use HWInfo for example to monitor power outputs from the PSU. Not seeing any anomolies doesnt guarantee a good PSU, but this does not cost a lot of money or time to investigate.",Neutral
AMD,Clean it from dust.,Neutral
AMD,too hot maybe....  repaste cpu and gpu + undervolt/underclock your cpu/gpu/ram from bios + use power saver mode,Neutral
AMD,"My machine did this for a while and I had no idea why. I would start a high demanding game and the screen would freeze and then the pc would restart. I ended up cleaning the old thermal paste off the cpu, reseating the CPU fan with new thermal paste and did the same thing with my GPU. It restart or freeze ever again. Do that before you assume a part is broken.",Negative
AMD,If he’s replaced everything except GPU and RAM then one of those are likely the culprit. Can help rule out RAM by running Windows Memory Diagnostics tool. Try turning off XMP in bios.  Consider drivers as the issue. After fresh windows install only download essential software to test (like Steam).,Negative
AMD,Check wether you have 2 PCIe cables going on from your PSU to the GPU or only 1 with a double ending.,Neutral
AMD,"Out of curiosity, are you sure it's just the PC shutting off? Do you have anything else plugged into other nearby outlets that also turn off?  I say this because I used to have an issue where my window unit AC and PC were plugged into the same power circuit in my apartment. During the summer, when the AC was on and I was trying to play somewhat demanding games on my PC, they would try to pull too much power and trip my breaker.  You'd probably notice if you were tripping your breaker, but it's also possible there's problems with your electrical wiring. Perhaps try plugging the PC in to an outlet connected to a different circuit. Just throwing this out there as a (weird) possibility.",Neutral
AMD,When this happened to me it was one of my RAM sticks having an error but I also got a blue screen of death with each crash so that might not be your issue.,Negative
AMD,I had this problem and was stumped for weeks.  This video was exceptionally helpful and finally helped me identify the somewhat simple fix.  https://youtu.be/1EYLzD2GytA?si=PZXWA8aLthlVy828  It ended up being C-states,Positive
AMD,Try a new power cable for the GPU before replacing the PSU. Especially if there’s a sharp bend in the cable where it comes out of the GPU.,Neutral
AMD,look at your CPU temperature. Maybe you left the plastic protective film on the cooler.,Neutral
AMD,It can also be the RAM if the RAM is unstable. Try running without XMP/AMP turned on at stock ddr5 ram settings. Then try each RAM stick individually.,Neutral
AMD,"If all else fails, try disabling core integrity in windows security. This helped me in a similar situation after I went as far as replacing the PSU.",Neutral
AMD,"When you say it shuts down, do you mean it just cuts out and loses power as if the pug was pulled out the wall socket? If so I had that years ago. Tell him to take the GPU out and run with the integrated graphics on the CPU for a while. Won't be able to run a great deal but just play stuff it can handle. See if it keeps happening. When I had this I replaced the PSU first but it still happened. Took the GPU out for a few weeks and had no issues. Put a new GPU in and never had another problem. Cooling was not a problem, no overclocks either. Something on the GPU was causing power loss though.",Negative
AMD,"I just had this issue a few weeks ago, also with Expedition 33. Check the power cable going into the GPU. If, at the connector, it's bent too much the pins might not fully connect and you'll have power distributed unevenly - causing some pins to overheat. This will then cause the PSU to shut down if it believes your PC is overheating.   It took me awhile to figure it out but after taking off the side panel and readjusting the cable it has never done it again.   Of course, this is just a possibility but worth trying. Good luck!",Neutral
AMD,"When I had this issue, it was bad ram causing problems. You may want to look into testing it (each stick individually) to rule that out",Negative
AMD,"check for loose/missing connections on the mobo/gpu, try running with only one stick of ram, take a sniff from the PSU vent to see if something has been cookin' inside, google around how to disable all the power saving BS in windows, do away with all power saving shit in BIOS as well, start rolling back GPU drivers, check for known issues with your motherboard / BIOS but dont fuck around reflashing it unless you know what you're doing and you are aware of the risks, pay attention to hotspot temps while running a benchmark like heaven, dont really think event viewer will log an overheating core",Neutral
AMD,"Others are correct in pointing out a power supply issue.   One thing to also check is if your PC is hooked up to a UPS/APC. If it is, the fault may lie there.",Neutral
AMD,"Also check if your gpu fans are running. Had it not long ago they weren't, and learned that way a gpu can shut down your system as well if it is overheating.  For some stupid reason amd decided to set the fan curve to all 0's, and your description fits my experience",Negative
AMD,"I have the RM1000i not x, this exact problem happened to me when ever my psu switch from single 12v rail to multiple 12v rails, I solve it by switching back to single rail.   So from my experience it's 100% psu failing, rm1000 come with 10y, I recommend that you check your warranty and claim it.   *if you can get ""i"" it's my choice from corsair, and thier hx1000i shift is my next psu 😅",Negative
AMD,either psu or overheating problem,Negative
AMD,"PSU’s cooked probably. Had the same thing just happen to me, most of the same symptoms as you do",Negative
AMD,Is it only when playing games? Or will it shut down when idling in windows as well? I had a similar situation which drove me bonkers and I troubleshot for days with similar to what you are experiencing. Although mine restarted rather than just shut down.  It ended up being a faulty wire from my mobo to my pc case power button. It was tripping my system.   I ended up disconnecting and turned my pc on via the mobo power button (was in early stages of building a new pc to bother swapping out the wire),Negative
AMD,I had a similar issue here recently and it ended up being an alert set within iCUE. It was hard to find out what in event viewer other than it saying it triggered a shut down. But iCUE had an alert set to shutdown PC if it got to 50°. Turning that off fixed the issue.,Neutral
AMD,It's the PSU. I had the same thing happen where it would seem fine then shut down only on certain games. I tried diagnosing everything then just replaced my PSU and the problem went away completely.,Negative
AMD,"On top of what others have said with the PSU, sometimes a motherboard header can be over supplied. For example, you connected too many fans/RGB fans into a fan header without external supply to the PSU, this would cause games to crash too when power demand ramps up.",Negative
AMD,"Did he try updating his BIOS when he installed the 9070XT? I've encountered similar issues and the reason was outdated MB firmware, not (as I initially thought) the PSU!",Negative
AMD,had this on my pc (rx 6700xt) and my pc started having black screen while gaming with needing to restart everytime. i saw that recently there was increase of such things and what helped me was undervolting my gpu by a bit.,Negative
AMD,Had a problem like this. Tried a new psu.. Still the same. My problem was the sleeved 24pin cable was bad. Went back to my stock 24pin and no problems ever since,Negative
AMD,I had an issue where the AMD Adrenalin Software somehow became incompatible with the driver that was installed. Froze my computer and lost connection with my second monitor. Uninstalled and re-installed Adrenalin and everything was back to normal.,Negative
AMD,Sounds like overheating.  Remove and re-mount the CPU with new thermal paste?  Are all the case fans/CPU fan/GPU fan working correctly?,Neutral
AMD,Check temps. Get nzxt cam or something like that. It monitors you and cpu temps. If it's getting to hot it thermal throttles then shits down to prevent damage,Neutral
AMD,"Defective power supply is the most likely answer.   Defective motherboard is the second most likely.   CPU overheating and shutting down IS possible, but pretty unlikely (unless they're not using a cooler at all! Which, as I look at it... has OP stated which CPU cooler is actually being used?)",Neutral
AMD,This is also what happened to a friends PC when he needed to redo the thermal paste on his GPU. Everything was fine until there was demand on it.,Negative
AMD,Or a cooling issue. My PC shut down because my case fans weren't ramping up properly (incorrect settings in BIOS and it was like an oven in there. Must've been motherboard sensors triggering it because the CPU & GPU temps were in normal range.,Negative
AMD,"I had this exact same issue and replacing the psu resolved it. Old psu had plenty of power for the rig, but was just failing.",Negative
AMD,"I had the same exact issue with a Corsair PSU. My pc shut down randomly, usually during games. It also made a buzzing noise ever since I got it, probably indicated an issue already. I haven’t bought any Corsair hardware since, using a beQuiet PSU now.",Negative
AMD,"I am having the exact same issue as OP and I noticed it only happened while I had some stream going on my second monitor while gaming which leads me to believe it's a PSU issue. I replaced my motherboard first because it was having other issues and I thought perhaps it was related but at very worst I get a motherboard with working USB headers. It went away (or so it seemed) but then it happened 3 times in one night this last weekend while gaming and watching NFL on my second monitor.    My plan is to replace my PSU next week and just not have videos playing on my second monitor in the meantime. Everything on my PC has been replaced since this started happening except the PSU (through random upgrades like RAM, CPU, GPU etc).",Negative
AMD,"We already checked the outlet, and checked the power usage. But its still a concern.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, it never goes above 50 c° sometimes in high demanding games it goes to 70°c but when we go to the event viewer it doesn't say anything about overheating",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, we used mine gpu which is a Geforce RTX 3070 Ti and it took an hr to crash instead of the usually 5 minutes.",Neutral
AMD,what voltage would you recommend thenn?,Neutral
AMD,"Huge disclaimer to make sure you get the cable that came with that PSU. But yes, a broken cable could do what OP's bf is seeing.",Neutral
AMD,"I saw in another comment that you mentioned having no crash log in event viewer right?  I was having the same trouble, could you try running some low demanding games? (Something like stardew or terraria could work). Personally for me, i was able to play some games like payday 2 and vermintide 2 for hours but everytime i launched fortnite or arc raider it would hard crash my pc after barely 5-10min idle.  I also saw your problem seems to stem from the GPU you said, faulty motherboard maybe? Even new components can be faulty sometimes. Especially if you checked with another GPU and the only difference was the time it took to crash. If you have another pc, check both gpu in that other computer to verify!",Neutral
AMD,"850W PSU is the minimum for that CPU/GPU combo. 1000W is recommended so you should be fine wattage wise. It looks like a gold model. Keep in mind the platinum and titanium versions are always better.  Looks like the Fractal case has 3 fans in the front? Any others? Rear exhaust, top exhaust, etc.  Got any more specs on the RAM? how many GB and what is the rating? 3200Mhz, 6000Mhz, etc. Were the 2 sticks a matched pair? Meaning were they sold as a kit. You can run into a lot of problems adding more RAM even if it is the exact same model if it isn't bought together as a matched kit.  I'm not sure what you are using to monitor temps. I would use Afterburner to monitor CPU and GPU temps. You can also set an on screen display to monitor temps in game with the included RTSS software. It will also allow you to set a custom fan curve to keep the GPU nice and cool.",Positive
AMD,Fixed that!!! I was waiting on 2 things that I didnt know that I had to bug him about,Neutral

AMD,We did do a normal stress test but not one directly for ram,Neutral
AMD,"Also check if the plastic is off the block, preventing the paste from actually working",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, its a new cooler, all fans are working overtime in some games. Its a brand new PSU aswell",Positive
AMD,"I had same issue, checked everything. My issue was wrong apply of thermal paste so once it got used up and cpu was bare bones without paste it started shutting down. First i changed psu but problem persisted. And once i removed aio cooling i saw how the paste got smushed all over the place but not much left on cpu… once i changed the shutting down stopped",Negative
AMD,Thermaright FC140 CPU Air cooler,Neutral
AMD,Yeah I had this issue myself when the fan on my GPU started to fail and I didn't notice.  This was back in the days of single-fan GPUs though so YMMV.,Negative
AMD,"Yep. Was thermal paste for me, but my system was older. I redid the thermal paste on the GPU and CPU and haven't had an issue since.",Neutral
AMD,Ive had random completely shut downs and found out it was the wall outlet so I swapped it back to a surge protector on the same outlet and that fix the issue. However it may mostly be the the PSU if its only during demanding game but can't hurt to try if you haven't yet.,Neutral
AMD,"That actually sounds very normal.   Sorry was autocorrected without realizing it.  Has he gone into his bios to check ram timings for his specific ram? My sisters pc was having this issue for months.... But we live 7 hours apart and she doesn't have enough confidence to check ram timings.   When I was down for Christmas, I found the right setting for her ram on her and cpu, gigabyte mono and RAM. It's been rock solid since.",Neutral
AMD,The fact that it still happens with your card makes it seem like the PSU. The reason it happens faster with his card is because it uses more power.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah if the crashing one is 5+ years old especially it seems likely that's the issue. Interesting that your GPU also crashed though... Maybe multiple failure points.,Negative
AMD,Wattage. Recommended 850W but that's just the minimum.,Neutral
AMD,1000W is fine,Positive
AMD,"Personally, I use PC Part Picker for everything. Let's you know exactly what you need for your rig - like voltage.",Neutral
AMD,"Keep in mind some PSU has long warranty period. I checked Corsair (assuming you have Corsair RX1000) and it has 10 years warranty. So try to RMA it, it's the least cost replacement you can do right now.",Neutral
AMD,"Also, check their BIOS dates! Ive heard there was issue with older bios for that motherboard (quick search rn gave me some videos)",Neutral
AMD,Hes been able to play Fallout new vegas and Octopath traveler 2 with little to no issues,Neutral
AMD,He actually has 4 ram sticks but only using a matching set. I dont know exactly what the ram sticks are.,Neutral
AMD,"If you changed the board its probably the ram that died or one of em got a static charge , be happy it wasnt everything if thats the case. replace the Ram Lettuce know",Positive
AMD,"I'm running a very similar setup, same cou/GPU with an Asus board.  I had ram issues, a small voltage increase and docp profile II solved my issues.  I wasn't crashing every game though, only occasionally, but did crash running certain synthetic benchmarks every time.  This was a crash/freeze though for me, not a power down/shut off.",Neutral
AMD,Have you repasted the CPU thermal paste?,Neutral
AMD,"Like others have said, the most likely issue is the PSU (It was the first thing that I replaced figuring that it was the issue).  If he changes that and it still crashes, you might want to check the GPU, although if you don't have your old one or access to another one, that might be difficult.",Negative
AMD,"A normal stresstest will usually put a load on everything, so you can't confirm/eliminate the cause. A stresstest per component, like the one from AIDA64, will let you do that.",Neutral
AMD,Sounds like a defective PSU then?,Neutral
AMD,"Totally enough for a 9800X3D (assuming it's running properly). I'm going back to defective power supply being the most likely cause, followed by defective motherboard.   (In truth, either is possible, and I'd call it a coin toss as to which is the most likely scenario. But since the Power supply is generally easier to replace than a motherboard, I'd start with the power supply)",Neutral
AMD,"Im not sure if he's done that yet, but I will definitely ask him",Neutral
AMD,> Has he gone into his cups  Can you clarify what you mean by this? Autocorrect BIOS or am I IOoTL?,Neutral
AMD,He just got his gpu about a year ago when his old gpu completely failed,Negative

AMD,I was autocorrected. I meant BIOS. She has an AMD cpu on a Gigabyte. Had to switch to profile 1 EXPO settings.,Neutral
AMD,"Hmm that's not really old enough to wear out unless he's mining crypto or something. If the crashing card also has a bigger power draw, it could point back to the PSU again.",Neutral
AMD,"RAM or GPU is certainly *possible*, but RAM being defective doesn't generally cause *shutdowns* as much as it causes crashes and reboots.   Defective graphics cards, similarly, don't usually cause shutdowns. If they're defective, you'll usually see crashes, reboots, or the display simply winks out while the rest of the machine stays on.   If you've replaced the motherboard already, it's VERY likely to be a defective power supply.",Negative
AMD,"You can check the RAM by trying one stick at a time, and then the other.",Neutral
AMD,It has an integrated gpu so you can just take the graphics card off and test it. If it is a power supply issue it would probably work if you're not using the big gpu since it would be low power. If it still crashes then it might be a different issue.  You can also load up afterburner and turn the power budget down and watch the monitor. Try a benchmark software that runs the gpu hot and see if it crashes when it hits a certain watt pull. If it crashes immediately then it's not the gpu getting hot for sure.  You can also pull one stick and just use one ram stick at a time to see if it is that.  You can also do a portable build of linux and run stuff on there and see if it still crashes.,Neutral
AMD,"Haha yeah I thought it was a pretty funny/fitting autocorrect. If I had to go into BIOS to check my RAM timings I'd want to be in my cups, as well. It usually helps.",Positive
AMD,This. A dead stick of ram usually causes shut downs and BSOD that are inconsistent with no discernible pattern.,Negative

AMD,"The X3D cpus are the best by far, and that's the route I would go here.  The 9800X3D is about 30% faster than the 14700.  The 1% lows of the 9800X3D are the fps average for the 14700.  The 9800X3D also draws significantly less power and creating significantly less heat than the 14700.  If you're doing cpu heavy professional work the 14700 can make sense because of how many cores it has, but for gaming, not even close.",Positive
AMD,There's nothing to be skeptical about. The 9800X3D is a no-brainer. I prefer Nvidia over AMD when it comes to GPUs though. DLSS is crazy good.,Positive
AMD,"The X3D processors are the best indeed. But since you are not getting a 2000$ GPU, the difference in video game performance will only matter in certain niches (e.g. Hearts of Iron, competitive games on a 480Hz screen).   Your current PC looks fine. Switch out the GPU if you are unhappy with AAA performance. I assume you could even slap that 14700f on your current board should the i5 turn out to be an actual issue with anything you play.",Positive
AMD,"In addition to all the other reasons the 9800x3d is the better option, one other is that it is on AMD's newest socket that is going to be supported through 2027 (and likely longer), where the 14700f is on a mostly dead Intel socket.  So even if things start to feel a bit sluggish after 4-5 years, you will have a much easier time finding a CPU upgrade for the AMD option, if you choose to upgrade a couple of parts rather than the entire system.",Positive

AMD,"No, not really... that's not exactly how games or computers work. The CPU can't do the things that GPUs do, and vice-versa.   You could think of it like plumbers and carpenters. You need both of them if you're building a house. But hiring fifty plumbers and one carpenter probably won't get you a house any faster than hiring one plumber and one carpenter.   In this case, the difference between the 9070 and the 5070 is pretty minimal, so going for the *much* faster CPU means it's overall a better choice. But in a situation where the difference between GPUs was bigger, the question is more complicated.",Neutral
AMD,At 1440p both GPUs are fine. If you plan on playing at 4k at some point then the 5070 to has the edge.   The 9800X3D is better in both cases.,Positive

I have a similar mini itx case with no front fans and some light ventilation areas on top and on the motherboard side and the 5600 i have in there thermal throttles playing games. I have a thermalright mini tower cooler with 5 heat pipes on it since it was pretty much the biggest thing that would fit without taking up all the space in there and blocking any remaining airflow it had. The 6800xt in there is cooled by some bottom fans and stays at a decent temp though. It's my cpu that overheats unless I take off the side panel.

AMD,IMO amd needs to set up a registered gamers list people can register on. And allow them to buy GPUs at MSRP during trying times . . . AMD also needs to work with memory suppliers and others to make sure their supply chain has the capacity to meet the demand of the registry.  would be a huge PR win for AMD and a big win for gamers who want a GPU too. I think the caveate would be you need to register 12+ months prior or something like that so AMD can make sure they have supply chain deals set up.,Positive

The two i bought were not at the really bad times, but they were also both a gen before the good times, which also sucks.  2026 looks to be a lost year to gamers.  2027 is probably also a lost year, and if rumors are true the next gen will be late 2027...

AMD,"GPU + VRAM is a large part of a card's BoM, but AMD aren't setting Navi 48 at unreasonably high prices. AIB manufacturers usually only make ~10% profit. By not adhering to MSRP, they doubled that or more. That's the actual problem (and what an actual free market does). AMD really can't do anything other than encourage their partners to sell at better prices. After AMD sells the chips, their part in the retail channel is very limited without MBA cards competing. And when you have Nvidia selling a direct competitor card at higher prices, guess what AIB manufacturers want to do?  RDNA4's launch was essentially demand pricing. AIB manufacturers took advantage of high demand and once the limited numbers of cards at MSRP were gone, many went to $749 or higher. Now they've stabilized, but VRAM shortages will soon affect every GPU, not just AMD's. If AMD stops bundling VRAM, board partners will have to source their own GDDR6 chips. That's going to get ugly.",Negative

AMD,"You make the card you can actually sell to someone. How many people wake up tomorrow and think ""oh yes, a RTX 5090 for $5000 is exactly what I want to buy"".  Memory got more expensive and they have to adjust prices, not discontinue selected products. That's all I said.",Neutral

AMD,"> 5 years is a long time....but it seems I've already been forced on that cycle.    If you're buying a 7+ number range not really. I bought my 3080 back in 2021. Then i got my 9070 XT in 2025 which was 4 years of use.    To be honest, i realistically didn't need to upgrade the card as it was still doing fairly well. It was only in 2025 that it was starting to creak with some games - and that could have been compensated for with DLSS performance.    In part thanks to upscaling, the jump in performance between each generation of card isn't really that dramatic. And because most game devs focus their optimisation for consoles and mid-range - a mid-high tier card can last you quite a while.",Neutral

AMD,"A midrange can last quite awhile, as long as you have enough vram.  A lot of people are going to end up with a card that does not have enough vram between now and the next gen of gpus....over the next 1.5-2yrs. Anyone falling into that trap is going to be on a short upgrade cycle for the next card. Which all works out great for the people selling gpus. They get to sell people into planned obsolescence and blame high ram prices.   I personally was going to buy a 9070xt. But i was not willing to pay over msrp on principal. By 6 months later i just said F it will wait another gen....and stopped looking at stock and prices. In hind sight, now that we know the next gen is delayed a year, and ram prices are going to be shit for a good while....i should have just paid the extra 20% over msrp on launch day for the 9070xt... But, I'm certainly not going to pay 20% over a year later... So, I'm still at F this gen....even tho my 8gb card is starting to annoy me quite a bit now(it was fine, more and more games are not fine, and im currently paying a game that is quite bad on 8gb no matter how low i make the settings). I could easily go buy a 9070xt today; but on sheer principle im not paying over msrp a year into a gpu cycle. I'm a stubborn goat...",Negative

AMD,"What more did you want? It was based on an outdated architecture from day 1.   The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.",Negative
AMD,"> What more did you want? It was based on an outdated architecture from day 1.  Yes lets excuse a company for a bad product, a lack of investment in software, shit drivers, and lacking support. And zero forward thinking.   Meanwhile the RTX 2080 which released a year earlier for the same price saw a lot longer useful lifespan, feature, and drive support.   And they repeated it again basically pulling the plug on RDNA2 and RDNA3 because they still weren't forward thinking or investing in the right things. But hey it will probably happen to RDNA4 when UDNA rolls around too, so at least they're fair ish in shafting the people that buy their GPUs.   >The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.  Given their track record I doubt any further development occurs, especially since their market share is at an all time low. It will probably have a few more promises, be implemented in a few games, and then put out to pasture when their next arch drops.

AMD,Bro it won’t be significantly better. I think in their keynote they said what 5% ? It was single digits best case scenarios . It’s basically a “KS” sku compared to a “K” sku in terms of intel chips. It will likely be priced higher it IS the best gaming chip.

AMD,"All I want from AMD is a balanced APU, a solid CPU and a solid GPU. I genuinely don’t understand this weird obsession companies have with slapping a midrange GPU next to an absurdly overkill CPU. Why can’t we get a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 level CPU paired with something like an 8060S?   Instead, it’s always a top of the lone Ryzen 9 or Intel i9 equivalent paired with what’s basically a midrange GPU. All that does is jack up the cost for no real benefit and push the final price way higher than it needs to be. A 12 core CPU driving a 60 TFLOP GPU is still massive overkill, and it just feels like wasted silicon and money to me.",Negative

AMD,IMHO it won't be cheap enough over CPU + dGPU combo - and it's system you can upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"In my experience, the 385 already fits the bill. I got the Framework Desktop mobo, shopped around for deals on the other components, managed to get a sub-4L build for about $1000. Installed Bazzite, logged in to Steam, and was gaming within minutes.  The only lingering flaw - and granted, it IS a pretty major flaw at the moment considering the use case - is that Sleep doesn't work properly and seems to cut power to both USB and the network card even after waking. I'm confident I'll resolve whatever the issue is, but until then, being sure to power down after every session isn't a very difficult thing to do, especially since the only thing I'm using it for is gaming.",Neutral

AMD,Wrong order lol.,Negative
AMD,"I’m hoping the 8 core model is the sweet spot. The 395 is way overkill in the cpu department and ram department for the average user.   Not all of us want gobs of ultra fast ram to run hot dog/not hot dog. Some of use just want a decent apu for low power, quiet couch gaming.",Negative

AMD,Agreed. Although I did buy a 395+ framework desktop 😂,Neutral
AMD,395 isn't meant for most people.,Neutral
AMD,I was looking into this and there is a use case you may be missing. This will give you steam machine performance in a 2-3L PC case. Getting a dGPU into something like the MS-A2 (closest comparison I can come up with easily) requires jumping through a ton of hoops and will be more expensive besides.   This has a very niche use case compared to what you suggested and if money is a concern at all your solution is probably better.,Neutral
AMD,You will most likely be able to grab a cheap Chinese mini pc which will beat any cpu + gpu combo in terms of value and size . As a 1080p steam box it would be great heck even the current 870m is decent enough for 1080p gaming . An 8745h machine is like $350 for a fully built system.  I’m not suggesting it’s for everyone but there is definitely a strong use case,Positive

AMD,I guess we wait and see,Neutral
AMD,I've been using an 8700g for the past couple of years and it's fine for 1080p/low gaming but in all these SFF systems it's the GPU that's the bottleneck.  I have no doubt the 8050s is a great improvement on the 780m but I'd still rather have the 8060s,Neutral
AMD,"How many watts does it run at, and how long does a battery charge last?  I'd like to maintain a stable, true 60 FPS for 2-3 hours without it feeling like a turbine.  A low preset would be fine, especially in modern titles like Cyberpunk, Gothic Remake, etc.",Neutral

AMD,Right but at one point they didnt back dlss to the 10 series. They can't. Amd also cant just slap the same fsr on rdna3 without drawbacks. They gotta make a version for rdna 3.5. Rdna3 should be getting one as well.,Negative
AMD,"Thanks so much for sharing this, it completely flew under my radar, it's definitely one I'm going to be keeping my eye on as I liked the design on the 2025 model. I would ideally prefer 16 inch but I love how this laptop has 2x m.2 so it will make it really easy to just slot my old SSD in and go.  I'm not worried much about the price, I wouldn't mind going a bit over £2000 for a 64gb model, definitely one I'm going to keep an eye on.",Positive
AMD,They said 16 inches,Neutral

AMD,"I was considering a framework desktop, how are you liking it?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, if you are into very-SFF then this can do things other builds can't. Current Framework and Chinese Strix Halo 395 boards are priced at like $2700+ and with current DRAM shenanigans 388 with 32GB RAM may loose the price advantage it initially would have. Steam Machine will win this one by a big margin I guess.",Neutral

AMD,"Radeon's most successful period was under AMD from 2008-2013. They carried AMD for a lot of that time while their CPU division faltered.  Also ATI were in financial trouble when AMD bought them, so it was unlikely they could have continued without a buyout.",Neutral
AMD,"It's cool. Using it exclusively for llm models. It acts as the backend for OpenWeb uI. Since the nic is only 5Gb, I keep the models on the device. Eventually I'm going to put it in another case so I can use the x4 slot for a 25G card and centralize my model storage.  But performance is strong all things considered. It doesn't chug when trying to generate a result. I think the biggest delay is the time from when it loads the model requested into memory before it starts processing",Negative
AMD,"Looking through the CES news, I saw that AMD teased a reference dev box. They called it the Ryzen AI Halo. A AI Max+ 395 with 128GB. If there is even just a hint of them dropping this thing with a ""reasonable"" price tag in Germany, I'll just grab one of those.  My hopes for a decent sub-2L chassis with a 388 and 64GB of RAM feel rather slim. I rather avoid the possibility of filing a warranty claim against a Chinese brand.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m still waiting to see what we actually get from the steam machine personally, We still need specs and price point.

AMD,"Honestly, the ms-02 ultra is what I was considering if using dgpu but it is almost twice the size. I would be hard pressed to beat the 3090 in my 15L so it needs to be a usff case or be close to matching my current rig in a slightly larger form factor (2-5L).",Neutral
AMD,Performance wise I have no clue but design wise it fills the same general market.  Hits in the same ballpark as a mobile 3060.

AMD,They’d lagged a bit but they still competed in the high end and in the early 2000s made halo products like the 9800 XT.

AMD,"I mean what would you need it for, in your use case? Is it for Jellyfin to stream faster?",Neutral
AMD,Use rclone instead of rsync or standard copy-paste for initial model uploads so that you can better saturate the bandwidth and do not use a switch do peer to peer it absolutely 0 benefit and adds latency and overhead unless multiple devices are connected to the central storage and that you cna not do peer to peer for some reason. Also  use a script to trigger a read of the model file into the storage server's RAM cache before the worker nodes request it so that the you cna leverage the full wire speed  also use a storage node and install a PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD. If you are gonna use a dedicated storage server use  ZFS Mirror or RAID-Z with multiple NVMe drives. You can use RDMA but you need a RoCE-capable NIC and if you re gonna get a Nic dont get a single 25g get dual since the pci4x4 port can support it and you can aggregate it. Also you can leverage like zram and cache the data in the ram. Both on the machine and on the storage  and  try to keep it in the ram or have it swap it to the zram on the storage one since its superior to the disk.,Neutral
AMD,"No, jellyfin does not need that much bandwidth; many tvs come with only 100 Mbit ethernet, and the streaming platform with the highest quality streams (Apple TV) top at about 50 Mbit.  The GP gave a hint: centrally storing LLM models. These files can be huge (e.g. gpt-oss-120b has ~64 GB, llama-3.3-70b has ~37 GB, glm-4.7 depending on quantization can have 100-250 GB), so you need as much bandwidth as possible when loading them over network.",Neutral

XeSS is also way better than FSR3 so at ""Quality"" mode (720p internal), it should be running at ~62fps with decent image quality.

AMD,"Time is money for productivity use cases tho. It’s situational, I don’t game much but it was easy for me to go with the 9950x3d for just an extra $100, especially when you’re likely pairing it with a 5090 if not 5080 as a top spec video editing rig.   A 4% improvement to a 4 hour render is 10 minutes saved, so it does add up quickly.",Positive
AMD,"It’s not a 4% improvement to the render, that was part of the point of that. It’s 4% to specific workloads within the program that are not a sizeable chunk of program time.  Your render time is wholly GPU driven in Davinci. Most of the actions done on the timeline and in color grading are also wholly GPU driven. The chip won’t save 4% of your time unless those specific actions are all you’re doing for some reason.  If you’re spending a lot of time in Unreal on tasks like shader compilations? Sure, that’s gonna save time and arguments could be made for it. Particularly since that line of work also often ends up running said unreal project, which itself benefits from the chip.  “don’t find the additional gaming performance worth the price increase over the 9950X and 9900X” is a literal quote from the article right after saying they can’t recommend the chips for every workflow, among a couple others, as a reason not to spend the extra money and the article is assuming MSRP that only puts them 50 apart.  Edit: 4% is within Pugent’s margin of error, as an aside.  Edit2: since people get territorial over this kind of stuff sometimes. I *have* an x3d chip. As I mentioned originally there’s essentially no difference in most workloads, it’s primarily a gaming chip. If you need the best option for gaming get one. If you need the best option for productivity specifically then there’s a big ol’ pause there with a lot of asterisks.",Neutral

Games render using one GPU or the other, not both. So why access an inactive GPU's VRAM data? Even if you could write to it like extra memory, that defeats the entire point of VRAM, it's just far far too slow, it would kill performance.  So again what are THEY talking about?",Neutral
AMD,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".  It's only a question of how large the mapped address area is, and where in VRAM it's pointing at any given moment.",Neutral

AMD,Moore's Law is Dead channel lol,Negative
AMD,[Stay tuned.](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3024786/amd-qa-at-ces-2026-we-talk-ryzen-and-more.html),Neutral
AMD,"If I were to guess, why charge a lower amount now when AMD can charge a higher amount later. And probably, even the 7800x3d is faster than the competition in gaming so AMD just doesn't have competition when it comes to gaming.",Neutral
AMD,9950X3D2 will be a weird product. It will have same gaming performance and need CCD parking just like 9950X3D. Adding cache to the second CCD does not help the cross CCD latency.  It only does CPU render and other ram bottlenecked compute workloads faster. And those workloads runs much better with a threadripper or EPYC.,Negative
AMD,"It's basically the whole industry right now, intel 300 pantherlake series cpus are just as confusing as amd' cpus",Negative
AMD,Is it? This is successor to the APU 300 series. 400 seems like a rather logical decision. This isn’t meant succeed the CPU 9000 series.,Neutral
AMD,not for them its not. now they can charge more,Neutral
AMD,"Naming scheme yes, CPUs probably not.   Remember, it's AMD. Their marketing people generally cannot allow themselves to have a consistent naming scheme for more than 2 generations. Plus there probably was an order from the top to integrate ""AI"" somehow so it's even more visible.",Neutral
AMD,"Aren't they just moving to most everything having an iGPU, like Intel?   That was kinda the whole reason for the G, I thought...",Neutral
AMD,When AMD puts laptop apus onto a am5 socket they will just use the laptop chip name instead of making up a new half generation line. Last generation they had 7000 and 8000g. It looks like they ran out of numbers and could not do 10000g after ryzen 9000,Negative
AMD,"AI just means it has an NPU, there will likely still be budget SKUs without.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm currently using a 3400G Vega 11. My next upgrade, once RAM is cheaper, would be the top-of-the-line G series. Are integrated graphics going to disappear? I'm confused.",Neutral
AMD,Who's going to buy them when the RAM costs more than the CPU?,Negative
AMD,"Funny thing is [Dell of all companies have started pointed out how marketing PCs as AI is backfiring](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/dells-ces-2026-chat-was-the-most-pleasingly-un-ai-briefing-ive-had-in-maybe-5-years/).

AMD,"they dont care, and they wont waste a waffle to make low market chip.",Negative
AMD,Maybe it will be another Microcenter exclusive.  :-),Neutral
AMD,It's a bizarre decision to cancel something like that because of competition when there wasn't competition in the first place.,Negative
AMD,This is highly likely. AMD simply is too good and they are waiting and delaying and milking current X3D options. The minute Intel has something remotely close you’ll see new releases.,Neutral
AMD,"the existance has been known for awhile. private overclockers have been known to have had engineering samples of them i think reported on GN, as well as the cpu had actual benchmark leaks for an [ID existance](https://overclock3d.net/news/cpu_mainboard/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d2-cpu-benchmark-results-leak/).  Not all products are released, but its hard to deny they didn't exist.",Neutral
AMD,"With how inaccessible RAM is becoming to consumers, I'd sooner believe it's canceled because it's a niche, expensive product that people are going to be priced out of. They can't sell it for more later if RAM keeps climbing to a point where no one considers buying DDR5-based PCs worth the cost.",Negative
AMD,"Yes and no  Intel is making NEW chips.  AMD is, as per usual, literally just renaming their old shit",Neutral
AMD,"Because they named the previously mobile to desktop series the 8000 lineup.  I'm guessing this is also how AMD is going to rename the next Zen6 desktop series then, making it the 500 AI series.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah end-users and consumers sure love... ""AI"" plastered all over everything. Especially when OpenAI and co. are why everything costs too damn much.",Negative
AMD,"Job security for their marketing team lol, needless and confusing name scheme changes every so often 😅",Neutral

AMD,"The G naming scheme has existed since zen+, so I dunno wtf you’re yapping about. Ryzen AI has also been a thing for years now.",Neutral
AMD,Isn't this almost every computer part/peripheral manufacturer and in general a lot of companies that do this to confuse the consumer to make them take bad choices.,Negative
AMD,"G is supposed to be a much better iGPU, the main 7000 series desktop has 2CU RDNA2 while the 780M in the 8700G is 12CU at a higher boost clock. They're usually refered to as APUs rather than iGPUs.",Neutral
AMD,"G = gaming, otherwise the non-g 7000 processors would also be G because they have graphics",Neutral
AMD,you'll be lucky to get a 5600GT if AMD doesn't start producing new AMD Renoir processors (mainly used for laptops),Neutral
AMD,"Individuals no, but businesses on fixed upgrade cycles and people who desperately need one would just pay the price anyway.",Negative
AMD,"I will, I bought RAM before the price hike. The only thing left is to either get the 8700G or this 400G. I'm building a living room PC in a 21x21x11cm case and I want to be able to play games locally while also be able to stream more demanding games onto it from my actual gaming PC",Neutral
AMD,If it is just shows they couldn't produce them in any type of quantity.   Counter to the reddit hiveminds beliefs Microcenter doesn't even serve 1/4th of the United States.   The fact they don't ship makes it worse.,Negative
AMD,"Microcenter my beloved, just picked up an open box 7800X3D from them today.",Neutral
AMD,self-competition is a real thing. If you sell 8 variations of the same thing you're increasing your overhead by managing a bunch of SKUs and reducing sales by confusing customers,Neutral
AMD,So many people don't realize this. Remember when the roadmap for an Nvidia board partner leaked shortly after the 30 series launch and the 20gb 3080 was on it? It never actually materialized but recently someone posted an engineering sample of it.,Neutral
AMD,There are plenty of AM5 owners who already own what they need and will upgrade,Positive
AMD,We will see people upgrading from Ryzen 7 5800X3D to Ryzen AI 580X3D.,Neutral
AMD,7000 -> 8000 -> 200  renaming bullshit to trick consumers    Now 300 -> 400 more renaming bullshit.   AMD isn't releasing anything relevant in the mobile space so they just keep renaming shit. There is small wonder intel is simply superior in every aspect of mobile computing   ... now if only they can put out a game focus desktop chip they will stop losing buyers there,Negative
AMD,"I bought 32 GB DDR4 ram in 9th of June last year for 101 e. Just checked the price of that exact same kit from where I bought it and it's now 303 e. Really drove home how insane the prices are getting.  Also looking at price charts, it seems my timing was pretty good, since price for DDR4 shot up in mid June and has kept rising since. So, I probably should also mention, I ordered a new GPU on Sunday.",Negative
AMD,Getting close to going with an actual r/ayymd CPU name,Neutral
AMD,The thing is standard businesses aren't buying products *because* they have AI branding. AI branding is just tech bro circlejerk bs designed to give the venture capitalists their dopamine hit so they give the company more money to continue this charade.,Negative
AMD,"However, that's also what allows them to avoid the scammers when new products launch and to give their deals.",Neutral
AMD,All of which I'm OK with.,Neutral
AMD,"I got a 7600X3D the other week for my living room gaming box.  It will no doubt still be GPU limited, but it was pretty inexpensive for an AM5 chip.",Positive
AMD,Managing a bunch of SKUs and confusing customers has basically been AMD's entire mobile strategy.,Neutral
AMD,and pull out their rx 580 for memes,Neutral
AMD,"Redid my comp just this past week (9800x3D, 32GB RAM, etc.) and helped some family on that front with redoing hardware or picking out new laptops. Prices are higher than I like but some of the builds were going on their 8-9th year of operation. Better to eat the cost of DDR5 now when it's at local stores for about 200-300, than be forced to eat it later in the year when stuffs more apocalyptic. The 5800x3D I swapped out in my build already sells for more than a new 9800x3D on ebay judging by listings.   Some friends are also swapping their GPUs while they are still MSRP.",Neutral
AMD,Not necessarily a bad thing. I tried playing with the power limit set to the minimum on my 9070XT and I was surprised how little performance it lost. And the card was dead quiet while only drawing 200W or so.   Hopefully they will put a decent heatsink on it so that it will be silent.,Neutral
AMD,"9070XT with a 9070 BIOS or just 9070, -20% power limit, put in an x4 slot/mode",Neutral
AMD,Why not just use a 9070 instead?,Neutral
AMD,"My 9070XT is amazing at -25% PL and -40 undervolt. Like, almost dead quiet at arms length during heavy gameplay. That's a 3 fan model, tho.  I wonder what a skinny 2 fan can do at 180w. Probably not even close to a full TDP 9070.   Can't help but wonder if they can put this GPU in a steamachine like desktop thingy.",Positive
AMD,Meanwhile I want a 500W+ BIOS bc I'm on water.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah looks like a size constrained limitation  Theres probably no AC to 12V 300W PSU in that size range,Negative

AMD,"My Asus ROG NUC 2025 houses a 140W 5070 TI mobile that handles it fine. Within it is also a CPU that can boost up to 120W as necessary.   GPU's don't need to be as large as they are, there's more than enough space for heatsinks to run that GPU at 180w.   I doubt it'll be worth the price, the use cases for these things are the niche of niches at such a price point.",Positive

AMD,9800X3D + some mhz or whatever.  Good lord hardware releases are boring right now.,Negative
AMD,"I imagine it looks a lot like a 9800X3D, except it says 9850X3D instead, since you know, it's exactly the same CPU, just binned. What even is this? What happened to journalism?",Negative
AMD,I’m still waiting to hear if the 9850X3D will support PBO and/or overclocking. If no then the gap to the 9800X3D is effectively even less.,Neutral
AMD,"Do new sites even do basic thinking these days? Fake as hell, there's no way the IHS says 2024, considering AMD transitions that date super fast, with the 9950X3D, manufactured in the second week of January 2025, already having a 2025 date on the IHS. The real 9850X3D will have a 2025 date at least, if not a 2026 one.",Negative
AMD,"Bro thinks hes god, what a loser.",Neutral
AMD,"That's what happen when one company dominate a certain market. Just like when Intel released their quad cores CPU years after years. Now it's AMD being successful with the CPU market, Intel really lost their customers after multiple CPU issues.",Neutral
AMD,Its how the CPU Market was from like 2011 till Ryzen launched in 2016.,Neutral
AMD,Strangling enough it also looks like a 9600x,Neutral
AMD,why wouldnt it,Neutral
AMD,?  All of the retail samples of the 9950X3D have a 2024 year date printed on them.,Neutral
AMD,If they have pushed the silicon to the absolute limit already it may have no headroom left.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly, it's not the manufacturing date but the trademark date.",Neutral
AMD,"So they tried to NOT release it for desktops to save their video card business and then the Chinese took the Strix Halo and put it into mini pcs which meant the big computer companies lost out to selling them to consumers.  Now they are making desktop chips because everyone is upset with them. At least it will decrease the current rip off prices for the Strix halo mini pcs in the future, albeit distant future…",Negative
AMD,I don’t think they refused to sell to mainstream oems. I think nobody wanted it for the price they wanted to sell them for. Hence they had to add the 388 and 392 to make it cheaper but still 40CU. It also can’t be sold as an AM5 cpu because it’s not compatible.,Negative
AMD,Strix Halo can't work on the desktop because it has a 4 channel memory controller. These are just embedded parts with ECC and additional certification and testing.,Neutral
AMD,I had forgotten that the gap between that and the 9800X3D was so huge,Neutral
AMD,"Playing at 4K (7900xtx, 5800x3D) my bottleneck is not my cpu :-) .   Ill wait for AM6.",Neutral
AMD,"man, if I could just jump to a 5700x3d, it would be a huge upgrade. 16MB L3 cache in the 5500 is a huge bottleneck for some games (like Cyberpunk)  in Brazil you can't find these chips for less than 800 dollars lol.",Positive
AMD,"Got onto AM4 earlier in 2025 to find 5800X3D already being sold out, and snagged 5700X3D instead.  Really want to move to AM5, but might be holding onto this for a long time.",Negative
AMD,"Started on AM4 with a 2700x, now sitting with a 5800x3d and the same board. I have zero reason to move off this chip in the foreseeable future.   I also started with a GTX 1070, and moved to a 6900XT at release. I'm confident it can take another GPU upgrade down the road still.",Neutral

AMD,Meanwhile I just upgraded my 6 year old CPU with a 14600k last week and reused my existing ddr4 ram lol. The price was far cheaper than the 5800x3d and the performance upgrade is absolutely insane. It even routinely beats most ddr5 systems as well in productivity tasks and emulation.,Positive
AMD,5800X3D & 9070 XT 💪,Neutral

AMD,Upgrade GPU to 5070ti...paired with my 5800X3D....seems like a good combo ..will skip Zen 5 for now..,Positive
AMD,Yeah would be a day 1 purchase for me. I wasn't aware they will be discontinued and missed the boat sadly.,Neutral
AMD,I have a 5900X and my plan was to upgrade with the generation after 9800X3D.... looks like it will be very expensive...,Negative
AMD,"the key takeaway is that 5800x3d gamers can upgrade GPU in 2027 for GTA 6 or Witcher 4, then maybe finally upgrade CPU in another 3-4 years time",Positive
AMD,"By the time I found out about the RAM prices, 64gb was already €600+. I looked for something second hand and managed to score a 5800X3D, a TUF B550 WIFI II and 4x8GB of DDR4 for €500. The bottleneck now is my 7800XT, but I'm not going to upgrade anytime soon. I have been using the leaked INT8 FSR4 and I'm happy with the results that gives.",Neutral

AMD,"I think people are taking the wrong conclusion - the 9800X3D is a halo product right now. Appears to me that with RT enabled and/or on 4k video, you're not going to miss much between the two platforms. Or, sticking on AM4 means that users can instead get better monitors. I think the 5700/5800X3D is overkillfor 1080p but I won't yuck someone else's yum",Neutral
AMD,Best CPU of 2022 against best CPUs of 2023/2024.    A result you could have seen by just... checking the reviews of said CPUs in 2024.,Negative
AMD,"Oh, he has his serious face on, that's how we know this is serious.",Neutral
AMD,"should have added 7800x3d ,its easily the best value x3d performance part rn",Positive
AMD,14600k is clear winner here. For 170 its a steal,Neutral
AMD,Or just crank the graphics settings until the CPU isn’t the bottleneck. This shouldn’t be too hard. The Venn Diagram of 5080/9070XT users and non-3D AM4 CPU users has got to be pretty slim.,Neutral
AMD,I really really really don't get this and will continue to say this:     buy an 5950x. it's just a few percent slower in half the games and in the other half of use cases (and games) it's faster then the x3D.      this AM4 x3D hype is getting ridiculous and there is a better alternative available. yes. I said better.,Negative
AMD,"Next they say, bring back win98.  technology advances to fast for these guys on youtube to keep up",Neutral
AMD,yes I did this upgrade in April 5800X3D to 9800X3D is a huge jump.,Positive
AMD,Depends on the resolution and GPU I suppose. 1080p on a 5090 shows the gap. Say 4k on a 9070XT and the gap would be a lot smaller.,Neutral
AMD,"Assuming a 3 year delta between the two, back in the old days it would have been what... a 150% increase? I think the 5800x3d was the GOAT CPU but that was mostly because of the uplift between simulation style games.  Of course that does not excuse Intel for being such shit.",Neutral

AMD,Will be interesting to see Zen 3 X3D Vs Zen 7 X3D.,Positive
AMD,Ditto,Neutral
AMD,"I got my 9800X3D about a year ago, I can't wait to replace it in 5-7 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, people freak out way too much about CPU. They upgrade the CPU despite not having any CPU bottleneck. My 12900k with DDR4 and a4080super can easily push 120+fps with zero CPU bottlenecking. People should start using tools like Afterburner to actually check their bottlenecks and not just assume.  If you are on AM4 a 5700x will do the trick most of the time. No need to buy into AM5 and DDR5 at current prices.",Neutral
AMD,Actually lol… 7900xtx too w a 5800x3d to 9800x3d and my 5800xt was the bottleneck,Neutral
AMD,_oblivion remastered enters the chat_,Neutral
AMD,Are you sure? Because you probably use dlss. Which is effectively not 4k,Neutral

AMD,IIRC in latin american you have the 5500X3D which has a 96 MB L3,Neutral
AMD,"Is Cyberpunk known for being particularly CPU intensive?

AMD,"I can confirm this, I started out with a 5500 and then moved to a 5600x with 32MB of cache. MAN the DIFFERENCE that made was unbelievable lol. I will be getting a 5800x3D if they are brought back",Positive
AMD,Why did you go AM4 so late and not just AM5 in 2025?,Neutral
AMD,obligatory this is a product for people already on AM4 not new computers,Neutral
AMD,This is for people who's already on AM4.  Plenty of people with R5 3600 or 5600 looking to get better performance would benefit a lot from an upgrade to a 5700X3D or 5800X3D,Positive
AMD,Yeah it is nuts. I ordered 2x32GB DDR4 sticks back in 2023 and their price has almost tripled based on Amazon pricing.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, bought 32 GB last June for 101 eur, checked the price of the exact same kit from the same store and it was 303 eur. Prices had started rising mid June. According to the chart I saw, DDR4 prices went up before DDR5, which started rising in the Fall.",Neutral

AMD,Have fun buying DDR5.,Positive
AMD,"I recently picked up the AM5 bundle at micro center (9800X3D, 32GB DDR5, B650E-E) for $680 with the main justification being that I’ll make most of if not all my money back from selling my AM4 parts because holy shit 5700X3Ds go for a stupid amount these days.",Negative
AMD,I got offered 400€ for my 5700x3D. Crazy times lol.,Neutral
AMD,"Those already exist?  The 7 nm prototypes never made it to market, likely for performance reasons they were not measurably better than this chip.  And I mean, they already solved these issues with the 7900X3D which was probably designed \~4.5 years ago.  Their CPU design teams are likely working on Zen 7 and Zen 8 at this point. They're not going to go back to a Zen 3 chip to try to workaround AM4 limitations to deliver a real 5950X3D in 2028 that would require a major BIOS update, be limited to very specific boards and high-end memory.",Negative
AMD,I fail to see why a double CCD X3D chip would be desirable.  If you are gaming then you want your game to be on one CCD to avoid inter-die communication latency. The second die being X3D is just raising manufacturing cost.  If you are rendering / number-cruching then X3D variants don't provide a benefit. Lower clocked ones usually lose out to their non-X3D counterparts when a large L3 cache is not needed.,Negative
AMD,Its not vs its about 5700x3d and 5800x3d in modern games 9800x3d is just for scale,Neutral

I wouldn't know what to upgrade for at the moment, to me it's just not worth the cost. I'd e.g. have more value from going OLED.",Positive
AMD,"Same, upgraded a few months ago right when ram prices started to climb. Was a crazy big jump for a cpu upgrade",Neutral
AMD,"when I upgraded from a 5800x3d to a 9800x3d, I played civ 6 on the largest map with the most AI players using mods.   I used a save game with a turn that had no player interactions (rare).  The 9800x3d was 40% faster on turn time.",Neutral
AMD,"I think thats the distinction that a lot of people fail to make. Even with a more reasonable GPU like a 5070ti, you're still gonna see the most difference at lower resolutions. 4k maxed, probably not. Trying to max a 240 Hz 1440p monitor, it could matter.  I think its good to see the benchmarks to evaluate how CPUs have changed over generations and how they scale across different games. But inevitably these type of videos quickly devolve to people using them to  either justify their upgrade or why they don't need to upgrade any time soon.",Neutral
AMD,"Luckily HUB has benchmarks for just about everything. Cued up to 1440P Ultra results, 4k follows right after. 5800X3D is about in the ballpark of the 7600X (remember all those Zen 5% jokes)  [HUB: CPU/GPU Scaling: 7600X vs. 9800X3D (RTX 5090, 5080, RX 9070 & 9060 XT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpN4nyftQ3M&t=1080s)",Positive
AMD,"Ever since upscaling tech matured, I can't remember the last time I ran a game at native 4k. Especially with DLSS 4.5 (on a 4090) there just doesn't seem to be a reason to. I'd assume most people are upscaling from 1080p or 1440p at this point, and the 9800x3d definitely makes a difference there. I assume FSR4 isn't gonna be much different      Though there's a great few games nowadays that even benefit at 4k due to being so CPU heavy.",Negative
AMD,"Yes because this is CPU test, not GPU",Neutral
AMD,"Well, sure, but there are games that are very CPU demanding even on 4k, like Space Marine 2 or Star Citizen.    If you anticipate being mostly GPU bottlenecked, the upgrade is less essential. But if you run a mix, you might want to consider a faster CPU. Especially now that prices have not become stupid yet.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean yeah, when you're CPU bound you're going to see differences that you wouldn't see when you're not CPU bound. A CPU intensive game is going to show those differences even at 4K on a 9070XT.

AMD,"It will improve, but not by an appreciable amount, and won’t perform significantly better than the 8core X3D part.   As for productivity, some benchmarks might see some gains. But you’ll find a few edge cases where the performance would skyrocket just because some memory bound dataset dealing with random data happens to get an unexpectedly high hit rate on the L3.   The majority of them will however perform near identically. Games are typically “Low IPC” workloads. Not much stuff being done, but it needs to react to things fast.  But productivity software is “High IPC” and the optimization targets in the software and even the compilers simply aren’t designing for CPUs that have this much L3 cache.   They know what a normal CPUs latencies are, and ensure their software is always able to keep the average CPU engine fully fed never waiting for data.  AMD offers some X3D server parts for certain workloads. And they have X3D on all the CCDs. But they aren’t nearly as popular as the classic ones.",Negative
AMD,We'll have to wait and see in the benchmarks. My initial guess is there _may_ be improvements at 1080p if there are games that can benefit from that many cores but for 4k I doubt it'll matter since we're always GPU limited.,Neutral
AMD,It will not improve gaming performance unless you are talking about city skylines 2.  This is a bandaid product for productivity as Zen 5 MSDT were all handicapped by the limited RAM bandwidth.,Negative
AMD,"One thing seems fairly certain about dual x3d CCDs, its going to be a toasty boi and (less certain but highly probable) wont be as fast for gaming as the 9850x3d",Negative
AMD,"In theory yes, in ""real"" situations probably not.  For gaming, you already have enough cores with 3d cache on a 9950x3d, same for (general) productive work, we don't know about the latency between both cdcs yet.  What will gain a massive amount of performance is stuff that is built to use the L3 cache because now you have double the amount of cdc then before.  Still probably better to wait for ZEN6.",Neutral
AMD,"It will improve gaming performance in all of the games where, at stock, the 9800X3D out-performed the 9950X3D.  The ""at stock"" means in the absence of something like *Process Lasso* to ensure the game only ran on the CCD with V-cache, which erases the deficit already.  Outside of that scenario, there are few games which will run faster on the 9950X3D2 over a properly scheduled 9950X3D.  At least right now.",Neutral
AMD,"Some games that can utilize it will improve significantly, something like Star Citizen I imagine would love the extra cache.  Other games will improve immensely compared to the 50/50 x3d-chips like the 7900x3d simply because their OS can't mess up the core-parking since both chiplets are x3d now.  Still other games will have minor improvements from the small uplift in boost clock.  If you're into pure productivity use, a non x3d-chip is probably the way to go as it clocks higher and will chew through serial tasks faster. Maybe it makes a difference if you're doing 3d-art stuff, not sure.",Positive
AMD,It's for nothing basically.. just for some niche apps,Neutral
AMD,"It will be interesting to see if there are any gaming benefits, but I'm sure there are applications that will use all that sweet cache. Probably rendering and handbrake for a start. 9800x3d, or rather 9850x3d now might still be the best gaming cpu.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but there's a couple ways to get around it. Besides there's some people that keep asking for it, and it will make an interesting baseline for the next couple CPU gens.   Rumors exist future architectures may package the CCDs closer together to mitigate the latency. Plus we are getting more cores per CCD.",Positive
AMD,"Yes. This is only a problem because people talk as if X3D is black magic. It just extra L3 cache. The vertically stacked ""3D"" part is just how they're able to squeeze that more cache onto the die.  L3 cache is orders of magnitude faster than even RAM, so any time the CPU can get the data it needs from cache instead of even having to go out to RAM, you get better performance. This applies to everything a CPU does, as well, not just gaming. Gaming simply benefits greatly because, as a workload, it tends to use a lot of the same data over and over again, which means you get a lot of cache hits. A bigger cache means more data can be stored and, the chance of a cache hit versus a miss is greater, as a result. That's it. The entire secret sauce to X3D.  The reason already that the second CCD is disabled is because of the two pools of cache are separate. If a thread on CCD0 requests data, it's added to the the cache on CCD0. If a thread on CCD1 requests the same data, that's not in *its* cache, so you either call it a miss and move on or cross over the fabric to check the cache on CCD0. That instantly slows it down, though, to the point where you might as well have pulled it fresh from memory. Therefore, the way to extract the most performance is to make sure all the threads that are accessing the same cached data are using the same pool of cache, and the way you do that on a multi CCD design is to disable the other CCD.  Adding more cache to the second CCD doesn't solve this problem. The existing cache on the second CCD could already be utilized, if it made any sense to, and all that mattered was more cache overall. It just makes it so that any thread, regardless of which CCD it's on, has access to a large pool of cache. But, you would still want to confine the work for a single application entirely to one CCD to extract the most benefit. It doesn't help gaming at all. It could have some limited productivity benefits.",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe for gaming, but if you use these for compute intensive work and know how to nice your processes, they will go lightning fast.",Positive
AMD,"I think it was not a useful change since each CCD has separate L3 cache so going across the infinity fabric means not using the same cache and adding latency. AMD said they didn't think it would be a useful configuration.  But ""give the people what they want"" is a saying for a reason and people keep begging for both CCDs to be 3D cache",Negative
AMD,"No. Cache is not something that adding more of can hurt. The rest of the die is rumored to be the same, just now both dies have 96MB L3 cache instead of just the one.   Will some workloads *not benefit*? Maybe. But this change doesn't *add* latency. The latency you speak of is already there with your 9950x3d. (Ok.. +2ns to 3DV cache vs the standard L3 layer).",Neutral
AMD,"I think the idea is that the games will still only run on one ccd as per usual, but now you don’t have to worry about making sure the game is on the correct one since they both have the 3D cache",Neutral
AMD,"Lots of apps can deal with the latency and are designed multiple CPU’s with NUMA… gaming is a different story usually. But the writing for intel also, same with Nvidia graphics…. But if a chicken or egg first.",Neutral
AMD,There is no benefits of having 16 cores in games anyways. But CPUs are used for more than just gaming.,Negative
AMD,"Doesn't mean people won't buy it anyway. But I think you're right, I assume it will use core parking the same as the 9950x3d I really don't see the point of having an extra v-cache CCD that's doing nothing while gaming.  I hope I'm wrong and it does turn out to be really cool.",Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely, there won't be any gains for gaming",Negative
AMD,"it improves performance by an appreciable amount due to the homogeneous configuration in specific scenarios.  the inter CCD latency would be more predictable because the core-cache config is symmetric  games? forget project lasso  productivity? memory intensive software like WinRAR should see a considerable performance increase due to having stored the all the dictionary or a bigger portion of it inside the on-die cache.  the performance increase is noticeable, but in very specific scenarios",Positive
AMD,"No, because having the same amount of cache on both CCD's makes that latency essentially irrelevant.",Negative
AMD,the opposite,Neutral
AMD,It's not.,Neutral
AMD,It is not coming.  Turns out it was an engineering prototype undergoing testing. They concluded it was not worth the extra costs because of very little to no improvement in performance.,Negative
AMD,"It's exactly the opposite.  If you run a game on both the V-cache CCD and normal CCD of a 9950X3D, that's when you'd have a lot of cross-CCD traffic to consider.  With both CCD's having V-cache, that scenario goes away, because running code on both CCD's will quickly end up having the same data in cache on each.",Neutral

AMD,Not always gpu limited for 4k gaming. Went from 5900x + 4090 for 4k gaming to 9800x3d + 4090 and it was extremely noticeable in games like escape from tarkov and other cpu intensive games.,Neutral
AMD,"If you look at average FPS yes, for the 0.1% and 1% a better processor does help.",Positive
AMD,"No, because the core problems remain. The reason the second CCD is disabled for the game is to keep all the game threads on the same CCD using the same pool of cache. The X3D CCD is chosen, obviously, because of the higher pool of cache, but either crossing CCDs and/or using two separate pools of cache would slow down performance, and that's still going to be a problem, regardless of if you added more cache to the second CCD. You could potentially play two games at the same time, both with the performance of a 9800X3D, each with their own CCD, but that would obviously be a fairly niche use case.",Neutral
AMD,"Never had to turn off anything on my 9950X3D. For those who have this CPU, set the Cache preference in the BIOS to Driver and install the latest Chipset drivers and you are golden.",Neutral
AMD,What we really need is 12 core CCDs on the future 10800X3D and 10950X3D. That would be a real upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"It's not about the latency that's added due to the large cache he's talking about, it's about cross talk CCD latency aka infinity fabric and I assume also specifically for games.  Most games only use a few threads and we already park the 2nd CCD due to it missing the cache + cross talk latency, so it begs the question how much does adding a second 3d cache really benefit that? If we stop parking the cores we get the cross talk latency which is probably gonna be worse in that scenario, especially because games are very latency sensitive.",Neutral
AMD,You didn't get his question,Neutral
AMD,"Actually it can hurt. More cache, more area, more latency. There will be a point on the cost benefit curve when it crosses from a positive into a negative.  At 5ghz there is only enough time for the signal to travel about 3-4 centimeters before the next cycle begins. You need things to be physical close, or you have to wait cycles in between requests. The more area you add, the more cycles you need to wait.  Just think about it logically, take the supposition to the extreme; imagine an infinite cache, the latency would be infinite.  -----  In this case its not adding more cache to the same ccd, but to the other ccd that lacks it. There wont be any additional latency concerns, so it should be a net positive. However, for anything that sits on one ccd, its not going to help at all. On ryzen, each ccd can only write to its own caches. One ccd can not go and write to the other ccd. It can however snoop the cache of the other ccd(and it must to ensure memory coherency), but this adds cross talk over the infinity fabric. Too much cross talk can likewise hurt performance instead of help. Again i dont think this will be an issue in this case. Its just there is such a thing as too much cache.",Negative
AMD,Unfortunately you still need to worry about making sure the game is only running on 1 CCD. I have a dual CCD CPU (7900) and every time a game is split between CCDs it stutters. It will do the same even if both CCDs have V-Cache.,Negative
AMD,"i thought both don't get 3d cache  they would just doubling the size of the v cache on one ccd ,so core parking is still a issue , i have a 9950x3d and id never upgrade other then finding a way to give both ccds v cache to make core parking a thing of the past but gaining a few Fps due to a double sized vcache on one CCD is just a money grabbing refresh",Neutral

AMD,"You still won't want game threads crossing CCDs. The SerDes interconnect is still not fast enough, nor does it offer enough throughput for cache-cache transfers (and doesn't have this capability). All data will hit system memory if it needs to traverse another CCD. This is a significant latency hit vs V-cache, at least for first transfers. After that, data should be in both CCDs' caches, but there's not really a good way to control workloads with dependencies without locking to a single CCD. Otherwise, threads on both CCDs will stall as they wait for data from one another, traversing system memory, as all cached data is present in RAM.  Parallel ops with independent workloads can task both CCDs without much issue.  EDIT: There might be a way to optimize traffic in software, if it's intelligent and catches op dependencies from traversing CCDs. But, as usual, this has overhead and can still allow some edge cases to cross. Better to have some type of data traffic QoS than nothing though or we're back to parking the other CCD, which seems wasteful to me. Background tasks should operate on the secondary CCD at minimum.

Fanout/sea-of-wires can certainly move in this direction, but honestly, an expensive active interposer or active bridge die might be the only way to get more benefits. A lot of hardware logic is actually needed to bridge CCDs, so maybe AMD doesn't feel it's worth the transistor cost, as each design has strict transistor budgets.

Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck.

They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw.

Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs?

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

Obviously I won't go farther than that in a tech focused discussion lol, but I will say again that it's a different game and I don't think anyone wins if it becomes the norm.""  I'm going to add, light heartedly, I do hope we see AMD/nVidia/Qualcomm/etc manufactured and final packaged products coming out of Intel Foundries one day. I'm not sure how or if it will work, but the situation seems dead set not to allow significant further nodes beyond 2 nm or packaging to occur outside of North America. If the US wants viable national chip production, Intel is the better option, I hope it works out in a way that maintains design level competition while meeting national security goals.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
AMD,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

Only objective way that you have to prove that those sources are spreading misinformation, is to prove it and share it with others - do it, make your own research and share it on Reddit and YouTube, if you're really correct and your data is accurate, it will hurt public reception of these sources(HUB, LTT, GN) and will damage their credibility.  >Every dude that actually verified their claims and build systems how they should be built, will tell you that GN/LTT/HUB reviews are bad and more often maliciously wrong.   [No true Scotsman - ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)sorry dude, but your argument is logically incorrect, for pretty obvious reasons - it's unfalsifiable, it lacks evidence and it assumes the conclusion **- ""every dude"" argument is a way to sound like you have the backing of a consensus without having to provide a single piece of evidence for it -** as I said, real evidence in your case would be substantial evidence that proves that sources that you named in your comment are spreading misinformation, which shouldn't be hard to test and release in public.

AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Neutral
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Neutral
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently.

That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit.

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.

AMD,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications.

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.

AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral

So your claim that HDMI 1.4 is limited to 2560x1440 is false. HDMI 1.4 can go further to 3840 x 2160 without any problems.

AMD,"u/Sk7Str1p3 I'm pleased to confirm that TME is indeed supported on your i7-12700F processor. TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.

AMD,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Negative
AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral

AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it.

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral

AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Neutral
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs.

AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits.

AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.   I on the other hand don't get why would Intel forfeit it's competitive advantage with GPU accelerated AI, XeSS or QuickSync and made itself dependant on nVidia. Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company.

AMD,I have not lied,Neutral
AMD,"While workstations dont directly contribute a big chunk of the sales, I suspect they dont want to yield their foothold on the ML/Data Science guys.  If they start getting familiar with non-nVIDIA ecosystems, it could mean indirect losses when these guys start procuring non-nVIDIA dGPUs in servers when they do port their workstation experiments to ""larger"" hardware now that AI is all the rage.  B60 is gaining momentum on homelabs, and Strix Halo to some extent getting popular for those needing more memory for their larger datasets.",Neutral
AMD,"MLID has used clickbait trash thumbnails/titles way too many times, no one should watch that garbage channel to begin with.",Negative
AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Negative
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus. Like a b580 destroys the 5060 and 5050 while costing less or the same amount. There's no way nvidia invests 5 billion without some agreement that kills off arc as long as they are together.,Negative
AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Neutral
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Neutral
AMD,"You did tho. It doesn't look like ""later versions of DLSS 2"". Every reputable source has said it's better than DLSS 3 and close to DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Positive
