Intel,I thought that was Denis lol,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah this is a really surprisingly open factory tour, at least compared to when Sapphire took Linus and Alex along. It feels unprecedented to see this much access and insight, but that's the goodwill nurtured by Steve paying off in spades. The lament about AMD and Nvidia ditching the sub-250 side is real, so having Arc actually be a usable option down here is going to be significant later on.",Negative
Intel,"Pretty good video with a lot of detail I haven't seen in previous factory tours. I probably still won't use an Intel GPU for gaming, but for a media server it's probably sufficient.  Side note: It's funny how whenever a GN video gets posted, the same cast of characters comes out and writes essays criticizing the video, apparently without watching it. I guess that's what it means to ""make it"".",Positive

Intel,That hat is so useful,Positive
Intel,Making them isn't important selling them is.  The reality is that this segment doesn't actually exist it has no buyers in it.  Seems intel is truly doomed trying to win segments that if they even exist aren't big enough to pay back their R&D even if the dominate them.,Negative
Intel,"To be fair this is not a clean room, just SMT assembly. Basically, soldering components. A lose hair might be a bit of a problem (kind of like in any factory), but his hair is tied and doesn't seem to be an issue.

Intel,"It’s crazy. I think Steve and GN are doing the lords work with their nonstop, accurate coverage of the absolute shit state of the computer component markets and the megacorps that perpetuate it.

Probably the same mfs that bought MKBHD’s wallpaper app lmfao",Negative
Intel,"Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket. To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of similar performance or even outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,B580 has 12gb of vram though,Neutral
Intel,"Sad that all of those are 8gb cards. Even if comparable or faster than the B580 aside from that, the lack of vram makes them far inferior products imo.",Negative
Intel,I just wish all of those options were more compelling tbh. I think what Steve was trying to say was that AMD and Nvidia have just half assed that market segment at the expense of the consumer. All these being 8gb cards for $250-$300 is kinda ridiculous in 2026. I’ll take a b580 over a 9060xt 8gb or 5060 any day of the week.,Negative
Intel,Go to r/PCMasterrace and they will downvote you into oblivion for even MENTIONING the possibility of gaming on a 5060 let alone 5050 XD,Negative
Intel,The title is just playing the YouTube algorithm game. It's stupid but they have to do it.,Negative
Intel,"> Love how 5050 is actually at msrp now cheapest b580 is $349+  Just an FYI but B&H has the [Acer Nitro B580 for $249.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1874395-REG/acer_dp_z4bww_p01_nitro_oc_arc_b580.html) and the [Intel Limited Edition model for $259.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1869297-REG/intel_31p06hb0ba_arc_b580_limited_edition.html). So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive
Intel,"I see b580 for € 260. That's VAT included. rtx5050 is similarly priced.     And i found $300 lot on US amazon.  Considering other post, maybe search better than 1 place or something.",Neutral

Intel,I do not know if the numbering scheme from my workplace is common across the industry but the smt assembly would be in a class 5 or 6 clean room and the fabrication itself would be a 1 or 2 class clean room,Neutral
Intel,"I think it still matters to a certain point, thats why everyone in the factory is wearing a hat. The Factory boss decided to roll RNG dice and say *""Fck it, that small hat is fine, even tho wearing it is pointless now; I'll just pray nothing bad happen*"". lol  What hilarious is when you think about what going through uninformed factory-employee's head, after they saw some guy(Steve) walk-into the factory like that. Definitely a lot of ""WTF"" moment going through their mind lmao.",Negative

Intel,This sub is genuinely weird. They complain about PCMR when the level of discourse here is much worse and a lot more mean spirited.,Negative
Intel,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative
Intel,"Might be just the thing for older machines and a GNU Linux (or BSD like) migration. Or as a pass through GPU to Jellyfin, Emby, or Plex for media transcoding. Edit: or Small form computing tied together with a iGPU enhancing game performance...",Neutral
Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.

Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
Intel,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
Intel,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
Intel,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
Intel,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
Intel,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
Intel,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
Intel,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
Intel,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
Intel,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
Intel,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral

Intel,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option.

Obviously remains to be seen how real those manufacturers claims are, but here’s hoping.",Neutral
Intel,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
Intel,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
Intel,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
Intel,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral

Intel,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
Intel,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
Intel,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
Intel,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
Intel,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
Intel,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
Intel,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
Intel,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Neutral

Intel,well said,Neutral
Intel,Too much listening to MLiD who has a boner for APUs,Negative
Intel,"Idk one can easily flip your statement. Panther lake coming in **2026** competing against continuing discounted 4050s prob less than 4060s. I don't dislike Panther Lake nor am I defending Strix Halo, but I wouldn't say your argument is a rather good one.",Neutral
Intel,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoiWv9BF7Q   It's already at least on par for reasonable power profiles unless you play stuck to the wall.,Neutral

Intel,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Positive
Intel,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
Intel,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same. So it also pulls 60W on battery.  Unless the manufacturer actually configured the device to simultaneously pull energy from the cord and battery under full load.",Neutral
Intel,About as much as we have PTL laptops,Neutral
Intel,"TB5 isn't a big deal, although I don't like that they have a numpad keyboard, and usually MSI speakers are terrible.",Negative
Intel,But can't you get a laptop with a 5060-5070 at that price?,Neutral

Intel,"> I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  I have a Strix Halo.  What you wrote is exactly what it is.  It's essentially a 9950x (so all P-cores) with a fat iGPU attached, and with a 4 channel memory controller instead of 2-channel.",Neutral
Intel,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
Intel,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
Intel,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral
Intel,Single Core is very important when Intel is doing these designs that lack P cores throughout. The cheapest X2 Elite has the same amount of P cores as the most expensive Panther Lake SKU,Neutral
Intel,"Qualcomm is already super close with Oryon V3...  Perf/Watt for that single thread isn't close I guess, but absolute performance is breathing down Apple's neck for sure.  Also, don't compare Geekbench scores on windows vs Linux/Apple/Android... Windows just does something negatively about it and the difference is 5-7% vs non-windows.",Neutral
Intel,>Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens.  I would be shocked if this has much to do with a large performance uplift. I imagine it would have to do more with rightsizing core area and power draw.,Negative
Intel,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
Intel,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
Intel,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral
Intel,"What is possible? PS5 uses GDDR6 instead of DRAM. And consoles are heavily subsidized by digital purchases. I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative

Intel,"140T (Arrow Lake) isn't the same as 140v (Lunar Lake) though, the former is usually quite a bit weaker and inconsistent in games despite slaying all the synthetics.",Neutral
Intel,"It is probably because the AIO was one of their most, if not the most recent RTX 4050 tested (March 17th 2025) which probably enabled them to compare in newer title like F1 25 in the article, as it has already been around for like 3 years while RTX 5050 was released last year and received more attention in its place overall. From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

If QC captures market share and reaches 10-15%, then Intel will start to sweat and then margins will be hit. I don't think QC gets anywhere near that till like 2028/2029.

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral

Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.

Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral

The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral

Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

Intel,"Intel already talked about this a couple months ago. It's not an announcement here, but it seems people are more interested in AMD and Nvidia news so those threads don't get as much traction.",Negative
Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative
Intel,"With a lot of PS3 games dipping to 20s, I guess we are just paying more attention to it now",Neutral
Intel,There was DF Clip of this exact question.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxsfT4c-F-Q,Neutral
Intel,They're more surgery stuttery.,Neutral
Intel,Everyone hates MLID,Neutral
Intel,Funny piece of lore. Why so?,Neutral
Intel,Who's MLID?,Neutral
Intel,If the end visuals are better who cares. we already did a lot of such things in engine just didnt tell the players about it. One in four frames actually rendering shadows is a thing for example. Heck some games go as bad as once a second shadow updates.,Negative
Intel,"Well, I think that most people (myself included) don't really care how it's done if the end result is looking good and feel good to play, off course something like 30fps based with MFG to 120 is bs, but I quite regularly use 60 -> 120 using frame gen because It feels okay input wise to me at 60, and the added visual smoothness is quite nice. So it all depends how it's implemented and talked about.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah i had to tap out a couple months back. it's a shame, they did great work, but i refuse to support ragebait.",Positive
Intel,"Doesn't help that there isn't any particular new hardware to review or anything new besides AI, the PC industry has hit stagnation in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"In other news, guy who is being served turds at restaurant loudly complains about receiving fat dooks instead of food.     *""man that guy is such a whiner""*",Negative
Intel,"No it didn’t sound like they were going to use the MS shader delivery program. Or no, they said they want to, but they have their own solution that they’ll launch before that.   And I also don’t think the MS solution is ready. The ROG ALLY XBOX also doesn’t have this feature already as far as I know",Negative
Intel,"> The Shader delivery program was launched on an AMD handheld  i assume you're referring to the steamdeck, which to my understanding was done by valve... so the point kinda stands, you just add valve to the preamble.",Neutral
Intel,"I dunno I remember many games, especially based on Quake engine, being buttery smooth if you could get to reasonable FPS",Neutral
Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral
Intel,MLID more like MID,Neutral
Intel,He’s been calling Tom a “snake oil salesman” for performance claims on Alchemist,Neutral
Intel,"Moore's Law is dead, he's a YouTuber who makes predictions and purports to have insider information from Nvidia/Intel/AMD but in reality he is better described as FanFiction for PC enthusiasts.",Negative
Intel,"I worry about things like latency.  Or what happens when you move suddenly, or fire, and the whole image falls apart.  If the hardware can't do it all yet, then wait a few years instead of using these... methods.  And just to be clear, I think very highly of  Mr. Tom 'TAP' Petersen; I'm just not liking where this is all heading.  Are you happy with Borderlands 4 or Outer Worlds 2?  If you are then we live in two different worlds.",Negative
Intel,"There's plenty of old stuff he needs to review. I've said it before but I will say it again and beat it like a drum: He STILL has not reviewed the 9060 XT 8GB for instance. Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative
Intel,No wonder that strategy has proved successful. There are a lot of people that only care about complaining and bitching. Which I get up to a point but it starts to feel childish and pathetic quickly.,Negative
Intel,"I love how reddit down votes you,  reddit posts all day complaining about the industry, GN does a video on it   Redditors ""whiney cry baby engagement farmers """,Negative
Intel,"Valve does have one on Steam, but Microsoft announced a store agnostic, eventually hardware vendor agnostic one launched with the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X last year.  It was supposed to be working already but there's no sign of it just like everything else Microsoft releases about gaming half-baked like their gaming UI, their attempt to unify upscaling, and Directstorage.   So I imagine they're referring to what Microsoft called ""Advanced Shader Delivery"" that they've done little with but name and announce to sell more Asus Pretend-Xbox's.",Neutral
Intel,I’m talking about the Xbox Ally as the other commented said,Neutral
Intel,We considered solid 60 or 75 smooth back then. Now at least I complain as soon as I can't stay above 100.,Neutral
Intel,"Shader compilation stutter is a PC problem that’s been especially bad in UE4 and 5 since the transition to DX12. Other types of stutter and bad frame rates used to be equally bad on consoles, or even worse in the 360/PS3 era.",Negative
Intel,Outer Worlds 2 is fairly consistent for a UE5 game. To me its just very heavy,Negative
Intel,"funny coming from MLID, notorious snake oil salesman",Neutral
Intel,"Eeeegh, considering MLID overall story - can see that, can see that.  OTOH usage of such terminology - snake oil salesman - reminds me of that very infamous Intel presentation...",Negative
Intel,You say that as if we will reduce our base frame rate. But the direction of travel is to use MFG to drive the 480Hz and above monitors that will become more and more common in the future.,Neutral
Intel,I dont like borderlands franchise and i havent played Outer Worlds 2 yet so i cannot comment on them from personal experience. However things like Reflex/Reflex2 has actually decreased latency for me.,Negative
Intel,"I havent really seen it as some sort of drama farm, I think a lot of GN's videos do show how bad the current computer hardware hobby is doing and Im glad someone is focusing on that",Negative
Intel,Whata wrong with calling companies out? Like redditors cry all day but stop at GN when the channel brings up issues within an industry.  Sorry a person isn't running their channel the way the reddit collective wants.,Negative
Intel,"honestly, i had completely forgotten that was a thing.   i wish i had more faith in microsoft to pull this off, but i remain skeptical in basically anything they try until proven otherwise.",Negative
Intel,"People on gaming forums used to go around insisting the human eye could not distinguish greater than 60fps.  It was accepted as gospel in many places/by many people.  Granted, that was in the age of CRTs and almost no one had actually seen >60, but funny to think back on.",Neutral
Intel,snake oil salesmen dont like competition.,Negative
Intel,"MLID aka ""RTX 50 super will be released november 2025""",Neutral
Intel,this just makes me like tom more,Positive
Intel,"Replace that 60 with 30. Yes, people insisted we could not see more than 30 even while playing on 85hz CRTs.",Neutral
Intel,"Meanwhile quake players kept dropping resolution to hit triple digit refresh rates :) But yeah, it's wild that 30 was the norm for so long on console",Neutral
Intel,That's far from the worst prediction he's missed.  Remember SMT4 for future Zen architectures? 24 and 32 cores on desktop Zen4? L4 cache for Zen 4?,Neutral
Intel,Which Tom?,Neutral
Intel,"console used to lock at 60, dont know why they choose to drop down to 30.",Negative
Intel,"Because when the hardware cant handle all the sprites, it slows everything down including game logic which was tied to frame rate back then. It happens in plenty of hardware from snes to arcade cabinet.",Neutral
Intel,"also happened the other way round, older games would run faster than they should because they tied it to framerate rather than delta time. This bad practice was so common you can still find studios like bethesda do this.",Negative
Intel,"for context, this G14 was the one that gave us [the first ever Geekbench scores for Panther Lake](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ocaslx/panther_lake_geekbench_leak_its_good/) over on r/hardware",Neutral
Intel,"The price probably wasn't going to be low enough compared with other SKUs.  In the past, Intel skuss with Iris HD etc were so expensive and were only included in $2000 ultrabooks. This is probably going to be same.",Negative
Intel,When I first learned about I was confused why it existed. Not surprised Asus decided to cancel it.,Negative
Intel,"It makes sense, a B390 only G14 kind of defeats the whole purpose of the Zephyrus, even as a base model.     Basically brings the GPU performance down to 3060 levels (actually a little worse than that), which is roughly 4 years ago at this point.",Negative

Intel,"It would have made _some_ sense, but the Arc B390 must’ve been real good. But as you say, with the raise in RAM prices, you can forget about it.  I wonder whether Intel themselves would pair a mid-range Panther Lake with a top-notch iGPU… It would make sense, since the high-end CPUs tend to have dGPUs.",Neutral
Intel,"For the Zephyrus you can also just disable the dGPU to game only on the iGPU, and the customers of the Zephyrus are minimum looking for a decently powerful dGPU",Neutral
Intel,I hope their plugged out power scheme is permanent and doesn't vary based on application,Negative
Intel,"> so what's the point of having a powerful GPU on a laptop if I got to plug in all the time  I have a laptop for travelling. I travel to places that have plugs, and I don't need to use a laptop while I am actually in transit.",Neutral
Intel,"It still pulls 60W (and apparently 80W, briefly) at full pelt...  That is to say an hour and a half battery life when gaming should be expected. It's not magic.",Neutral
Intel,Usb c powered gaming laptops are more common now. The new ideapad 5 pro with panther lake and 5060 (combined 110w system power) uses usb c exclusively,Neutral

Intel,"Useable, yes, but what customers of the Zephyrus are looking for, no.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and it gets pretty good battery life on that and in power saving mode/60fps screen mode. Like 8 hours. Best I've had on a gaming laptop- not a high bar, but it's nice to be able to take it into the living room and use it light a normal laptop instead of it dying instantly.",Positive
Intel,Still better than 45 minutes  Also it can obviously be put in a lower power mode to save battery while not hurting performance too drastically.,Positive
Intel,"The G14 used to have gtx1650, so not sure what do you mean.",Neutral
Intel,Which was the 5050 of that time which is significantly more powerful than panther lake's igpu.,Neutral

Intel,"The B580 has 200W TDP, in a perfect world and TDP scales linearly, the B770 would be 50% faster, that would put it around the 5060Ti/9060XT.  If the price also scales linearly, that would be around 375€, seeing that the 9060XT is going for 350€ now, it's gonna be tough competition.",Neutral
Intel,Im really looking forward to panther lake X. 4-4-4 core configuration and Xe3 iGPU with sr-iov is perfect for running a Linux-Windows mixed vm environment without having to get a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU for virtualisation.,Positive
Intel,I hope the Linux driver support and performance is good in these,Positive
Intel,"Intel ARC needs to maintain their momentum. They have an excellent pricing strategy and genuinely compelling features, it's time they released a card that competes in the midrange. And no, I don't count the A770. As a B580 owner, increased ARC adoption rates will be sure to benefit all cards in the range, so I really hope that intel is committed for the long-haul here.

Intel,"Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds. That however will mean a bigger die and viability might be questionable (considering they're already massive for the performance).",Negative
Intel,"Price doesn't scale linearly because die sizes make defects scale quadratically. so pricing is the same, 2 50mm\^2 dies are cheaper than 1 100mm\^2 die     However in GPUs there is a fixed cost for every GPU so there is a sweet spot",Neutral

Unless Battlemage is seriously memory bandwidth-limited, it should be almost 50% more performant.  The only question is die size.

Intel,"The B50 is not a gaming GPU and actually underperforms in gaming tasks compared the the B580. They need to have an actual range of cards, not just a budget option, and even more budget option, and a server/workstation GPU. The B770 is essential to compete in the midrange",Negative

Intel,"> Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds.

They can't really afford not to use every bit of die space they have for all that its worth.",Negative
Intel,"Battlemage doesn't have the ability to add more Xe cores per render slice, this is something Intel has changed for Xe3. The BMG-G31 will have 128 ROPs, the same as an RX 9070 XT, or more than an RTX 5080.",Neutral

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.

It would also strongly indicate that Intel’s 18A node indeed offers significantly better energy efficiency than TSMC's N3B.",Negative

Intel,"Couple of subtests leverage some new arm vector instructions and get huge scores, but those have limited influence to the overall score.

One difference is that since geekbench is distributed as binary it’s compiled more directly for apple architectures specifically while others use more generic targets. But that has very limited effect.",Neutral
Intel,But they have a gpu compute test too,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Negative
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,Fair. If your on a tight budget. Consider some of the RDNA3 AMD cards as well. I mean if your looking at a 3 generation old 3060 anyway. Something like the 7600 XT 16gb might be on the market where you are at a good price. Its probably 20% or so faster then a 3060.,Positive
Intel,"Check your GPU utilization in the game. If it's near 100%, then a GPU upgrade is the best option. But, I encourage you not to buy the RTX 3050. Try to get at least a 3060.",Neutral
Intel,Intel has GPUs for a while they got a pretty good budget option too (just some problems with it though) called the Intel arc b580. Anyways upgrading to AM5 is not viable as its Ramageddon so ram prices are horrendous rn. I recommend checking out the 5600xt or 5800XT CPU. As for the GPU try looking for a 9060xt 8gb or 16gb it's a pretty budget option that'll do you well. If you have a budget of around 200-300 get rtx 3060. Before all this though what's your PSU wattage,Neutral
Intel,"If you're open to getting used, might be able to upgrade both. Ryzen 5600 are ~100-120 USD used on Ebay or on Aliexpress (or look around for a local seller on Facebook Marketplace or /r/hardwareswap) and it drops right into your board to replace the 2600. Pair that with an Arc B580 (~250, maybe less used) and you've got a pretty solid setup.",Neutral

Intel,What speed is that RAM?,Neutral
Intel,"Keep the Ryzen 7 2700, B450 mb, 32g ram and get a GPU. You said the Intel B570 but for a little more you can get Intel B580 if your PSU and MB support it. You also said I5 14400 but then you would need another Motherboard.",Neutral

Intel,"Any 5000-series CPU would be a *massive* upgrade, however… GPUs specifically will see massive price hikes & shortages in the next couple months. So it might actually be the last time you can snag a cheap used GPU.  Forget the 3050, a 3060Ti is an excellent value under $200. If you can find a 12GB version, you’ll be especially glad you did. I’d recommend a 4060 for the same price range, but your motherboard is most likely PCI gen 3, so a 30-series card is your best bet.

Intel,5060 is faster for arc raiders natively and considering the feature advantage I would def go for it.  Although keep in mind if you go over the 8gb vram limit the 9060 xt will handle that better and is faster on average just not in arc raiders,Positive
Intel,Get the 5060! It has a better feature set like better upscaling and better Ray Tracing! You also don't have to deal with crappy AMD drivers which I have experienced and many AMD RX 9000 series users are also experiencing! You have better peace of mind with the Nvidia GPU!,Positive

Intel,"The 9060XT is the stronger card. At 1080p don't even think about the 16Gb. Traditionally, AMD updates their cards and the performance grows more and more over time. Personally, I'd get the AMD card. The ""benefits"" you get from Nvidia cards are useless at a 5060 level of performance. The pure raster advantage of the 9060XT will last you longer",Positive
Intel,Arc Raiders came out 3 months ago. You're going to own that GPU for years. Buying a GPU for one specific game seems like a bad idea.,Negative
Intel,You will massively regret buying an 8gb card if you ever want to use a higher resolution than 1080p. The 9060xt 16gb is worth it. Better to save up and put off the purchase than to buy something you will be disappointed with.,Negative
Intel,"There's a very good reason to not get an 8GB card though. It's just not worth it at this point in time. Its longevity is severely limited, do yourself a favour and just avoid any 8GB graphics cards.",Negative
Intel,Its not a 20% perfomance increase. It is the difference between 10fps and 80fps when you go to 1440p or your 4k TV.  See https://youtu.be/7LhS0_ra9c4?si=z9VGzFIq3qbLEMc_,Neutral
Intel,Seems I've been a victim of cherry picking then my bad I've just ran with it from what I've seen with most content creators. Still 9060xt is cheaper for them so they should get it,Negative
Intel,"I'm surprised how close the 5060 is to the 9060xt, 8gb. The both play games well at 1080p so most people will be happy with either and yes vram an issue but I'd you don't play many AAA games this won't be an issue, we also can't ignore ram shortage this will affect consoles etc in the future.",Neutral
Intel,"Im glad i could help, the advantage of going Nvidia is DLSS, it is superior to FSR and it is implemented in way more games.  It will serve you well, i also own it and i like it",Positive
Intel,The 16 GB model will be the 5060 Ti if I am not wrong! The 5060 Ti is around 15-16% faster than the 5060 but if you can afford the 5060 Ti 16GB then I would suggest you to surely get it as it will be relevant for much longer in the future and Nvidia is going to stop production of the 16gb 5060 ti this year going from the rumours!,Positive
Intel,No AMD drivers are still buggy!

Intel,"Oh so true i tought the 5060 was the cheaper one ,he should get the 9060xt",Neutral
Intel,At 1080 both of them can play absolutely any AAA game without any problem ( medium is needed in indiana jones ) but the rest can run at high,Negative
Intel,"Yes, that still seems to be the consensus very much. Better upscaling and drivers.",Positive
Intel,"The 5060 Ti 16 GB is ~$630 here. Think the 9070 (non xt) would give better performance for that price range ($650 where I live). The pricing ladder in my market, I tell you! 😅",Neutral
Intel,I own one buddy. I have never had a single issue with my 9070xt. The only people posting to this subreddits are people having issues that the overwhelming majority of people do not have. It’s biased by the nature of what it is .   If amd gpus had driver issues you would see big publications talking about them but you don’t. You are propagating a myth.  You’re also conveniently ignoring the disastrous 50 series launch drivers for NVIDIA.,Negative
Intel,"Curious - in what kind of situations does the 5060 run into vram limitations in your experience with it?

Intel,Yes he is interested in using his 4k TV at lower settings and framerate. It will not be playable with a 8gb gpu.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah i also moved to nvidia even though it is not allways the best price for performance because my last 2 AMD cards ( 5700xt and 6650xt ) could not run God Of War at all no matter the video settings or resolution, the game kept dropping to 30 fps, and it is a common issue with Amd and god of war games and they still have not fixed it.  There are more issues like this, some are fixable if you google the solution, some are not and after the thing with god of war i decided to give up on amd for now, they also didnt add FSR4 to previous gen GPU s ( like the 7000 series) , while Nvidia gave DLSS 4.5 even to the first RTX cards.",Negative
Intel,Then stick to 5060! For almost double the price it is not worth it!,Negative
Intel,You are welcome to make your assumptions and share your own experience but I can only speak based on my experience with them and what I observe from my reddit scrolls! I switched to the Green Side and won't be going for a new Radeon GPU anytime soon.,Neutral
Intel,"You can play Arc Raider at max settings and you wont run out of Vram, personally  i never ran out of vram because i dont allways play the latest games ( i play at 1080p )  In the Game Indiana Jones ( which is a very bad optimised game )you have to set the settings to medium to not run out of vram and i think in the new Doom you have to use high, thats it, in some future released games you might have to use high/medium instead of ultra.  When you run out of vram the game gets very bad frame drops.  I play Cyberpunk on a mix of high and very high i think and i dont have any issues with vram for example, same for BF6.  At 4k resolution the vram issues appear in newer titles",Neutral
Intel,At 1080p you will almost never run into a VRAM issue and Nvidia cards are also more efficient in VRAM utilisation! They are also much more power efficient i.e. they will consume less power for the same level of performance which saves some electricity while also giving your power supply more headroom!,Positive
Intel,Can you go find a 5700xt and run that until you've saved for a  16GB card?  If you ever wanna move to the TV or even a better monitor 8GB is gonna be out gunned real fast.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh right yeah 😅  I don’t even own a TV, that wouldn’t cross my mind.",Negative
Intel,"Haha what, more power efficient?",Positive
Intel,Not available here. What about a 7700xt for ~$380 (vs 9060xt 16gb @~$500) or a 7600 xt for $270 vs (5060 @~$500)?  Used market is not ideal here. They're either overpriced or they get snapped up in minutes.,Negative
Intel,"Regardless, the 8gb models on some modern games run out of VRAM at 1080p. I assume most spend hundreds of euros to have a useful product for several years, not just a single.",Neutral

Intel,">30c ish at idle to 60-80c under load.  That sounds normal my guy intel i9s are well known power hogs, the 200-300w that thing consumes will generate that kind of heat.

Intel,"Start with setting up your PL1/2 for the capacity of your AIO. If it is set to standard, 4096W, you are going to have problems cooling that thing. Start with 253/253 standard Intel would be 125/253/304A and keep lowering that until there is no more thermal throttling. After that you can fine tune with undervolt etc.  And ofcourse check AIO mounting, pump, fluid.",Neutral
Intel,For both 12th and 13th gen you can do the following:  - turn hyperthreading off - enable only 8 ecores - Set a negative voltage offset of - 0.050  Play games for a couple of hours if no crashes then decrease offset by another 0.025 (I.e. 0.075). And keep going till you find the lowest voltage without crashes. This will increase 1% lows tremendously in games too.   Once you're stable and if temps are still too high (thermal throttle) then you can reduce clock speed by 100hz and keep doing it till you're happy. Reducing by 200mhz doesn't hurt gaming performance.  Benchmark a CPU limited game (or make it CPU limited by lowering the resolution) before you start so you can see the gains.,Neutral
Intel,not a single mention of voltages?,Neutral
Intel,"I ordered a new case and a 360mm AIO which is supposed to be here tomorrow, since my current case doesn't support a 360 on the top, I plan to move everything over sometime this weekend.

Intel,"Go for AM4 or LGA1700 so you can use DDR4 instead of the insanely expensive DDR5. Then sell the stick you have now and reap the profits, or keep it for if you ever decide to upgrade in the future to a DDR5 platform. DDR4 is also still just a more stable technology in general in my experience. Older platform boards and chips will also be cheaper than AM5, while still enabling you to build a massively overpowered system for your use case. You can also put that money saved into other things in your life, or into a more powerful GPU like a B580 or 9060XT.  For example, instead of a Ryzen 7600, I'd recommend a 5700 for about the same price. Somewhat slower individual cores, but there are more of them (you're unlikely to notice the difference with the games you play), and your board and RAM will be a lot cheaper (you can also get much better memory than that for the price with DDR4, that DDR5 you have is bottom of the barrel stuff meant for office PCs, not for gaming). A nice Gen 4 SSD isn't too expensive still, and then you can use the difference for a better GPU, or as I mentioned before, to put to use elsewhere.  Also, if you use a good board with a second x16 PCIe slot, you can use that RX480 as a Lossless Scaling frame generation card. Or render the game on the 480 and use the 1050ti as a frame generation card.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, those boot times and random freezes scream failing HDD. Your old drive is likely on its last legs, and that’s probably what’s killing your internet connection too when the OS hangs.  About the new build: Going AM5 with the 7600 is a smart move. It’s a massive jump. But since you’re buying DDR5, try to get a 6000MHz kit instead of 4800MHz. Ryzen 7000 series really needs that extra speed to shine, and 4800MHz will actually hold your CPU back more than you think.  Also, just a heads-up on the PSU: that CiT FX Pro is pretty bottom-tier. Since you’re buying a nice ROG Strix board and a modern CPU, I’d spend a bit more on a reliable power supply (like a Corsair or Seasonic) just to be safe.  Swap to that RX 480 for now—it’ll definitely beat your 1050 Ti while you save for a modern GPU. Once you install Windows on that NVMe SSD, the PC is going to feel like a rocket ship compared to your old OptiPlex",Negative
Intel,Nothing wrong with that at all.  A nice GPU upgrade that's reasonably priced would bea Radeon 5700XT.  Ebay has them for $150 or so and it's still a very capable card.  Don't get too worked up about biggest and baddest. Only thing beside the GPU I would focus on would be RAM I'd want at least 16 and probably 32,Positive

Intel,"Yeah I was thinking that, with the price of ram right now, I'm going to get 16gb and keep an eye out for cheaper sticks.",Neutral
Intel,"I disagree here. A good strategy / upgrade path I've used over the years is to sink around $1000 into a quality build minus graphics card, then 4/5 years later sink around $300/$400 into a decent current-gen graphics card. Then a few years later repeat the process (using the old graphics car with the new build.)   This obviously won't work if you want to play AAA titles on ultra settings, but for those of us without thousands to burn on gaming it's a good plan if you don't mind turning down settings a little.",Neutral
Intel,"Its just because I don't want to have to upgrade twice my gpu works fine on most things at low settings but the daily tasks like word and Discord it struggles on quite a bit. and my internet speed is stuck at 10mbs as the motherboard has a bug in it what intel never fixed.  I was going to upgrade the GPU later in the year anyways, this is like in the next month purchases. sorry didn't make that very clear.",Negative
Intel,"Sorry I didn't make it clear, my 9070 does have an ssd (swapped it over last year) but it didn't make a difference on boot times really at all. a bit annoyed as I went through the process of copying my data to it and I fucked it up and lost everything lol.     Good thinking, the PSU is just what I brought middle of last year for my current pc has the PSU in that one died and I had no money lol. I'll keep that noted thank you  Yeah the pc is going to be a bit WIP, my current pc is dying so just trying to scrap parts together in the next month before it dies. saying I only need to buy the motherboard and cpu now and I'll have a useable pc, the rest I can just purchase in the next couple of months.

Intel,"Yes - I was going to reply that I am currently running Arc Raiders (such a great game!) on a GTX 960 on medium settings, and it runs perfectly with no issues.  Definitely limited in that you can't run 'ultra' settings, but to say ""struggling with almost any modern game"" is a bit of an overstatement.",Positive

Intel,"You're definitely not wrong! I'm a very patient gamer though, and most often games I am buying (unless multiplayer, which I rarely play anyway) are anywhere from 3-10 years old, so for me this method is perfect.

Intel,"I mean it takes me 5 minutes longer than my friends to load in but it does work really well, runs better on my pc that fornite",Positive
Intel,Very true - same with phones I upgrade every 5 years to appreciate how fast the new tech can be.  And yeah my graphic card was old when I brought it 6 years ago. I’ll rather have a faster start up now tbh if I brought a graphic card it would be held back by my pc anyways,Positive
Intel,"If the B580 has good performance in the game that you are interested in then it can be a good option. However, in some games there are driver overhead issues. So you cant trust every benchmark with a 7800x3d/9800x3d to estimate the GPU performance. In some games performance is reduced with a Ryzen 5 5600 for example. If this has been fixed in your games (or you have a stronger CPU) then the b580 is a good choice.",Positive
Intel,The b580 is just the overall better card. Intel may be new to the dedicated graphics market but they have been making their own GPUs for almost 20 years at this point and have the experience of supporting them through driver updates for many years,Positive
Intel,b580 cause vram,Neutral
Intel,"How much is the 8GB 9060 in your country?  But regardless, the B580 is better for simple gaming if you can pair it with a strong CPU.  The RTX 4060 is better outside of gaming, but also works better with a weaker resolution. DLSS also helps with higher resolutions.",Positive
Intel,"Thanks everyone for the help, I really appreciate it!",Positive
Intel,> B580 is better for simple gaming if you can pair it with a strong CPU  i pair the b580 with the 225f which is an entry level cpu and they work well. gpu 100% and cpu 33% usually when gaming,Positive
Intel,Sadly it costs $350 here. I considered that too but it's out of the budget. Btw thanks!,Negative
Intel,"The 225F is a very current CPU, there are many people who will try to pair this with something like an i3-6100 or Ryzen 1400.",Neutral
Intel,Used rtx 3060ti for 250 or less. Fantastic value card now a days.,Neutral
Intel,"So the 9th gen is a bit of a weird CPU right now, you do have a couple of decent upgrade options, but also you cannot go past the 9th gen without a new motherboard. Also the 9th gen is quickly coming up on 6 years old now as well.   My affordable advice would be to grab a 9700k and a better CPU cooler, then you can start to worry about the GPU which is very PSU dependent anyways. Without knowing the PSU I cant really make a suggestion anyways.   But the truth is, I would almost start fresh. New mobo, cpu, PSU and GPU. It would be more pricy, but also a far better use of your money than dumping it into a system that will be too slow to run new games in just a year or two.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, really both kinda. 6500 XT is a notorious shite GPU but the games you play are CPU bound so a new CPU would do wonders. Budget is needed here.",Neutral
Intel,"I have the ASRock H310CM-HDV with an i5-9400. The beta BIOS will add Smart Access Memory (a.k.a., resizable bar). This may improve GPU performance...depending on game.  An i9-9900 is in the $200+ range. An i7-9700 is in the $100+ range. The i9-9900's \~24% performance gain is questionable for \~100% increase in price. There are other options between your i3-9100f and the i7-9700...  Before dropping Benjamins on a new GPU, consider an overclock and undervolt of your 6500 XT:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSLrvoejhg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSLrvoejhg)  If the OC/UV yields ""good enough"" improvements, then you might be able to bypass the premiums being demanded in the current PC component market.",Neutral
Intel,"All the games you play avoid the problem of having a weak but modern gpu very well. Assuming you dont suddenly decide to play something more graphically intensive i reccomend upgrading your cpu seeing how it feels, then upgrading your gpu. The immediate option that comes to mind is the i5 9400f. It should be an approximate 25%-30% improvement in most of the games like cs2 due to the added cores, threads and clock speed compared to that fairly weak i3 cpu. Then you could do something like an RX 6600 for $120 if findable, if not I usually reccomend the 3060 12gb as a braindead midrange option still able to play anything, it's about 200.",Neutral
Intel,Get a 12th or 13th Intel i5 CPU and a decent GPU like the 5060 Ti or the 9060XT,Neutral
Intel,"What is your budget for upgrades?  Your GPU is currently being held back by your platform. The 6500XT only has PCIe x4, and LGA 1151 only has PCIe 3.0. 3.0x4 bottlenecks the card pretty badly, going from on par with an RX 580 to worse than an RX 570. Getting onto a newer platform with PCIe 4.0 would improve both your CPU and GPU.",Negative
Intel,"What you could/should upgrade depends entirely on budget. The CPU is nearly the slowest 9th gen Intel chip, so an upgrade there would help a lot. The ""Best In Slot"" CPU is the i9-9900K but those go for nearly $200 on eBay. You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game. The GPU is also the slowest of the 6000 series. As far as new GPUs go, the Intel Arc B580 12GB at $250-$300 or the Radeon RX 9060XT 16GB at $380-$400 are best bang for the buck on the cheaper side, your options really open up on the used market. Go to the [Techpowerup specs page](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6500-xt.c3850) and check out the Relative Performance of your card with faster ones. I would upgrade to something at least 200% relative performance or higher if you can afford it. Between the GPU and CPU, I'd say the GPU upgrade should take priority over CPU. While a much newer GPU might be bottlenecked by the 9100F, its vastly superior performance will leave the 6500XT in the dust. GTX 1080ti (\~$150) RTX 2080ti (\~240) RTX 3060ti (\~$220-250) RX 6750XT ($280-350) RX 6800 (\~$300) RTX 3080 (\~$350) all examples of decent used options that are considerably more powerful than the 6500.",Neutral
Intel,Adding a 9700K isn’t gonna fix the fact the GPUs being bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  An R5 3600 and a cheap B550 board would probably cost not much more than an 9700K and improve the GPUs performance quite a bit. It would still work with the 16GB DDR4 they already have.,Negative
Intel,I have seen many videos on how it is a bad card I haven’t had no problems so far but definitely on my list,Negative
Intel,LGA 1700 isn’t worth recommending at all. DDR4 performance has aged terribly because newer games are more memory demanding. DDR4 boards have also gone up in price a lot.   HUB revisited the Ryzen 5000 series last week and included a 12400F on DDR4 and DDR5 for comparison (https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=NbuCRlSV4uhHOzlv) - the 12400F on DDR4 performs closer to an R5 5500 nowadays than the R5 5600 it used to compete with.,Neutral
Intel,"I have not seen anywhere near that level of bottleneck from even this level of pcie mismatch. Cool you have pet issues, but this is about the cheapest possible options for the platform (and use case) at hand.

Intel,https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rx-6500-xt-pcie-gen3-gen4-tested,Neutral
Intel,"What? A lot of the review coverage for the 6500XT was about how bad the PCIe bottleneck is. The 6400 and 6500XT are unique in that they’re PCIe x4, even current lower-end cards like the Arc B570 and RTX 5050 are PCIe x8  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-pci-express-scaling/28.html TPU saw a 24% drop from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p  https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/ Techspot saw a 22% drop in averages and 25% drop in lows from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p   I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s even worse nowadays, games demand more VRAM now than they did 4 years ago. More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.  If you don’t know what you’re talking about, don’t comment lol",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m not stupid.  You are far better off going for Zen 3 over anything on LGA 1700.   The R5 5600(X) performs as well with DDR4 as the 12400(F) does with DDR5.  Used they both go for ~$100-120, new both are ~$170 right now. AM4 boards tend to be cheaper and the RAM is the exact same.  Why would you spend more on LGA 1700 to get worse performance?",Neutral
Intel,"My real-world experience with low-end cpu power and this mismatch on those titles is 10%. It isnt worse than having that i3 does to cpu-bound situations. Upgrading a bad platform is probabaly not his best price to dollar, but it is the nuanced situation he's in. if he can sell what he has for the price it goes for, going ryzen is always correct. However his cpu and all the others here are bad. If he can simply get a better part price on a single chip, he can get equivalent value from the upgrade compared to going ryzen.",Negative
Intel,You can get an i5 13600k with better performance than a 5800x. Also it is difficult to find the AM4 X3D CPUs these days so the intel route makes sense. He can later upgrade to a 14900k even which no AM4 CPU can match in terms of performance,Positive
Intel,"Weren’t you recommending upgrading to a 9400F?  Sure, the 9100F might be the limiting factor right now, but you’re still gonna hit the same PCIe bottleneck. It’s just gonna be more pronounced.",Neutral
Intel,"13th gen pricing is crap so I’ll use 14th gen for comparison, it’s basically the same  14600KF is $245 new and $180-200 used. It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.  Going Intel over AMD would cost at least $60 extra and most of the performance gains you would see using DDR5 on the 14600KF would be wiped out using DDR4",Negative

Intel,"There is a high-end bias with this platform, like any. It helps a lot to understand that budget systems fall within their spec, it is only the highest-end and lowest-end options of this era that stretch the pcie issue... there are cycles of alarmist narritives in all media. That one is old news that likely shouldnt have been printed imo.",Neutral
Intel,You’re going to hit the large PCIe bottleneck the moment the CPU isn’t terrible. It’s not gonna take much of a CPU upgrade for a GPU worse than an RX 570 to become the issue.,Negative
Intel,Im pretty sure a 9400f isnt gonna cause an issue here man... ive used this platform before. Then his pc is worth something...,Negative
Intel,Youre giving me nothing against the clear narritives youre following over substance of experience with this shitty level of cpu performance.,Negative
Intel,"Do you respect at all the starting position he is in or are u just an advice salesman? Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct. The only bad advice here wastes more time and money than his original choice of platform already sealed. Also ur just wrong about pcie bottlenecks im pretty sure",Neutral
Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0. That’s not opinion, that’s fact. That loss is going to be the same regardless of how good or bad your CPU is as long as the CPU isn’t the bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,I genuinely wonder what u get living in the idealized world where pcie 3.0 sucks ass below the highest-end 4.0 products and visa-versa. My dad was rly into the ideas of mearsheimer and I luckily biocontained his ass before that fkers gone and made the meme rounds again. You listen to Armand Hammer?,Negative
Intel,"Yea. Your advice is fine and wasnt the target of my statements, I added the last comment as proof I agree a platform swap is a totally good option. He doesnt even need to change his cooler for a 9400f and can then get a normal gpu for a similar value to his current one. This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement.

Intel,"Honestly there’s no “wrong” GPU to slot in with the rest of your build (although getting something lower tier than the options you stated would probably be a bit of a waste)  The 9800X3D gives you so much headroom that unless you’re going for crazy high FPS @ 1080p (which you’re not), it will be more than enough to pair with any GPU.   I think the 5070 Ti and 9070 XT are the most common “sweet spot” for value/performance atm, but if you ever see a good deal on a 5080 then that’ll obviously be a bit better.   My main word of advice would be, don’t stretch your GPU budget too far at the expense of the monitor. You don’t have to go crazy or anything, but a quality monitor will improve your experience quite a bit more than a few % better performance from the GPU imo",Neutral
Intel,"Without productivity needs, it'll come down to how long you plan on keeping it. If you plan on keeping it for 5 years or less, the 9070 XT if the price is cheaper. If you plan on keeping it for more than 5 years, I'd lean towards the 5070 TI since Nvidia seems to have better long term support.",Neutral

You probably will be fine with either, but that's what turned me off from AMD.

Intel,"Basically the Nvidia feature suite. FSR4 is good but not as good as DLSS4 and now we have DLSS 4.5 which is another step up.   DLSS frame generation is also better than the counterpart from FSR but many people may not want to use frame generation at all.  If you play any ray traced title, although 9079XT does run these games pretty much as fast as 5070TI, the image quality will be worse than 5070TI because AMD just has way worse ray reconstruction (even the new FSR ray construction exclusive to the new CoD game is still a lot worse than the Nvidia counterpart). 9070XT also performs worse than 5070TI in path traced game.  But I am not sure about things like driver stability. I know it is something AMD had been accused a lot in the past but from my own experience the driver for GeForce 50 series at June/July last year was downright horrible, like games literally freeze at unacceptable occurrences. It has been largely fixed at this point but some of the issue remains. Like forcing anisotropic filtering on still causes artifacts in many games",Neutral
Intel,"I don’t know a ton about the current market but I just got a 5070ti a week ago at microcenter and both were at msrp but my understanding is for the extra 150$ (at msrp) you’re paying the nvidia tax ofcourse but other than that slightly better dlss support in games and driver support over the years based off what I’ve read, then frame gen which you certainly don’t need but for me it means I can stretch the life of the card for 2-3 years longer and jump up to 4k if I want to. Native performance is basically identical so really you can’t go wrong between saving money and frame gen I’d say it depends how long and how hard you’re going to be pushing the card.",Neutral

Intel,"Anyone saying “little to not” is misleading you.  If you are comparing to something like a 14700K, the 12400 is a big bottleneck, even at 1440p and 4K.    As soon as you turn on upscaling like DLSS, you’re making yourself more CPU limited.  DLSS Quality at 1440p would be somewhere around 980p, so take a look at 1080p benchmarks for an idea of the potential performance difference.",Negative

There were some 5070 Ti models for £750 last week, but looks like they’re going up in price now, but that CPU and GPU combo total price should be about the same price as a 5080",Negative
Intel,"I'm using a i5 12400f with a 5070ti so almost the same as you, i did overclock and undervolt mine so might be even somewhat closer in performance 3075mhz with 0.925mv to you.   I do have 2k and 4k texture mods installed and multiple other mods so maybe the fps i get may not be what you see on vanilla cyberpunk and even slightly higher for vanilla.   Yes you will still be cpu limited in cyberpunk for me 1440p no ray tracing or PT i get 70-100fps the 70fps is the extreme dips and this is with every setting maxed except for crowd density at low   I also pulled up intel present mon and took a look at cpu busy and gpu busy this tells me how quickly one is sending information to the other, generally you want the cpu busy and gpu busy to be the same so that one is sending and completing the instructions at the same time and speed.   So with my hardware/mods and settings my cpu busy was 8ms and gpu busy was 6.5ms so my gpu was definitely waiting on my cpu for a bit.   With pathtracing on i dropped down to about 50-60fps.   Keep in mind though this is with quite a few texture mods and them being either 2k or 4k and also this is with preset M.   I'm currently getting the i5 14600kf arriving in 1-2 days since i want better shader compilation times as well since dear lord it takes a while for some.  Arc raiders while i haven't played the game i'm pretty sure as like any other live service online fps game will be quite cpu intensive rather than gpu intensive based on their style of graphics and how it's done so you should be limited by the i5 12400 as well as for how much sorry i don't have any data for you.",Neutral

Intel,"Hi op, I recently upgraded to a 5070ti and also have a 12400f.  Im on 3200mhz of ddr4 ram and playing at 1440p as well.  In some games like Arc Raiders, God of War, and Control, everything is perfect. GPU utilization is 99%.  However, im seeing a number of issues in several games. For instance, CP2077 has my GPU utilization at 65-70% and at ultra preset, no RT or dlss, im getting 80fps, while I see others with this gpu get 120. I know its a cpu botleneck bec when I leave the city and go to open areas, the utililization jumps to 99% and im getting like 120-130 at times even.  Likewise, several games like Space Marine 2, Outer Worlds 2, Spider Man Remastered, and more all sit at like 70-85% GPU utilization. Delta Force is at 59% (still 144fps tho) , Helldivers 2 sitting at 50% GPU utilization and a terrible 60 fps average. Starfield bounces from 60%-80% in the Jameson area and and gives me 60fps on average. Some drops to 55 fps too.  Whats more, DLSS options make no difference at all because of the bottleneck.  I can go from DLAA to DLSS Ultra performance without gaining any extra fps. This is a massive bad point considering how nice DLSS is these days.  Even among the games that give me 99% gpu utilization, Arc Raiders is the only that gives me DLSS performance gains. That game is just beautiful, giving me 100+ at cinematic settings, native res.   But for the other games, I literally have a 13600kf ready to be opened and installed (waiting on the cooler).  With a 5080, you are def going to see some bottleneck. So def consider a 13600kf/14600kf (they both identical in perf so get whichever is cheaper)",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah I am looking at my current options of upgrading to something like a 14600kf, which I think would solve my problems?

Intel,"Yeah the 5070ti I was looking at (msi gaming trio) is around £920, compared to like £1240 of the Rtx 5080. I'm just paranoid if I didn't go for that extra bump that I'd regret it later. If I went for the 5070ti, I could definitely afford the new cpu (like a 14700kf or such) in one go too.",Neutral
Intel,"This is a really helpful, thank you so much. Can I ask, with your current combo how is your general performance in whichever games you play please? I am considering dropping to a 5070ti and a cpu upgrade instead.  As for arc raiders performance, on the max settings, it's still capping out my fps with dlss balanced at around 60 (although I'm using fsr 2x fg), as it has global illumination and stuff so I do think while there are moments I'm cpu limited there's also very intense graphical stuff, but if I upgraded gpu it would definitely be held back more by the cpu",Positive
Intel,"Thank you so much, this is incredibly useful. Where I am you actually can't get 13600s (or any 13th gen), so I was thinking to do as you said, and get a 14600k, or 14700k, though the latter is like 50% more for hardly any gain.  But thank you so much, esp for the arc raiders ones as I always felt it might be cpu limiting but it's good to know it's more gpu.  (also this is completely irrelevant, but have you tried the frame gen in anything yet? I've tried things like fsr frame gen and lossless scaling and typically don't experience much issues with them or mind, and I can only imagine how good nvidias one will be)",Positive
Intel,Its the 3rd best GPU on the market with a 4 year old budget CPU. There is absolutely going to be a noticeable bottleneck in many games,Positive
Intel,"So yes, your board would support up to 14th gen Intel CPUs, and looks to have a high quality VRM, so shouldn't struggle at all with even the highest end CPUs.  I'd suggest grabbing the GPU and seeing how it performs in the games you play, and looking into upgrading the CPU if some aren't meeting your expectations.   The 14400 isn't much of an upgrade over the 12400, but you can currently get a a 14600kf for ~$220 US, which is a notable upgrade over both the 12400 and 12600.",Positive
Intel,"Pricey that one, I’ve been using the cheaper Gigabyte Windforce 5070 Ti with no issues, sure there’s no fancy lighting but it seems dead quiet. Running it with a 13900K and never had any performance hiccups with Red Dead 2 and Cyberpunk at 1440p Ultrawide.  Amazon have the MSI GAMING Trio 5070 Ti for £840 atm and some cheaper on their Used Like New option. You’d still be looking at like £400 more for a 15% - 20% performance increase.  I guess if go all out for the 5080 and do end up needing to upgrade your CPU, then you can get a few hundred if you sell your 3080 and use the funds from that.",Neutral
Intel,"Games i play or played, final fantasy 7 rebirth, Expedition 33, kcd2, alan wake 2, the last of us part 1, space marine 2 all of these is with quality setting and preset M   Final fantasy 7 rebirth 66% resolution scaling (this game doesn't have balanced weirdly so you're only able to set 33, 50, 66 and 100%) at 66% i'm roughly at 115-130fps. (Also do note i have some 4k texture mods installed).   E33 is about the same quality setting at 90-100fps no frame gen.   kcd2 unfortunately i haven't had time to play it so i can only give you starting area fps which is about 100-120fps, it'll probably tank like 15-25fps once you get to kuttenberg with the amount of npcs they have.   alan wake 2 is about 80-95fps in the nursing home, i don't have a save to load into the more intensive area which is about the forest area near the start of the game.   The last of us part 1 is 90-105fps.   Space marine 2 is where you will struggle abit with the i5 12400, during small fights and running you will be about 80-90fps but once you start going into the big battles you will drop to about 60-70fps.   Oh for when BF6 was in the testing phase i was getting about 85-100fps during that play session not sure if this helps with anything for you.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, id get the 14600k then. It's more than fine for a 5080/5070ti.  Yes, Arc runs perfectly as is.  And yes, frame gen has been incredible, honestly. While the messaging about how it's useless when you're below 60fps is accurate, it is actually beautiful if you like having high fps.  For example, in Outer Worlds 2, my FPS in the town area drops to 54-57 fps. However, multi frame gen, gives me a very comfortable high refresh experience. Likewise frame gen in arc raiders, space marine 2, and indiana jones feel really good.  I also have the Lossless scaling app and honestly, Nvidia frame gen is several times better. I remember testing out lossless scaling in several games and the only game where it felt nice was in Kingdom Come Deliverance 1. However, in games like helldivers, the input lag was very noticable even if you had 60fps base.  Here's another amazing part about 5000 series. Smooth motion. I discovered it only recently and if you weren't aware, its the driver side implementation of frame gen. With the nvidia app, I can turn it on in almost any game, including old ones like control and games like Enshrouded which dont come with any frame gen.  let me tell you, even this driver level frame gen is so much better than lossless scaling. I was recording benchmarks with my 12400f yesterday just so that I can have a comparison when I make the switch and something funny happened. I was playing helldivers and was wondering why I was getting 120 fps. I had remembered it being 60fps earlier. For a moment, I thought my CPU had become unthrottled or that a mew patch had droppeed with massive fps improvements. However, I suddenly realized that I had simply enabled smooth motion earlier. It's legit like native 120 fps and I didnt even realize it.  Of course, dont' expect it to make 60fps feel nice if you only have 30fps (Thankfully, that will never happen right now with this tier of cards as even Path tracing on cp2077 gives me like 55fps). However, who knows what magic nvidia will cook up next. Dynamic frame gen might be super interesting to try in spring as well.  I was this close to actually getting a 9070xt. However, after experiencing frame gen, both native and driver level, and now the new and improved dlss4.5, im so glad I trusted my gut and went Nvidia. It came at a massive price here in India as well (like $965) but when im dropping big money on a card, Id rather get the best feature set than save what is a negligble amount in the context of the  4-5 years I will be using the card.      I am only envious of the dudes with DDR5 memory because that adds a good 20% extra performance in a ton of games apparently. But I guess it's not good to be too greedy haha.",Positive
Intel,"Thank you so much, after your comment I did come to think that upgrading down the intel line was still an option (I obv didn't do it before because of the issue, and in my mind currently I'd just ruled out cpu upgrades because of the whole ddr5 prices, and forget about 14th gen Intel)  I am in the UK so prices are a little more, but I could definitely go for like a 14600 or such. Is there much difference between the like 4600kf and like 14700? I will be upgrading my cpu so I should probably go for a higher than 850w if I plan to upgrade my cpu given I just saw the 14600kf is a 125w",Positive
Intel,"The ""f"" indicator on the CPUs means that it's a version with the internal graphics chip disabled, which is generally not a problem if you're going to have a dedicated GPU, and shouldn't effect performance.  The ""k"" indicator means that the CPU has a higher max power draw, and that it's unlocked for overclocking. To overclock, you also need a Z-series motherboard. The higher max power draw does mean that even with your B-series board, the ""k"" CPU will be able to run slightly faster than the ""non-k"" variant of the same CPU, usually translating to around ~5% more performance in real world scenarios.   The 14700k(f) is 0-10% faster at most vs the 14600k(f) in gaming workloads, depending on the game, so the 14700 non-k would be even less of a difference vs the 14600k(f). There's generally no reason to go for a non-k variant over the k variant if it's not cheaper, and the same goes for the f CPUs. In the UK, it looks like the 14600 non-k is not available anymore from major retailers, and the 14600kf is about £20 cheaper than the 14600k, so probably worth saving the money with the f model in your case.  I usually use this as a quick reference for power supply requirements with CPU + GPU combinations: https://www.msi.com/blog/recommended-psu-table  You can see that for an Intel i7 CPU with the RTX 5080, they indicate that an 850w PSU should be fine if you aren't looking to overclock, so as long as your PSU is a good quality 850w, I wouldn't worry about the power draw.   On the other hand, the 5080 uses Nvidia's new 12pin HPWR connector, which requires an (included) adapter to be used with older PSUs. This connector has a pretty bad reputation for pulling power unevenly and *melting* if the connections are not secure, so most people advise to use power supplies with native 12pin HPWR connectors if possible, to avoid extra points of failure. If you're careful (or if your PSU has these connectors natively - it's usually indicated on the box as ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1), then it *shouldn't* be an issue, but these connectors are very finicky, so people are usually quite cautious about them.   The only other thing to note is that DDR4 does tend to effect the performance of these CPUs vs DDR5, which can range quite a bit depending on the game, with a few edge-cases actually running better on good quality DDR4 (games that prefer memory latency vs speed). This also effects 12th and 13th gen CPUs, so the performance differences between CPUs will still be the same in a relative sense, when both are using DDR4.",Neutral
Intel,"Thank you so, so sooo much <3 you are literally the best person ever, thank you  As for F, looking on the sites in the UK they generally seem to be around the same price as non F, so in that case I think I will grab a none F just in case of like, a gpu issue. Similar with K, the K are only marginally more expensive so I would definitely go with that over a none k.  As for 14700k vs 14600k, the 14700k is about £100 more than the 600, does that justify the price enough? The only other thing I can think of is for the 14600k the only version in stock for me is the F version (the others are all out of stock), so it's around £200 for 14600kf and like £320 for the 14700k.  Pins wise, yes I've done alot of very panicked research into the old vs new connectors, the melting and such. I was planning to upgrade my psu with the gpu (I currently have an 850w psu, I was going to get a corsair 850w at 3.1 for like £140) to get the at 3.1 ones with the native cable, and I was going to plug that thing in *very* firmly.

Intel,"I currently run 2 gpus (6800xt and 3060 12G). I use the AMD for most things and the 3060 for image and video generation in comfy ui. I also have 5 displays so both cards have displays hooked up. I tried Ubuntu a few months back and both x11 and Wayland had major issues with the dual gpu setup. I’m currently planning to put the comfy ui stuff on my server (strix halo) and remove the NVidia card to try Bazzite, but that’s still a bit of a ways off.  Power consumption isn’t great. It uses a lot of power sitting on the windows desktop (~400W) and about another 150W in Ubuntu on the desktop.   My recommendation would be if you’re going to use dual gpu for anything, stick to one brand and make sure your motherboard PCIE supports it correctly.",Neutral
Intel,"I feel you on the bus bandwidth issue. There are so many old cards like RAID controllers and 10GB+ networking gear that use PCI-E 8x. I'd rather have a second 16x or 8x slot than a bunch of m.2 slots.   I wouldnt even mind paying a bit more for extra IO, but it feels like the prosumer workstation tier died off years ago.

Edit: I just checked on Amazon and the Taichi is 300 bucks. Where did you get that $1500 price from?",Neutral
Intel,"One interesting thing to note is that even if you have enough PCIE 8/16x slots, if your CPU can’t handle that many lanes then the chipset will take the rest, and that will reduce speeds a good bit. Even if it doesn’t have to bifurcate the lanes. It’s ok for storage, but not ideal for GPUs. Like for example an Intel 12700k has 20 PCIe lanes that it can support directly, so after that, everything else is done on the chipset.",Neutral

Intel,"I've run dual gpu (albeit same brand) on multiple systems, and the result is mixed. In some games like E33 where parry timing is crucial, the moderate frame gains can be overshadowed by the perceptible latency. And god forbid you alt/tab, sometimes the frame gen would freeze on a certain frame and can only recover by turning scaling off and back on. For gaming it wasn't as game changing as I hope it would've been.   Though I should mention dual gpu for creative softwares is definitely a nice gain, I've set the windows graphics settings to use 1 gpu for premiere and 1 gpu for photoshop/lightroom, and it does speed up the workflow for both.",Neutral
Intel,"Do you currently have your monitors plugged into your main gpu? As far as I know, for the LS setup, you want to have displays connected to your secondary gpu at all times and set your games to run off the main.  This skips the need for main gpu having to transfer data to secondary and back.",Neutral
Intel,"Yup, pretty much my experience as well. I have a 3080 and a spare 2060.  I actually managed to get to a net positive outcome rendering the hard frames at 1080p and outputting through the 2060, but the amount of unnecessarily fiddling that requires is absolutely not worth the somewhat better framerate and painfully obvious worse latency.  My 2060 is back to collecting dust.  note: I had zero driver issues mixing different generations",Negative
Intel,"I hadn't heard of this, but also interesting that I have a proper X8/X8 board (Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master X3D). The other question is does Lossless Scaling work with the integrated GPU on the CPU like the Ryzen's typically have?",Positive
Intel,What an absolute stupid idea. If this is/was a thing there would be many many dual GPU systems reusing old GPUs around.  Surprise! There are none.,Negative
Intel,Totally agree.,Neutral
Intel,"From what I know it is not a problem coming from the motherboard. This CPU only has 24 PCIe lanes, it is far from enough to get 2 PCI ports at 16x and a nvme at 4x. The only way was to use the discontinued HEDT platform was offering that, with chipset like X299 adapted to i9-10980XE and its 48 lanes.  If you still need some additional PCIe lanes, you can use a Xeon W9 on W790 platform and you will have 112 PCIe lanes 5.0...",Neutral
Intel,"From testing different set ups, it is better to use different manufacturers unless you're using two gpus from the same generation (3090+3060, 6800+6600, etc). I've tested a few set up of just amd and Nvidia, and it only works if it's the same generation. You can't reliably run a 30 and 10 series. You can't run a 7000 with a rx580. ... Well you can, but you may have to mess around with older drivers and such.",Neutral
Intel,"Thank you for advise. I chose two different brands because most of the materials about dual gpu contain a combination of two different brands. Some even say that in this way you can use the advantages of both brands of video cards. For example, good performance from AMD and better codec from Nvidia or Intel.",Positive
Intel,"You dont have enough lanes to run 2 16x slots on consumer CPUs anyway. And with 16+8 you wouldnt have enough for a single NVME drive.  Most of the older ""slower"" expansion cards run fine on the chipset slots.",Neutral

I guess depreciation of older gen stuff is inevitable but I wish somebody offered a secondary 8x slot for a decent price.",Neutral

Intel,forza is one of the best optimized games ever made,Positive
Intel,"Not bad really. But then again, what do they consider playable?",Negative
Intel,"I mean that seems pretty fair. I'd say you can get a pretty good idea of what they consider ""minimum"" once they release the recommended system requirements. If it jumps all the way up to like a 3080 or something then you know their idea of ""minimum"" is barely playable.",Neutral
Intel,"Considering theyre requiring a 16xx gpu...the game isnt going to use rtx or lumen for the lighting by default. Those two things alone will kill frames. Also consider how many special effects they are expecting to go off at a time compared to something like a fps...smoke...thats about it. Alos, since its a racing game and the expectation is that people are going to go by everything at 150mph, they dont have to be tedious about texture sizes too much on anything other than cars.   Sure they can add settings (and probably will) for all that, but its a 16xx with fsr will run this well enough at 1080p. When you look at most games, the reason their minimum requirements are anything more than a 10xx or 16xx is because theyre using rtx and lumen by default. Also when you look at most games recommended setting, its usually 1440p with rtx and that does require quite a bit better card. But as far as straight raster at 1080p, a 1080ti is still (rip driver support) more than capable...especially since you can run fsr3 on it if you need a fps boost.  So tldr, its probably not that its optimized as much as they arent requiring rtx for lighting.",Negative

Intel,"I have both. When it comes to production work loads Nvidia is still king, however, if you are just concerned about gaming, go with AMD.",Neutral
Intel,"Between those two cards I would definitely go with the 9070xt especially if you only play CS2.    The main benefit of the 5070 is the quality of DLSS, but the 12gb are such a negative, that I would go with the 9070xt especially since CS2 runs good enough to not need any upscaling.    For very popular games like CS2 AMD drivers are not an issue, if you play some very niche games or use some CAD software then Nvidia might be the better choice.   Regardless of which one you choose you should buy as soon as possible as prices are increasing very quickly.",Positive
Intel,"You only play cs2? Respectfully, how tf is this even a question. You're never ever going to be take to take advantage of 400fps, or 430fps for the nvidia cars. N e v e r.   Get the cheaper one and be done with it.",Negative
Intel,"I do not understand the other comments, the 5070 is for your usecase likely better since you are only playing CS2, which neither needs more then 12GB VRAM or equal. The used value of the 5070 will likely also hold better then the 9070XT.  According your benchmark above you have 10% more FPS with the 5070 in the game you \*\*only play\*\*.",Neutral
Intel,"As a 5070 owner who recently upgraded to a 9070 XT, I’d highly recommend the 9070 XT. It has more VRAM, more overall performance (9070 XT is roughly equal to, though ever so slightly weaker than the 5070 Ti), and stronger native processing. The 5070 does have DLSS 4 and 4.5 (which are more widely available than FSR 4), but there’s not much else to sway me back.",Positive
Intel,AMD is the way to go if you’re at all interested in moving away from Windows towards Linux at any stage.,Neutral
Intel,"If you currently use, or plan to use, Linux then go with the 9070XT, if not then it pretty much comes down to a bunch of personal preference questions, I especially don't think that extra 4gb of vram is likely to do much for CS2, though I could be wrong as I haven't played since it replaced CS:GO.  That said, I have a personal hatred for Nvidia so I would suggest the 9070XT if you were to directly ask me :P",Neutral

Intel,Get a 1440p monitor,Neutral
Intel,You only play cs2?   What ever is cheaper dude. You will be maxing any monitor you own with both of those cards lol,Neutral
Intel,Keep in mind CS is also CPU-bound game and in 1080p you better have a good cpu to get high fps. Yes at 1080p the 5070 looks better. At 2k you will see the 9070xt performs better.,Positive
Intel,Cs2 1080p is not a good benchmark tool,Negative
Intel,"CS player here. TLDR:  * If you play on 4:3 aspect ratio, **it literally doesn't matter pick the cheaper card** * If you play on 16:9 or 16:10, then go for the 9070XT.   Explanation: (I'm assuming you have a good CPU and a 144hz monitor at least.)  In terms of raw raster power, which is mostly what is required in a badly optimized game like CS2, the 9070XT shines. You will notice a consistently ""smoother"" gameplay when gaming at higher resolutions since those 1% lows will hit hard and often ingame. In my experience the frequent drops in fps are mostly what affects performance and responsiveness, and why CS2 feels sluggish and inconsistent sometimes.       If however you're gaming at 4:3 the extra VRAM will not matter as you will consistently have more than 144 fps in any scenario, which matches your monitor's refresh rate (or 240 fps if you have a good cpu and a higher refresh monitor). So 5070 and 9070XT will have the same performance at 4:3 aspect ratio.  For what it's worth, I have the 5070 and my main game is CS2, no issues whatsoever at 4:3 1280x960. I also play other games at 1440p most at Max/High settings with no issues whatsoever. The 5070 is more than enough for your needs imo.",Neutral

Intel,"Intel is a new discrete card vendor, AMD's driver issue story is a decade old, even then it was overstated (I ran a HD7870 in 2022 still). Sure there were issues, but so had nvidia,like how vr was a stuttery mess for like a year recently. If it's not a typo and you mean 5070 not ti, it's not even up to debate I believe, AMD all the way. Solid cards, more vram, ray tracing has closed significantly, and linux support is night and day, I switched on nvidia recently which had some annoyances, since going 9070XT it's pretty much plug and play gaming. I don't think dlss is worth the hype, sure it can be better than TAA, but only because TAA is dogshit, and yeah nvidia is kind of a step ahead, but AMD does keep up. I picked a 4070 before this thinking dlss and rt and reflex is worth it, and felt disappointed by the end, sure they are alright, but not a big deal at all, or something I'd use in the first place given the choice.",Negative

For GTA, it was very similar so didn’t make a difference. I recommend checking YouTube benchmarks for the exact game you want to use the GPU for, don’t go with what a generalistic FPS comparison across games or with what other users tell you (because they might be playing very different games than you).

Intel,"Had/have both. The 5070 was fine, but as soon as I found a 9070XT at a great price in March of last year, I sold that Zotac 5070 Solid to a friend.  Hate to say it, but ultimately, I looked at the plugs, kept seeing issues with users having that cursed 12VHPWR fail. I also considered that even with a SFX power supply (my case is a T1 v2.5), there was still plenty of open connections to feed the extra 8+2 ports of the particular ASUS Prime OC 9070XT 16GB that I swapped to. Cable routing was more inconvenient.  Sold it to a friend that didn't care about all that. He got a card right after his older card died, and I was able to move onto the card I really was targeting (bought the 5070 in February).  If my purpose/wishes required a 5080 or even 5090, then I might have taken my chances long-term on relying on that 12VHPWR as a necessary evil/risk. Seeing as the 9070XT can compete with the 5070TI, but use the more proven power connector design, I would choose the more reliable option.",Neutral
Intel,Between these two cards the 9070xt for me. More VRAM and nvidia don't really compete with this card without dlss. I recently purchased a 5070ti because I wanted the dlss and 16gb for work but with your stated use case buy the 9070,Neutral

Intel,"Are you intending to play at max settings? Do you have an AM5 X3D CPU?   Because realistically, there shouldn't be any difference between the two graphics cards for CS2 otherwise, as you'll be entirely CPU limited.

If a 5070 is much cheaper you may wanna consider it depending on your budget, but you get a comparatively worse GPU with 12GB Vram.  That said if you can get a 5070ti for the same price or at least within 100-150 bucks of a 9070XT i'd consider that.  But between the 5070 and 9070XT, 9070XT all the way.",Neutral

YES the 5070 is also a bit cheap but at that point i would rather go with the 9070 XT.",Neutral
Intel,"If you genuinely only play CS2, it doesn’t matter which one you get. I doubt you will notice the extra FPS if you don’t run the counter. The extra 4GB would definitely be useful for down the road or other games and I have not had any driver issues with mine, but cannot guarantee your experience will be the same.   If you do choose Nvidia, I would suggest the ti for the extra VRAM. Understand as well that some people do still have driver issues. Due to the nature of the internet and fanboyism, I really couldn’t tell you if it is actors frequent or not. It may have to do with specific settings or configurations. But positives. The game you claim you play exclusively is optimized for Nvidia as you can see by the performance boost. Nvidia software and features are indeed more robust and proven. They are at least one generation ahead of AMD with RT, PT and upscaling tech. Don’t bother with frame generation in CS2 it adds input lag.   In short go with the one that fits your budget that you have enough confidence in. It will be in your system. Most people here will pick one brand or the other and try to say it is the only choice. That isn’t true. Both have pluses and minuses, you need to decide which one is more positive to you.",Neutral

That said, the better option is whichever you find cheaper, which is most likely going to be the 9070XT. At the same price, I'd go with the 9070 XT.  Both GPUs perform at a similar level, with variations depending on the game. In general, the 9070 XT performs slightly better, sitting in between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti. But there are specific cases in which the 9070 XT can fall below both, and others where it can rise above both.  The main actually notable advantage of the 9070 XT is the higher VRAM capacity.  The main actually notable advantage of the RTX 5070 is DLSS being better than FSR.

Intel,"You get more, than 360fps, so for cs it does not matter, for other games (if you decide to play them) the 9070xt is better, also for the future 12gb vram could become a problem sooner…",Neutral
Intel,"if you’re exclusively only playing CS, get whichever is cheaper. if you want a better all around card, get the 9070xt",Neutral
Intel,If you’re just playing cs2 then i suggest buying the cheapest gpu and the rest of the money goes to hacks just like everyone else,Negative
Intel,amd 16 GB cards. no brainer if you play on 1080p and competitive games it's the best value.,Positive
Intel,"The 9070XT is better than the 5070 To on average, often getting within a few fps of a 5080.  And compared to Nvidia cards right now, AMD can often be had much cheaper.",Positive
Intel,If u are a happy nvidia user rn and don’t want issues with drivers go with 5070 trust me… i also heard a lot of good things about amd gpus and went for rx 5700 in my previous pc and the drivers and especially amd adrenaline overlay were driving me insane… luckily i switched to rtx 5070 now and it works just as i remember nvidia things work - just perfect,Positive
Intel,I have the 9070xt and I love it. My last card was a gtx1080.   I'm all about value and for me the 9070xt was £150-£200 cheaper than the equivalent Nvidia card. If it had been the other way them I would have got the Nvidia card. Prices are all over the place ATM though so check around for deals. My card has gone from £550-£650 since I got it.,Positive
Intel,"Buy the 5070 for CS2 at 1080p if that's your focus, and accept the trade-offs if and when they become an issue later on.  Personally, I got the 9070xt because I play at 4k mostly and thus need the horsepower/vram, and the 5070ti was 20% more at the time.  Both will be good - the 9070xt is going to be better bang for the buck broadly, but certain applications/usages still favour nvidia.",Neutral
Intel,Always buy the biggest GPU you can afford.,Positive
Intel,At 1080p it won't make a difference. You could buy a 7900XTX and it would probably be your best bet.,Neutral
Intel,Buy one with 8Pin connectors so you can safely use your PC without burning your house down.,Neutral
Intel,"5070 if you do more than just gaming, for example video editing or blender. if you only do gaming and wont do any productivity in future then go with 9070xt",Neutral
Intel,Have a 9070 XT. Working great for me.,Positive
Intel,DLSS beats FSR and it’s more universally adopted,Neutral
Intel,"CS2 is a game that favours Nvidia cards, but in general for gaming - 9070XT is definitely better choice than 5070",Positive
Intel,Those frame rates are so absurdly high to me. I’m happily on a 60Hz crt 😃,Neutral
Intel,"9070 XT is at the level of a 5070 TI But you are saying the price is the same as the 5070?  9070 XT is a no brainer here, not even close.",Neutral
Intel,Go with AMD. Because depending on microslops future you might change to Linux and AMD works föawlessly most of the time on it other than nopevidia.,Neutral
Intel,Remember..vram exists and the more vram you got the better it is unless you only care about fps against its competitors.  The 9070xt has 16gb of vram vs 5070 having 12gb of vram.,Positive
Intel,I choose the one that doesn't design shitty power management or hate it's consumers. But you do you...,Negative
Intel,"Tbh, if you only play cs2 then the best option is to buy a mid range card like a 3060 and the rest of your money to upgrade the cpu, or even upgrade your monitor if you already have a good cpu",Neutral
Intel,"A cs player I know who plays esea main currently uses 9070xt, it's a good GPU for cs",Positive
Intel,"the 5070s are objectively worse in every way, don't even think about it and go buy the 9070XT.",Negative
Intel,You want a 9070 XT for only CS2 at 1080p? 😑,Neutral
Intel,"if you ever plan on going Linux, right now AMD GPU's are the choice. While NVIDIA GPU's are playable in linux, windows still wins at the FPS.",Positive
Intel,Either one seems super overkill for CS2 but do your thing,Negative
Intel,"It's 4 fps difference, just go Nvidia, you said had problems before with the other.",Neutral
Intel,get the 9070 so you could have the chance to switch to steam os,Neutral
Intel,you have to compare the 9070XT with the 5070 Ti  12GB VRam is bad in 2026,Negative
Intel,Can someone tell me why the 3090 with 24GB is better than a 5070 with 12GB?,Positive
Intel,"Unpopular opinion, especially from someone that usually chooses AMD, RTX 4070. It's still good. You can get it with an 8 pin power connector. 200 watts. There's some that are short. And there's some that have all of these. Great card to do a 5L SFF.",Positive
Intel,"9070xt over 5070, 5070ti over 9070xt but the 300-500€ higher Ti.. is it really worth it? If you want ray tracing and dlss then maybe if you have extra cash for it, but since you play CS2 those won't even matter. I have 9070xt and I have no regrets buying it.",Neutral
Intel,"9070xt.  Why care about dlss4.5 when the 9070xt can bruteforce the difference? And it has more vram, it's a no brainer at around the same price.  With that being said, buy a 2060 or something like that, chances are that it will be more than enough for cs2.   In my experience, the whole thing of bad AMD drivers must be either in the past, or the cope of a bunch of famboys, it just works as good as nvidia, in my case, it's even better, as the nvidia driver is a pos and generates some stutters in SteamVR for no reason",Neutral
Intel,9070xt unless you need cuda cores. More VRAM is going to be important going forward,Neutral
Intel,Well I was contemplating the same thing. But walmart has 5070 for $400 new. Honestly love the the upgrade to 5070.,Positive
Intel,Get amd and go linux.i got 5060 but i wish i got amd for that linux perfomance.i am running nobaru on my card it runes fine but some title i lose 10% perfomance,Neutral
Intel,"Hi guys, which page is that?",Neutral
Intel,If you are playing 1080p then GPU isn’t going to change thaaaat much,Neutral
Intel,You play CS on 1080p. The choice is basically irrelevant,Neutral
Intel,"I also was trapped between a 9070xt and a 5070. I could get them each for around 550€, but decided to go with the 5070. The reason was that the 9070xt takes a lot more power and I only have a 600w PSU. I would have needed to buy a new PSU for the 9070xt or needed to underclock it, which would has lost its purpose. I also plan to use it for different productive application where the 5070 Performance better.",Neutral
Intel,You dont need either for cs,Neutral
Intel,for cs2?   cringe,Neutral
Intel,I have the 9070XT and have over 200FPS on 1440p in CS,Neutral
Intel,9070xt. It’s not even debatable. If you found a 5070ti for $750-800 I’d go w that,Neutral
Intel,"To be honest, an RX 480 could run CS2 fine  But if you insist: here’s a very biased answer based solely on vibes and nvidia hate:  Get the 9070 XT",Neutral
Intel,I’ve got a 7800xt and I’m getting over 500 fps in Fortnite,Neutral
Intel,i have 9070xt. it’s a great card and runs lots of things 4k60+fps but i have so many driver issues with amd i think all th time about returning. i will keep trying to solve it though,Positive
Intel,All these cards will perform perfectly fine for competitive gaming as long as it’s not 4k max settings just get what suits ur budget and don’t buy into the war between amd and navidia as these people are just gonna back whatever card they own XD Im running a amd card and I’ve never had an issue or a bottleneck so Im sure anything in ur budget will do fine (considering ur talking about the cards in the attached image),Positive
Intel,AMD drivers are fine. If you only play cs2 then both of these cards are overkill.,Neutral
Intel,"If it's similar pricing/performance for your budget always get the Nvidia model for dlss, unless you need it for Linux.",Neutral
Intel,"both gpus are the ""same"" bc they are competing in the same range. So get what you want, i think theres not much difference in performance. Also, the 9070 and 9070XT both have 16gbvram and the 5070 12gbvram/5070TI 16gbvram.",Neutral
Intel,But cs2 is cpu heavy game,Neutral
Intel,"If you mostly play ""competitive"" games 100% get the 9070xt. Its a way better card for that, i would only recomend the 5070 if you're interested in the nvidia tech but those are completely irrelevant in games like csgo",Positive
Intel,nvidia shits on gamers heads.     and i choose based on that.,Neutral
Intel,"9070 XT has better performance at everything except ray tracing.  If you don't play tons of games that require that, I believe it is the better option.",Positive
Intel,Buy a 1080ti. Best GPU,Positive
Intel,"Even 9070 is better than 5070, XT is no brainer choice if you stuck in between these two.",Positive
Intel,4070 ti’,Neutral
Intel,I was making a similar choice between the 5060ti 16 GB and the 9060 XT 16 GB. I ended up going with the 5060 ti for CUDA compatibility for AI vision training and inference. If I only planned to use GPU for gaming I wouldve gone with the 9060 XT.,Neutral
Intel,9070xt >> 5070 in EVERYTHING   also  9070 non xt still >> 5070 in EVERYTHING,Neutral
Intel,Complete waste of money to play cs. You can buy something much cheaper.,Negative
Intel,I would aim for more vram.,Neutral
Intel,Depends entirely on your budget. If you exclusively play CS2 and can't imagine playing any highly demanding games then you can judt go with a cheaper option. But if you ever eventually wanna play Marvel Rivals or GTA 6 then go with the 9070XT,Neutral
Intel,If you only play CS2 then save yourself a small fortune and get an older card?,Neutral
Intel,I would personally choose the 9070xt since Ray Tracing and DLSS4.5 are not going to gain you much with the lower tier Nvidia GPU.  I'm saying this as an Nvidia user. Only get Nvidia if you can afford the 5070ti or better.,Neutral
Intel,"I was in the same boat as you this summer, except the 9070XT was about €100 more expensive than the 5070. I got the 5070 and don't regret it, it's a great card for the money (in today's market), but were they the same price, I'd have gotten the 9070XT.",Positive
Intel,9070 XT easily.,Neutral
Intel,Support the card that doesnt use that connector that people post daily pictures of being a melty mess.,Negative
Intel,Kinda wasting the card using it at 1080p but 9070XT no question,Neutral
Intel,Whichever has the best performance at your preferred price range.,Positive
Intel,"Truly,  are you really going to notice the difference?  Be honest, are you?",Neutral
Intel,5070 Ti > 9070 XT > 5070,Neutral
Intel,Glad to see my 6900xt still up on the list going strong,Positive
Intel,"Rx 9070xt, its not even a question. The 9070xt rivals with the 5070ti, whilst the direct comparison to the 5070 is the 9070 non xt. Its a no brainer, it doesnt even matter if you have dllss4 or fsr4, the raw power and extra vram makes up for any upscaling you could put in there",Positive
Intel,"Not sure why anyone would ever buy AMD. If you're ever going to play any other games, DLSS and other technologies are light years ahead of anything AMD put out. I'd only ever recommend their CPUs.",Negative
Intel,AMD - screw Nvidia and their AI bs,Neutral
Intel,I have a 9070XT and I’m happy with it.,Positive
Intel,9070xt gang +1,Neutral
Intel,9070XT for sure but you’re kinda wasting money if all you do is play CS on your computer. Could be a 2080 and you’d still be fine.,Neutral
Intel,9070 xt,Neutral
Intel,"toss a coin, pick the cheaper one or pick the one you like the looks of better. they are so close, that one in will perform better in some games, the other in others.",Neutral
Intel,"If all you play is CS2, get a 9060 or something... It's just wasted money buying a high price bracket card for this game, especially since the benchmarks are probably all on Ultra settings but nobody uses those for competitive.",Negative
Intel,"Good lord, there are a lot of DLSS haters in this thread, lmao.",Positive
Intel,"It's been asked a billion times, why not search?",Negative
Intel,"If you're truly only playing cs2, just get the 5070 since it's cheaper.  I just got the 9070 XT myself and it's an awesome card if you plan to play other games.",Positive
Intel,Never giving Nvidia my money ever again I don't care if I can't play GTA 6 on brain bleed mode it's not worth it. Besides they've made it very clear they don't give a fuck about home computer users.,Negative
Intel,I just recently bought the 9070xt after years of Nvidia only and was also thinking about the 5070 and i just can tell you that i don't regret it at all and i'm more then happy with my choice.,Positive
Intel,Get a 5070ti 5070 is poopy,Neutral
Intel,Buying a new GPU just to play a old FPS at min spec...,Neutral
Intel,5070 any day of the week.,Neutral
Intel,If you only play CS you dont you can get away with a way cheaper GPU,Neutral
Intel,Are you going linux or staying windows?,Neutral
Intel,Saving more money and go for the 5070 ti. Bought it a while ago. It's beast + DLSS 4.5 is a huge improvement.  Never know if in the future you are going to try a more demanding game or not. Just future proofing a little with current price of VGA,Positive
Intel,"Just buy whichever is cheaper, youre only playing CS2.",Neutral
Intel,I’ve always went Nvidia because my GPUs get recycled into my media server and until recently AMD just didn’t have the support that Nvidia does..  in the last year or so Intel and AMD GPUs seem to have much better support..  if I’m just gaming and on a budget I don’t think I could pass up the value of AMDs stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"If you're only playing CS 2 at 1080p you might as well save money and get a RX 9060XT or 5060Ti (16 GB models)  If you really want to play big games that are coming out in the next few years at high settings, like The Witcher 4 and GTA VI, I suggest the 9070XT.",Neutral
Intel,Honestly no matter which way you go your gonna have driver issues I have a 9070xt and have minimal issues if any with it. But you have to also think about the connector as well do you want the hassle of your cable nuking your card or not,Negative
Intel,9070xt with a set of standard power plugs because i refuse to have the fire hazard that is 12v2x6 in my house. can’t really bring myself to support nvidia until they address that issue in a meaningful way,Negative
Intel,"9070 xt is better, but depends on your budget really. Bith would be good",Positive
Intel,For CS2 at 1080p just get like a used 1080 it’ll do wonders,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia are where it's at. It's just fact if you look at the software and AI development. They're ahead of AMD and it doesn't matter what mental contortions AMD fans do. I don't give a shit about brands I give a shit about reality of features and that's why I say Nvidia is where it's at currently for GPUs just as AMD are the clear winners in the CPU space. 5070Ti is more comparable (and better) than a 9070xt though, 5070 it becomes more questionable.  Who cares for your use case though it's absolutely ridiculous.",Positive
Intel,Reddit AMDcirclejerk will always tell you AMD. It's a cult.,Negative
Intel,I’ll sell you my old shitty card that still clocks 180fps on CS2 if you want.  If you’re only playing CS2 you barely need to think about what GPU to buy lol.,Neutral
Intel,Get a 9070xt I got mines at micro center for 599 msrp,Neutral
Intel,Ich hab the 5070 and switched to the 9070xt. It was a nice improvent,Positive
Intel,"If it’s for CS2 only then neither, you should be looking raw horsepower which the 7900XTX has in abundance over both of those cards.",Neutral
Intel,"I bought a 5070 FE used from a good friend who used it one week and decided he wanted something more powerful. He ended up with one of those Doom 5080s and sold me the 5070 below msrp and ebay prices for used. I love it, it is defiantly the nicest card I've had the chance to own.",Positive
Intel,Whatever you get cheaper and/or faster (from a good source),Positive
Intel,Id always default to Nvidia. Rock solid.,Neutral
Intel,"If performance in a single game is so important, you should probably look up performance on the latest drivers as things change over time and reviews aren't updated to reflect this.  This is exactly the reason why it's a bad idea to based comparisons on a single game.  The 9070 XT has higher overall performance as reviews show, which means it's entirely possible a driver or game update pushes it's performance above the 5070.  Plus I don't know a single person that ended up only playing a single game on their GPU over it's life.",Negative
Intel,9070 plain. XT gives you 10% more performance for 20% more money and 30% more power draw. Bad deal for a marginal improvement.,Negative
Intel,Damn I have finally reached the point where my card isn’t on these charts. Guess it’s time to make a new build!,Negative
Intel,"It seems like both those cards are overkill for what you're doing, why not a 9060XT 16GB or the equivalent nvidia?",Negative
Intel,"If you're truly only going to play cs2, the 9070xt is only 5% faster at 1440p according to hardware unboxed's testing with a 9800x3d. With any other CPU, they'll perform identically.   The 9070 XT is the better card, but not for cs2. I don't get why everyone's missing that point in the comments",Neutral
Intel,"For  same price 9070xt, it's a no brainer, more rasterization power and more VRAM, it competes with the 5070ti. CS2 probably needs some sort of update, those numbers don't add up. Drivers in AMD are pretty stable just make sure to use DDU to uninstall any nvidia driver in safe mode or flat out format your hard drive (that's what i did).",Neutral
Intel,"I used to play CS2 before I got BF6... It's great for it, on a 300hz 1440p screen getting about 450fps. Never had a driver issue at all on CS2, it will be more than fine.",Positive
Intel,"just get whatever one you have the best deal on, everyone crashing out over dlss vs fsr but that doesn't even matter when you have 400fps at native res",Neutral
Intel,"I am a 5070 user and I really enjoy perks like first access to the new upscaling models -- DLSS 4.5 -- and (the previously exclusive to NVIDIA GPUs) in-home game streaming with Moonlight. That said, I also really find myself wishing that I had 4 more GB of VRAM. You need to be careful not to saturate it because it will bork up your framerate and you will need to reset your game to fix it.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 4070 and it works great for cs2 at 1440p 240hz. the 5070 is a little better, so it's very good. if you have like a 360hz+ monitor than I'd say 9070xt, it definitely has much more raw performance than the 5070, and that's exactly what you want for a competitive shooter. If you want to save some money, or don't need that kind of power, 5070 is just fine",Positive
Intel,"If you're looking just to have a nice card, Nvidia has been stocking the the 5070 founders on their site for $550. The 9070xt is $200 more, so it's not a comparison. the 5070ti though? I'd probably do the 9070xt because the games you play can nearly run on integrated graphics.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m going to say this, AMD drivers have been a little rough for the past 6 months. 25.10.1, 25.11.1, 25.12.1 and the yesterday unveiled 26.1.1 all have issues in some games on windows. I’m talking driver timeouts, lower utilization, wrong clock speeds. It’s been rough, but I won’t fully blame AMD. The fact of the matter is I get 50-60 fps more in a lot of titles on Linux and zero crashes. My SO has a 5070 and on most of the games we play she makes 50~ fps less than me (sometimes even more). But on windows that can drop to 30 or even 20. Regardless the 9070xt is more powerful. Make sure to reinstall windows fresh, and update to 26.1.1. So far on this new driver I’ve had zero crashes on windows.",Negative

Intel,"I bought the 9070xt a month ago. Got a good price ($560). Sold my 3070 for $250 so net cost was pretty low. Benchmarks are full 2x improvement pretty much. I have no complaints although make sure you safe mode ddu. First time I didn’t do safe mode and stuff was crashing constantly.   I was researching constantly and it had the best ROI at the time.   If you want to do any AI at any point, or a bunch of encoding, maybe go Nvidia. Latter maybe a point of argument but it always outperforms AMD for me",Positive
Intel,9070xt i think the drivers been good lately,Positive

Intel,I would not buy a 12GB Gpu in 2026.     So its either 5070 Ti or 9070 XT,Neutral
Intel,I would go with the 9070 non XT if it saves you more money since the XT isnt worth it,Neutral
Intel,"If all you're playing is CS2 at 1080p, either card is probably overkill.  You'd be fine with a 9060 XT (even 8GB), and it would be a whole lot cheaper.  Or if you want to stick to Nvidia, a 5060 or 5060 Ti.  Unless you're playing at elite levels of competition, the difference between 300fps and 400fps is pretty academic.",Neutral
Intel,i vote 16GB vram. but seems like you are updating often so maybe don’t  have to worry about longevity.  but counterpoint if you want good drivers i think nvidia is better supporter of drivers for their cards.,Neutral

Intel,dont forget about the nvidia rtx 4090 64gb titan card ai slop edition,Negative
Intel,If it's 5070 ti then 100% worth it. 5070 over 9070xt is only worth it if you need ray tracing or you work with 3D software like blender or any video editing software...even obs. Nvidia is much better in performance for those.,Positive
Intel,Get the GPU that is more optimized for your game.,Neutral
Intel,If you only ever plan on playing counter strike then yes 5070 is what you want if however you thinking about playing any other game the 9070 / 9070xt is worth it depending on pricethe 9070 is slightly faster the 9070xt much more so its just not at counter strike.,Positive

Intel,Either get 5070ti or 9070xt just look at games you wanna play and compare fos,Neutral
Intel,"What PSU are you using?  The 9070xt draws 400w at peak so if you are getting a 12hpwr connector card, make sure to get the voltage protector board by TG or Aqua.   My research took me from the 5070 to the XT to the 5070ti.  1. Ram on the first jump 2. Power on the second jump. The AMD does draw 50 to 60% more, putting the connector into a higher risk category for burn out. I was also limited by the PSU and didn't want to undervolt.  If you get a 12hpvwr over voltage protection board, and you have the PSU bandwidth. The 9070xt is an easy choice. As others have said, Linux.....and SteamOS.  Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,"I was deciding between these two, then got a 5070Ti for almost the same price on some luck, and haven't regretted anything. I thought I was gonna switch to a ""red"" GPU, but this is my 3rd Nvidia GPU and haven't been let down even once yet (knock on wood)",Negative
Intel,"Get whatever is cheaper, which probably would be 9070. What problems are you expecting playing only cs2? Besides, AMD driver issues is now thing of the past - thing of the present is both AMD and NVidia driver issues. And AMD and Intel CPU microcode issues. And SSDs randomly dying because of shitty OS update.  Everything's shit, and also expensive. So, pick whatever is cheaper, you'd have some issues either way. Or not. But vendors do not matter much.",Negative
Intel,"CS2's optimization isn't particularly friendly to AMD graphics cards. I recommend sticking with NVIDIA cards instead.  But, both of these cards offer more than enough performance. It ultimately comes down to whether you have productivity needs. If you require model training and CUDA acceleration, then the 5070 is undoubtedly the better choice.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, if the 5070 plays the games you like better then get a 5070  but if it's pretty close get the 9070xt as it will be overall better in most games",Positive
Intel,Who told you that 9070XT would have more driver issues? I have come across far more from my customers using nvidia cards now with severe issues,Negative

It has CUDA technology that makes it a lot easier to dabble in AI generation, if you wanna do that.  9070 XT has more Vram though, and will last longer when you consider running the newest games. Although it's the weaker option for ray tracing.  I have the 9070xt and I'm very happy with the choice,  but setting up Stable Diffusion was a bit of a hassle for me.  So there's pros and cons on both sides.  If one is significantly cheaper, I would go with that. They're both great options.",Positive
Intel,For cs2 no other gpu than 5090.,Neutral
Intel,"Dude you play cs2 on 1080p. like seriously , any potato gpu will get you over 200 fps. are you a pro?  get the cheapest GPU.    also, nvidia drivers have been a lot worse than AMD for years now.",Negative
Intel,"i also had ro decide betwen thise 2, went for the 5070because i got doom tda for free with it, others wise i would have gone for the 9070xt, 16gb is pretty nice",Positive
Intel,"I know this wasn't your question, but have you thought of going with the 9060xt? It offers 16gb vram (there is also the 8gb version but I wouldn't get it for an upgrade) and if you're only playing cs you'll get good performance anyway  Edit: I'm only mentioning it as an option because it's considerably cheaper and I believe it would be enough for your use case. If you have the budget and want to go for one of these anyway for the higher performance, I'd go with the 9070xt",Positive
Intel,"screw Nvidia get the 9070xt. I've had mine since launch day (3090ti owner before that) and have had almost no issues beyond the first few weeks when games/drivers were stabilizing to the new hardware. Cost to performance ratio is crazy good, I just wish there was a higher vram option since I do a lot of vrchat.",Positive
Intel,For same price 9070 XT is EASY choice. Just reinstall Windows when you upgrade (even if you pick 5070 for some reason) so you completely delete old drivers.,Positive
Intel,Multi-player games either one will do. If you play AAA games. Having nvidia MFG can help make games feel smooth with higher frame rates. But 9070xt is no slouch. You be happy with either one.,Positive
Intel,Normally I’d recommend the 9070 xt but for your use case the 5070 is the better buy. Just get the cheapest option of the 2.   Also maybe check the performance of a 5060 ti/ 9060 xt and save yourself some money.,Positive
Intel,For real? the 9070 XT is as of now equal or faster than the 5070 ti...,Neutral
Intel,"Stop using CS2 or COD as a benchmark for these cards, they are both heavily biased towards one brand of card.",Negative
Intel,9070xt unless you absolutely need CUDA for a specific purpose,Neutral
Intel,"When did native resolution suddenly become an OK sacrifice? DLSS is better than FSR but I'd rather just play at the native resolution because it looks heaps better.  DLSS should not be a selling point unless you're buying a mid-low tier card.  ""I can play Monster Hunter at 456 FPS with reduced visuals on my 240Hz monitor. DLSS is awesome""   Give your heads a shake.",Neutral

Intel,"The 5070 is / will be handicapped by it's lack of VRAM.   The advantages of the 5070 are CUDA (only if you need it) and DLSS.   FSR is pretty good these days, and Nvidia drivers for 50 series are still janky.   I think the AMD is likely a more sensible choice.    I went with a 5080 because I use CUDA in productivity apps.",Neutral
Intel,9070xt.   Much cheaper if you factor in NOT burning your house down.,Neutral
Intel,"Right?? Everyone arguing that one card is ‘better’ than the other but we are genuinely talking about 400fps vs 430fps. Wtf is even the point of the whole discussion, this dude probably has a 165Hz monitor or something along the lines.",Negative
Intel,I have a friend who exclusively plays CS on a 1080p 144hz monitor and he just made a completely new build with a 4070 but refuses to get a new monitor lol. So why the fuck spend the money you idiot?!,Negative
Intel,Because 300 FPS isn't enough apparently,Neutral

Intel,"I had the same problems, I disabled auto updating with the help of youtube video and now I did not across any  problems in 7 months.",Neutral
Intel,"I think the driver issue comes from people switching from nvidia to AMD. Nvidia drivers behave like malware when you try to uninstall it, leaving  behind files that conflict with hardware from the competition. a lot of people don't know about this, so they don't use DDU (or use it wrong) or flat out nuke the OS.",Negative
Intel,"Oh god, during the Vega days and then the 5000 series days. I ended up returning my launch 5700xt because the drivers were so broken it was just crash after crash after black screen.   I haven't went back to AMD GPUs since but I assume they have gotten miles better.",Negative
Intel,"Just bought a 9070xt and handed down my 3090. I was very worried about AMD driver issues, but it's been solid for me. I'm actually impressed by the metrics and monitoring in Adrenaline.  With Nvidia, I was stuck on a very old driver because newer drivers weren't stable for a couple of my primary games. I went AMD instead of 5070TI because it was a $150 USD price difference.",Positive
Intel,"Same here, and it’s most been great apart from one big ***   Indiana Jones Hidden Circle had several game breaking bugs annoying late in the game.   Other than this, which is very frustrating as I was 30 hours into the game and literally cannot progress past the crash, it is great",Positive
Intel,Also went AMD this time. Drivers have not been an issue and the software auto detected which driver i needed and installed it right away. I had to do nothing.,Negative
Intel,Drivers are still sour with older cards but the last few years it's been pretty solid for their newer ones.,Positive
Intel,"I have also switched to amd after using nvidia since 2013, i did had windows update corrupt/unninstall my video drivers twice, but again, i just did DDU and installed the card, maybe it was exclusively windows fault",Neutral
Intel,"I upgraded my 980ti to a 7900xtx in 2023. I've had 1 issue since then. It was an issue with DirectX12 in WoW and PuBG. The weird part was Dx12 worked in retail wow but was having issues in classic wow, so I think it was more a Blizzard implementation issue than an AMD issue. As for PuBG, idk. Other than that, my experience with AMD has been good. (I had an HD 6950 and a 9800 Pro back in the day, too, and I didn't really have issues either).",Neutral
Intel,"i dont know if this i just me but so far ive only had shit experiences with AMD, tons of driver crashes, games dont support fsr (not amds fault but still a gripe)",Negative
Intel,also a 9070xt owner. had a few weird stability issues in the beginning but updating fixed them all and irs been smooth sailing after the first month or so. bought it pretty much at launch so some bumps are to be expected. my model is also pretty quiet even on load which is nice.,Positive
Intel,"Funny I had the exact opposite experience coming from 5 years of a 3070 undervolted  First driver I installed in December crashed all the time , I had to find a stable one , but since then, it has been as it was on Nvidia with Shadow Play / Recording while gaming which was relatively stable but sometimes for some reason just didnt resume working after Hibernation.",Negative
Intel,"In my recent experience, it is Nvidia drivers that are terrible. Over the last 4 years, I've never had any driver issues with my 5700xt or 7800xt, but my daughter has had driver issues with both her 2070 and 4070.  She still can't get open GL to work on the 4070.  Everytime I find a way to fix it, it seems to break itself the next day.",Negative
Intel,Go look through the amd sub it’s not nvidia shills trashing amd drivers.  There are so many posts about driver timeouts and black screens still.  The new thing is to buy an open box 9070xt and realizing why it was an open box.,Negative
Intel,He clearly says that he only plays CS2. And the chart clearly shows that the 5070 is better than the 9070XT in that particular game,Positive
Intel,70% of gamers upscale.  Why the fuck is everyone in this subreddit pretending  raw raster is only thing that matters,Negative
Intel,"If anything, Nvidia drivers have been ***A LOT*** worse than AMD the last year or so",Negative

Intel,The difference in VRAM is irrelevant on CS2.,Neutral
Intel,Why if this person plays one specific game? I just cannot see a reason for them to get the worse performing card because in this particular title it does seem like the 5070 out performs the 9070xt.,Negative
Intel,people still going on about vram even thou it has been tested that does nothing to performance as long as u have enough (hint: it has enough),Negative

Intel,"Also u get dlss, framegen which is just better in nvidia and better performance in like video editing apps etc",Positive
Intel,Wait hold up..... I only read the title and didn't know it was for cs2 specifically..... bro its overkill if you're buying a 9070xt or 5070 for cs2 if thats only the one game you play. You can get an rx580 that will do the job or at most a 6600xt since you wont be needing 4k for cs2. 1080p with maximum fps with those cards and anything higher is just a waste of that gpus potential and money unless you play other games at maximum graphics. Plus we need to know what monitor you use too. Do you have a 1080p monitor? A HD 2k monitor? Or a 4k monitor?,Negative
Intel,Not saying to get this card just saying that anything above it I’m sure u won’t bottleneck unless ur playing some 4k game at max graphics,Neutral
Intel,People are telling me gpu doesnt matter but i have a 1050ti. Most people in this thread dont know what they are talking about. 1050ti is bottlnecking it so bad.,Negative

Intel,"I think this bench is a little bit dubious there shouldn't be such a massive difference between cards in CS2, it's usually extremely CPU bottlenecked even at 1080p. With a 7800XT and 9800X3D i get way more than 300 avg. 750ish on the benchmark map, \~450-550 avg in game depending on the map. ""TPU Custom scene"" i really wonder what that is.",Negative
Intel,I was back when the 9070xt was released and cs2 has abysmal performance. They later patched it so now it's good.,Positive
Intel,What? The 9070 XT will easily beat a 5070 in RT outside of Path Tracing (if you're able to fit it into the 5070s VRAM limits). The 9070 XT is straight up better outside of productivity and some Nvidia QOL features.,Positive

Intel,And then you stuck at driver checking when installing proxmox on your repurpose gaming PC since GT710 is too damn old even for proxmox..,Negative
Intel,"And Nvidia drivers are ass now, but nobody ever talks about that.",Negative
Intel,"just to give perspective. I had a 390 from 2016 to 2023. I've never had any issues except knowing if the driver sided AA is working or not (which was a special usecase that didn't matter much). Now I have a 6800xt. 0 issues.  Driver issues are vastly exaggerated online and the myth of amd having bad drivers is almost 15 years old now. They were bad but as you said, ages ago. Today nvidia has way more issues with their ai vibe coding (which amd also will have). Stick to the rule as always: Don't update on release day, wait a month at least unless you really have to.",Neutral
Intel,"More importantly, initial drivers for the 5000 series were complete shit. Took months before nvidia improved that.",Negative
Intel,"The peak ""AMD drivers bad"" era was genuinely pushing a decade ago at this point. There were some decently widespread issues with year 1 RDNA2 iirc, I had a day 1 6900XT and had pretty much zero issue personally but I know that's anecdotal. Outside that I feel like AMD driver issues really started tapering off after Polaris launch. I never had any driver issues I couldn't fix with a google search and like 15 minutes effort my entire time with an RX480 8GB and even having to do that was extremely rare.  I'll actually say my HD6950 was annoying to troubleshoot and was a headache at times but also that's a GPU from 2010/2011 and iirc literally part of the first generation of AMD GPUs after the ATI branding got killed. And the entire reason I swapped to it was I also had driver issues with my Fermi architecture Nvidia GPUs so I figured I'd try a Radeon card. Both brands I was having issues with in that era tbh.",Negative
Intel,The drivers were ass before most of the people in this forum were out of diapers and at that time Omega drivers were the preferred option.,Negative
Intel,Yup windows fucks shit up.,Negative
Intel,Weren't there rumours that the reason some people had really bad issues compared to others was because there were some bad batches of the cards themselves? (It was a big proportion of the launch cards if I remember correctly). Can't make claims on the validity but if it was that many it's possible that and would never admit it because they'd have to replace so many,Negative
Intel,Weird. I bought a 5700XT at launch and never had those issues. Kept it running all the way until last month when I upgraded to a 9070XT.,Negative
Intel,"I dunno about that, searched timeout on the AMD reddit and it returned 1 result in the last 9 years.  I'm sure there are more but you are absolutely misrepresenting the frequency.  The AMD sub actually allows users to post their issues.  On the Nvidia sub, you aren't allowed to outside the one megathread they have for it and even then the mods aggressively delete anything not positive of Nvidia there.    Your open box example is just you trying to craft a story to fit your narrative.  If open box = bad drivers (when it could be dozens of other things), you fail to realize there are in general more open box Nvidia products for sale than AMD (simply through virtual of them selling more cards).  By your nonsense logic, Nvidia's drivers much be bad.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, because no one is gonna post that their drivers are working fine and without issues. You're always gonna see complaint posts because it's why people will post there. For advice.  The Nvidia sub doesn't have it because there's a master list of all issues already available and the fixes for them. AMD doesn't have such a master list on their sub. Also, a lot of issues are labelled as driver faults when they're actually ram instability and CPU issues instead. People don't typically test things themselves.",Negative
Intel,"go to the nvidia sub and they have their own set of problems, go to the ferrari sub and they have problems, go to the banana's sub and they report issues with banana's     all those subs have ppl posting problems.. nobody goes there to say they have 0 problems. you only read complaints on forums.",Negative
Intel,Do you mean amdhelp? It’s a subreddit for AMD Cards and CPUs having issues. Yes people are having issues on there so they post there. I had a problem with a new gigabyte 5070 where it kept black screening and had no where to go. Remember 572.83? Pepperidge farm remembers. I see melting connector post here everyday that must explain all the returned nvidia cards. See how cherry picking works?,Negative
Intel,"If he only plays CS2, he doesn't need either unless he's pro (and even then it's still questionable).  The game doesn't need anywhere near this level of power.  Mind you, most people will not play one single game for the entire period they expect to keep a GPU.   This is why basing the decision solely on CS2 performance is silly.",Negative
Intel,"The day he steps outside his bubble, he will appreciate going with the card that is a tier above. If the 2 are similar performance, but one plays WAY faster in every other game.... why not buy the tier up, if for nothing more than the longevity and resale down the road?",Positive
Intel,because fsr4 is good enough and frame gen sucks even tho jensen will give you 20x frame gen next year and tell you it looks amazing,Positive
Intel,"First, your 70% figure is entirely made-up.  70% of gamers don't even have cards that can accelerate AI upscaling.  Second, the 9700 XT has higher base performance.  The need to upscale is less.  Third, the 9700 XT has more memory, giving the card more longevity.",Neutral
Intel,"To be completely honest I have 9070xt since week after release.   I've had a 1 situation when Windows decided to update Radeon drivers to a Radeon PRO drivers, I was shocked when I saw blue accents in adrenalin instead of red ones.",Neutral
Intel,"I could be misinformed but I think Nvidia did clean their act up in the final quarter of 2025 basically. But absolutely I think some people just glossed over that Nvidia had genuinely terrible drivers fairly consistently for the bulk of 2025. With some of the highlights being the early Blackwell drivers being unstable so the pro strat was using pre-launch drivers from iirc December 2024 that didn't support multi frame gen and maybe DLSS4 in general.  That one specific driver that would set custom fan curves to 0RPM at all temps and cooked multiple GPUs to the point of needing to be RMA'd. Which while it did get hotfixed like a full day later, that was A. still long enough we saw multiple reports of broken cards and B. they weirdly didn't force the update or heavily promote on social media or anywhere to tell people to do the update. So if you were out of loop which some people were, we still saw a few more cooked GPUs drip feed in days after it was fixed.  And the Doom the Dark Ages ""Game Ready Drivers"" that literally in the patch notes first block of text ""Documented crashes when playing Doom the Dark Ages"". The game ready drivers literally weren't game ready.  And just in general stretches of weeks to months of bad drivers consecutively that led to people basically constantly having to check in on which specific driver versions were ""safe"" to update to and when to stay on version for long periods of time before updating. It was at least half of 2025 if not three quarters of it that Nvidia had questionable drivers. Meanwhile AMD's drivers were probably the most stable they'd been in a while for the bulk of 2025, including the launch day drivers for RDNA4 were weirdly just good. They did have the advantage of the delayed RDNA4 launch but day 1 9070 and 9070XT drivers seemed to just kinda work.",Negative
Intel,Had the same problem.   to fix the constant driver time-outs I had to disable the igpu.,Negative
Intel,They’re also all above 300 fps and he’s only playing 1080p. Will that much fps make any real difference considering the monitors at theat resolution? OP can save a good amount of money if they just get a cheaper card like the 7800 XT.,Neutral
Intel,It's enough for now but games have increased vram demands with every year so enough for now isn't that great when you could have plenty for the future and have a longer lasting card. 12 GB will probably last you the next 4 years with only fringe cases using more but I usually like my gpu to last 8. Four years in my main pc and four in my secondary pc.,Neutral
Intel,"Screams ""i don't do my research"".",Negative
Intel,"If you don't mind tinkering with things, you can usually enable it even if not officially supported. I just started using optiscaler but I recently got a 9060xt. With a 9070 you're probably right that it's not really needed, especially where it's not already supported",Neutral
Intel,Odd take.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, what does a 5070 have over a 9070 xt in CS2 then?",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, unless they’re planning on only playing CS2 on their PC and nothing else for the rest of their lives, the 9070xt would probably be a better option overall. For me, the better graphics on a lot of things and stronger performance are more important than an extra 36 fps on a card that already gets almost 400 fps.  Also, I saw that a driver update in July allowed the 9070 XT to beat the 5070 in 1440p, but I don’t know when these specific benchmarks were taken, since I’m seeing several different ones. Does anyone know where this benchmark chart is from?",Neutral
Intel,Im not buying a 9070xt or 5070ti because 16gb is not enough for me. I have a 6800xt a d I get texture cycling in some games.,Negative
Intel,"Its enough for now but will you still be able to say that in 4 years or 8 years? It will probably do fine for 4 in all but the most demanding games but I like my cards to last 8 years. Four in main pc and then another 4 in secondary pc, and then often given away to family.",Neutral
Intel,Untrue. It’s affected anything with that connector starting with the 4000 series.  Someone just posted a higher end 9070 XT (I think it was a Sapphire Nitro+) that burned up.  But most 9070 XT use either 2 or 3 PCI-E 8-pin,Negative
Intel,"Wtf is this question then? You can go with 300€ cards and get above 300fps at all times.  If you want to be free in the future, you're forced to go AMD anyway, since NV refuses to patch to Linux.",Negative
Intel,"Note how even the lowest card on that graph is higher fps than your monitor? Get the cheapest one that does your max refresh.    Of course that graph is also 1080p, so if youve got a different resolution you should use that as your basis. But most modern cards will crush CS2. Its not a very hardware intensive game.",Neutral
Intel,"Fair, but I'm not sure that a 9060XT wouldn't last for several years. Personally I'm hoping gpu prices come down a bit in the near future so I can grab a 9060XT myself. I'm also staying on AM4. In either case, GLHF!",Neutral

Intel,"yeah my job/business is well, gaming PCs   though I'm liquidating all of the new in box stuff and quitting it all",Positive
Intel,"There are, things like DDU, but there are always traces left in registries and maybe even some game files.   It's good when you're upgrading to the same brand of GPU, but when changing brand I always recommend fresh Windows.",Neutral
Intel,"A valid point, but I'm thinking of the bigger picture.  I'd be surprised if OP didn't decide to play anything else in the next few years.",Neutral
Intel,"you are mostly right. any frame above your max refresh rate is a waste of electricity.   however, if you are getting 200 fps on a 100hz monitor, thats not exactly a waste. monitor displays the most recently produced frame at any given moment. that means the higher your fps, more responsive the game feels.   can most of the people can tell the difference? probably not. I cant tell myself. Still i lock my fps double the amount of refresh rate. fps dips during gaming. its nice to have some headroom even if you cant tell. at least for competetive fps games.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause back in the day when we played TFC/CS we barely made 30 fps    Even for today standards , a hair above your monitor refresh rate is enough    buying a 5070/9070 for 1080p cs is straight up retarded",Negative
Intel,"There is no reason to buy a 9070 over a 5070 given the minuscule performance difference but big software features quality difference, so it remains the same.  9070XT is a complete performance tier above. But also a whole price tier above.  It’s all about budget.  I personally think that unfortunately for AMD if loking for a 9070XT might as well get a 5070ti If looking for a 9070 better get a 5070",Neutral

Intel,Yup. That's the only issue with AMD cards. You have to tinker with windows settings to turn off auto updates or else it fucks your drivers. That's more of a Windows issue than AMD.,Negative
Intel,"Screams ""I only listen to redditors"".  I swear you could inverse reddit advice for PC building and come out on top 99% of the time.",Neutral
Intel,"I agree, but sometimes you read reviews and see benchmarks of a GPU, think it will meet your usecase and then it doesn't. Then you got that annoying niggle in the back of your mind, that you messed up, and now are you going to live with it, or take a small hit and get what you actually should have.  To give one example, would be people claiming card can play 1440P/4K, when they can probably play those res at Mid setting to an acceptable FPS, or only on older games. And example would be all the people claiming a B580/9060XT 16GB does well at 1440P, when they honestly don't, unless you are playing some older games/less intensives games (Or want to play 1440p with a mix of low-high setting and get a barely stable 60 FPS on more intensives games with upscaler).  or the people who loved to claim a 4070TI was a 4K card. New builder may also get confused with benchmarkers using a 7800X3D/9800X3D to test a budget and mid tier card, not understanding the CPU is helping it's performance and a mid tier CPU will produce different results. Games also get patches which cause worse performance. You could end up watching an old benchmark, from maybe even 3-9 months ago, and get a false idea of what the GPU can do in the game you plan to mostly play. E.G: Tekken 8 released and the min GPU to play FSR 2 Ultra performance low/mid was a 1050TI, after a few patches (\~9 months) it was a 1660TI, nowadays 18+ months on, it can barely run on a 2060S at min setting. This was across the board, a 4070 was producing worse results at older settings and you had to crank down the res and/or setting. ETC ETC. There's a lot of reason why people end up slightly upgrading after they bought, even if they have done the research.  A lot of people on this sub, also don't help, people have mad copium and love to inflate the performance of their GPUs. It still isn't uncommong to hear, Oh yeah my 3600/3060 crushes \*insert new modern intensive game\* (e.g: MHW), when they really do not. Not a diss to those will older hardware, but stuff like that circulating only helps to confuse people.",Negative

Intel,"It seems like that’s the case.  “ I only play CS2.” doesn’t really leave much room for interpretation.  Like I would certainly get the 9070 XT over the 5070 in almost every situation but if this is the specific scenario, yeah, I would get the 5070.",Neutral

Intel,5070 ti is like $300 more in my region compared to a 9070xt. It's a no brainer for me to go with the 9070xt in that sense.,Neutral

Intel,"The 9070 and 5070 are essentially the same in performance tho, and why I prefer the AMD card is not having to deal with the 12vHpwr and having 4 gb more vram, also mutch better Linux support.   It's a hard pick tbh, but I value this more than the Cuda cores, ai performance and other Nvidia things, of which I only can miss dlss, since having both main competitor's software available is a win, but I trade core stuff. It's a tough choice",Positive

Intel,">annoying niggle in the back of your mind  Sure, the 9070XT is the better card but dropping $700+ for 10% more performance is just dumb no matter how you look at it. It’s just spending for the sake of spending.",Negative
Intel,"Really? Where I live, they’re roughly the same price (or they were, until the 9070xt microcenter deal expired). Honestly, I’d love to know why the 5070 beat the 9070 XT here, because the 9070 XT averages around 10% more powerful than the 5070 in the benchmarks I’m seeing, (though it does shift up and down a lot, so I’m truly curious why).",Neutral
Intel,"I guess a better way of putting it is that I don’t think OP should be basing such an expensive decision on the single game they’re currently playing, especially when the 9070 XT outperforms the 5070 in so many other non-shooter games. Ultimately, it’s up to them, but I would recommend that they consider whether or not they’ll ever want to play any other games.",Neutral
Intel,"Kinda, tho to be pedantic, if you lock the framerate to 165, one will use a smidge less power.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean I’m pretty pro-AMD but if you can get the Nvidia equivalent and have better software support and features and hardware for not much more it’s a no brainer. I had the choice of 9060XT, 5070, and RX 9070 and I got the 5070 cause I don’t wanna question if a game will support certain features. I don’t wanna question if I need to use optiscaler for upscaling, or question if they’ll treat my card like the $1000 7900XTX and make it obsolete after a year or two. All those things I have to question buying into AMD, but not Nvidia and for most enthusiasts it’s worth the premium.   Hell, I had people saying to buy a 9060XT with worse RT, Software, less raster by like 35% over a 5070 for nothing but 4GB VRAM extra. That’s a lot of compromise IMHO",Positive

Intel,"Longer software support as well, Nvidia won’t drop support after 2 generations given their track record",Neutral
Intel,"-DLSS SR looks better than FSR.  -DLSS frame gen works better than FSR frame gen.  -Reflex is better than AMD’s antilag (and much more widely available)  -DLSS has support in MUCH more games than FSR, Specially DlSS 4 vs FSR 4.  -Path tracing is feasible in RTX GPUs that are 4070ti and above when using DlSS upscaling + frame gen while on AMD Path tracing is not really feasible even using upscaling and frame gen, the performance hit of path tracing is still to much for AMD even on a 9070XT.  -Ray reconstruction straight up doesn’t has an alternative on AMD, they don’t have something like it out  yet.  -power consumption efficiency on Nvidia is better.  -Day one driver support for new games is higher in Nvidia.  -Nvidia is still better for streaming.  There’s white a few things.  No fanboyism here, just a ton of facts that you ignored",Positive
Intel,"Lol no, no it's not. The stability of the drivers + large advantage in ray tracing and AI capability + longterm support are all huge advantages for Nvidia currently. I own both a 9070 xt and a 5070 ti, theyre both htrat cards, but if I could only have one for the next 5 years it would be the RTX card easily.",Positive
Intel,"That’s why the fact that Nvidia announced RTX neural compression wich has been shown to reduce VRAM usage UP TO 90% (Wich even if it ends up being 40%-50% is. Massive) coming soon 1 year ago, while AMD still relies on high VRAM wich we know they won’t be able to support with the new ram prices, will make Nvidia age much better.",Positive
Intel,"Depends on the market. Here where I'm at, 5070 is 40% cheaper than a 9070xt. And the 5070ti is 10% cheaper. It all depends where you're located. I hate these ""what should I buy"" threads on reddit where the location is obfuscated.",Negative
Intel,"While I agree it’s a valid point in favor of the 9070, honestly at their performance tier, the number of games where, at the resolution this GPUs are aimed for wich is 1440P and if triple A, upscaled 1440P. 16 is an advantage over 12 in very very small amount of games.  And seeing the RAM situation I don’t expect vram demands to increase at a normal pace during some years, I’m expecting stagnantion since, even if AMD says so, I highly doubt they’ll be able to mantain prices.  Maybe for half a year but eventually they’ll have to buy more Vram and prices are through the roof. High vram GPUs will be very expensive for some years now.  Whether nvidia or AMD both will be very expensive. So I wouldn’t be surprised if both corporations focused on low VRAM GPUs.  Wich means stagnantion.  What do you think?",Neutral
Intel,Never been an issue,Neutral
Intel,All the ones that said wait for supers… but now they’ll be ultra overpriced thanks to ai.  Can’t make shit up,Negative
Intel,The difference isn't $700 though. I have a friend who constantly buys and sells shit on marketplace. You're assuming he bought them both new and threw the old in the trash.,Negative
Intel,"I'll be honest mate, I agree with you. I personally only think an upgrade is worth it when you get a 20%+ performance increase. Like I've myself have battled with getting a 7800X3D when they go on sale (best sale I saw was \~$250 about 6ish months ago, was so hard not to pull the trigger), since the performance uplift from a 7600X, in CPU intensive games I play (strat games) isn't enough. Sadly I have an asrock board, pre-9XXXX release, and yeah with their issues with a 9800X3D, it isn't an option for me...  But you can sell a brand new GPU, esp a 5070, for a minor lose (ESP right now). And get a 9070XT. It isn't dropping $700+. It's dropping the difference of what you got used for your old GPU and the price of the new one. That could be $0-100, to get the GPU you wish you had got from the start. Which isn't too bad to many. AMD card also sell for cheaper used, it isn't that hard to sell a used Nvidia card and get an AMD card from the same gen, used, for almost the same price. Not long ago, I sold a 4070TI and got a Used 7900XTX and had some money to spare/made a profit. I wanted to play 4K and the 4070TI wasn't cutting it. I also got an amazing deal on a 2 week old 7900XTX, seller wanted better RT performance for Cyberpunk, and got a 9070XT.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure and I totally agree but they seem quite clear about just playing this game and I think something to highlight would be that they can save a bit of money by getting the 5070. It’s also going to be viable for other games of course it will, more than that they seem to be playing at 1080p for this particular game so I would suspect that they probably have a 1080p monitor and at that resolution you really don’t need a 9070 XT. I don’t know if CS2 is going to get updated with this, but Nvidia is also doing their reflex 2 framewarp which no one seems to know when it’s coming out, but if you are a competitive gamer, it’s probably a big deal. Honestly, I’m fascinated by the whole argument because it seems ridiculous to me to buy any of these modern midrange cards in order to play one game, but if that’s what OP wants to do, I guess it is.   They seemingly don’t show any interest in other games if they did the 9070 XT is obvious the better choice but that’s still overkill for a 1080p monitor where I do think that a 5070 is more reasonably specced with 12 gigs of VRAM going very far at that resolution and the performance being respectable. You should likely be able to play everything at like ultra settings and have a good experience on a 1080p monitor.",Positive
Intel,"I don't disagree that Nvidia has better features, but we've reached a point where AMD is catching up, which over a year ago wasn't even close.  FSR 3 was below DLSS 2, while FSR4 is somewhere between DLSS 3 and 4.  You get AMD if in your region you want a midrange card that's the best bang for buck possible, if it's priced correctly.  I disagree with the 7900 XTX being obsolete, you bought it before FSR 4 was a thing, in my opinion it still performs exactly the same. Perhaps some expected it to get a better upscaler, but even this is speculation.  Both Nvidia and AMD have been known to release new features only for their new cards. However AMD open source more, if it wasn't for them we'd still be paying for modules in monitors for G-Sync.",Neutral
Intel,I had a bunch of issues driver wise and compatibility wise with my 3070ti but no issues with my 6800xt.   I actually prefer the software and puts out for modifying the settings for each game.   I also don’t like ray tracing or frame generation on either platform though. I’d rather have the 100+fps,Neutral
Intel,"And yet AMD has better price to performance ratio in almost all games. While I agree nvidias AI features are better, the difference is not as big as it used to be. FSR4 is vastly superior to FSR3. Antilag (2) is also a very good option to Reflex, I've actually noticed a bigger difference than I did with reflex, but it does not work properly in every game, so some tradeoff there.   FSR does have less support in new/old games, but any major new release always has FSR in my experience.   Day one driver support being better on Nvidia isn't really relevant when they still have a lot of issues with games not fully utilizing the nvidia cards, and this has a big problem this last or two year for nvidia. You simply don't need day one driver support on AMD for most games. There's been numerous games where the 50XX series has had worse performance than the 40XX series in new games even with day 1 drivers.   So while I agree somewhat that Nvidia is higher quality in general, it's a lot more nuanced than you make it seem",Positive
Intel,"Few yeara Ago I brought my first nvidia gpu (3080) because of promises of great tech. Only nvidia tech I’ve used is nvnec, others are really gimmicks- frame gen increases input lag, DLSS I have never needed as I get decent fps without it, I tried it with space marine 2 but didn’t like the result. Second time I wanted to try dlss was with EFT but that game just has bad implementation of it. Also atleast on Linux amd drivers seems more stable, I’ve had issues after kernel update with nvidia.",Neutral
Intel,"He plays cs2 , only thing thats worth mentioning there is reflex , which is considered superior over antilag , but its not really a dealbreaker .  Op should focus on an X3D chip and a good monitor , + decent gpu , personaly i own a 9070xt and r5 7600 , and im happy with it , also CS2 only basicly , going with anything higher gpu wise is not worth it , cpu is what matters a lot in cs , expecialy X3D chips .",Positive

Intel,"There's also driver support to think about. Nvidia supports their cards for WAY longer than AMD does. AMD sometimes seems to randomly remove driver updates for certain cards.  I know AMD has an appealing price point and feature set on paper, but in real world testing I'd say Nvidia is the winner. Even if it looks like you'll get a bit worse performance, the security of knowing your card will be supported for years and years is worth a lot to me.",Neutral

Intel,"A brand new 5070 goes for about $600, so I’m the best case you’ll get $500 on the used market if you get lucky with Facebook marketplace goblins. So, $200 and a piece of your sanity for marginal uplift is still kind of a shit deal even before you consider the value of your time.",Negative

Intel,"Just in regards to fsr vs dlss, imo its less about the quality of the upscalers and more about adoption rate. The amount of games that natively support fsr vs dlss is like 10 to 1 in my experience. It does seem to be getting better, but my point is the fact of fsr becoming much better is moot when adoption rate is so low.",Neutral

I’m talking about Nvidia’s GeForce department publishing their demo of it in 2025 CES and announcing it as coming soon to RTX GPUs in fact it was supposed to be launched for the 5xxx series but seems it’s still not ready.  If anything they have more reason now than ever to invest on it, since with current ram prices, keeping high VRAM GPUs at prices that have any chance to sell in the consumer market seems impossible.  A feature that makes 8GB GPUs still feasible in 2027 is something they and every likely to focus on, since ram prices won’t go down any time soon",Neutral

Intel,"From what I can tell most new games support it, but titles that have been released already often do not.  That said, I'm someone who uses upscaling when a game is too demanding. I fully believe Native is the way to go, but I do see the value for upscaling, especially when framerate goes below an acceptable rate.  What I mean is, I expect a 4080s/5070 ti/9070 XT to run most titles already out there at max settings without upscalers. 4k might have more outliers, and there is of course path tracing, but in general I don't think it's a big issue.",Neutral
Intel,"Jeah but you are both right you know? :D   I'm more with NoCase on that one I love RT and PT and ""complete performance crippling"" isn't so much  of a concern anymore on Nvidia, still expensive! But I can play a lot of RT games without even DLSS on 60+.   That beeing said, if you don't care much fore RT and aren't a graphic whore like myself, it really doesn't matter much to a lot of people and you can easily just save a few bucks and go AMD.   i.E my flatmate has a 5070 and only plays Dota and civ lol he doesn't care about DLSS vs FSR or RT",Positive

Intel,my 2070 is still holding strong. In it for the long run,Neutral
Intel,At least your GPU is the recommended system requirements instead of the minimum requirements so it could run somewhat ok for you. *cries in GTX 1080*,Positive
Intel,"I'm one gen behind those, but I mostly just play Xenotilt and Demons Tilt, and other pinball games (and few shmups).  Edit- maybe not a full gen. Rocking a 5500 Radeon Xt 8gb oc. Pretty happy with it for what I play though.",Positive

Intel,Why optimize when you can just vibe-code?,Neutral
Intel,"I am hoping that one possible positive (?) from the RAM shortage is that developers will release games like this, less people buy due to requirements, forcing developers to better optimise their games.  It’s unlikely but fingers are crossed……",Positive

Intel,You can usually run games at quite a bit under minimum requirements. It's not something i'd worry about.,Neutral
Intel,"I will do you one better.  In the future, games will require that your GPU supports frame generation.",Neutral
Intel,This requirement is most likely with raytracing turned on. Turning it on results in these high requirements for even the most basic looking games.,Neutral
Intel,can‘t even blame people with not enough spare money switching to console at this point.,Negative
Intel,Not really. My old GPU wasn't even stated in minimum system requirements. Still I could play new games for like another 7 years.,Neutral

Intel,Y'all remember when lego games were actually optimized?,Neutral
Intel,Games need to chill out.,Neutral
Intel,"I replaced my 5700XT recently, glad I did. Let's hope the replacement lasts.",Positive
Intel,Imagine not even making minimum requirement list,Negative
Intel,"Im not saying this is good, just stating the potential reasons. The game uses UE5, which is already heavy out the gate, and those minimum specs line up with the PS5 and XSX.   So, given that the XSS is a thing lower than minimum, it will be viable for 30 fps at 1080p. I'd imagine.   Either the consoles are 1080p@60, and they're just using that as PC min spec, or they just chucked the equivalents as min spec even if they aren't the minimum to run it.",Neutral
Intel,Nothing is as bad as the AI sys requirements for indiana jones or whatever the fuck game that was. 🤣,Negative
Intel,"The game dev was definitely like ""this runs on my system buttery smooth, it will work everywhere else fine""  Meanwhile the Dev's pc is a workstation with four 4090 stack with liquid cooling",Neutral

Intel,Crypto Miner with some Lego gameplay™,Neutral
Intel,"I know the A770 isnt exactly a beast, but seeing a 16G VRAM card in the minimum specs is fucking wild.",Negative
Intel,"I never see my specs recommended now im worried that I bought bad parts =( why wont any game recommend my system specs?  /s  Fr though, the recommended specs never make sense. They never give a target or configuration for the minimum or recommended, so it ends up being meaningless. I always thought recommended specs should be controlled like nutritional facts on food are.  For example:  Cyberpunk 2077  Minimum (720p, 30fps, lowest settings, Fsr 3.1 performance) GTX 1030 Xxx Xxxxx Xxxx  Recommended (4k, 240fps, maximum settings, DLSS 4.5 performance, FG 2x, pathtracing enabled) RTX 5080 Xxx Xxx Xxxx",Negative
Intel,"I mean it’s game dependent.  I’ve seen my 4090 as recommended… But it was path traced Indiana Jones, so fair enough.  If I saw my 4090 being necessary for a Borderlands game THEN I would be worried… oh… wait….",Neutral

Intel,2070 as a minimum is ridiculous,Neutral
Intel,shit take,Negative
Intel,"It's a nearly 8-year-old GPU. The last Lego Batman game (2014) also had 8-year-old GPUs as its minimum specs (The NVIDIA 7600GS and ATI Radeon 1950, both released in 2006).   The recommended specs are slightly more generous than the last Lego Batman game: recommended was 4 to 5-year-old GPU's (GTX 480 and Radeon 5850), while the 3080 is nearly 6 years old.   You being uncomfortable with the passage of time has nothing to do with optimization. It's been more than a decade since the last game. Graphics improve. Not just the actual effects, but also the amount of stuff that can be rendered at once in a map.",Neutral
Intel,another unoptimized slop,Neutral
Intel,"I have the explanation.  You know how everyone was begging for a return of AA games, right? Everyone was fed up of only AAAs with inflated budgets and indies? People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card. But they don't want to be complained at if it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,NOOOOOOOO,Neutral
Intel,Minimum 3080 wow is it crysis,Neutral
Intel,The 3080 is 6 years old and the equivalent of a 5060 Ti which is a current gen mid range GPU. For such a card to appear in the recommended requirements is very reasonable if you ask me,Neutral
Intel,With requirements like that I better feel like I'm in Legoland watching a moving diorama,Neutral
Intel,Cant remember if it was in the Skywalker Saga Lego game but that shit looked amazing for it being Lego.,Positive
Intel,cant be rt or pt judging by how they put 3080 and 6800xt which are no where near comparable in that.  the game is just that fucking horridly made it seems...,Negative
Intel,But it will be *under* the system requirements…,Neutral
Intel,His won't but then mine will :(,Neutral
Intel,And then it'll hit minimum sys req and that's the end of it.,Neutral
Intel,UE5 does not like my 9070 I can tell you that much,Negative
Intel,I guess the question is if the recommended spec is for 4k ultra at 120fps. Then that makes more sense.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah Unoptimized Engine 5 is the worst.,Negative
Intel,UE5 will bring a 5080 to its knees if it does on of those close ups of a face.  What the fuck is up with that engine,Negative

Intel,It's time brother. I went from a 2060 to a used 3080 to a 5070 in the past 5 or so months. Massive difference.,Positive
Intel,"Indiana Jones was two years ago  We're all gettin old. But honestly Indiana Jones looks fuckin incredible and it uses RT for everything so it makes sense that the reqs would be kinda high. New DOOM game is also like that, and it runs crazy smooth.",Positive
Intel,Games stop being optimized when they can't run on the PC I built 5 years ago.,Negative
Intel,"Or when a graphics card started to appear in required specs.   Or when EverQuest released an expansion with a graphics upgrade, that recommended 256 RAM. Which found a lovely Windows bug, where versions older than XP could get lost in the RAM and freeze. Forcing the user base to need to upgrade windows",Negative
Intel,"To be fair Oblivion had a bunch of seriously stupid things going on, like massive texture files for random little prop rocks and the like. That sort of thing is very sloppy and it's not the kind of optimisation that costs anything to do. Bethesda's reputation isn't unearned.",Negative
Intel,For a bit of context on this. I had a 2 year old ATI X800 XT that couldn't run Oblivion properly. Todays equivalent would be a 4090 being only able to run a game on potato settings.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, pretty sure most games from 2006 would struggle with a GPU from 2000. The 3080 is over 5 years old now. I just replaced my 3080 a few weeks ago with a 9070 XT.",Negative
Intel,"I remember that, and bought a 7900gt for $330 to max it out, show me a top tear graphics card for the current equivalent price of $500 that can play the current oblivion remaster at max graphics.",Neutral
Intel,This is a lego game tho that doesn't look any better than previous lego games but requires 4 times the hardware power to do so,Negative
Intel,"I found one for 220 a week ago, but went for am5 instead. Should've bought it just to flip 💀",Negative
Intel,2070 is listed as minimum. 3080 is listed as recommended.,Neutral

Intel,8 year old GPUs now are much closer to modern GPUs than 8 year old GPUs were 8 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah no, this is a bad optimisation, a Lego game should run on a toaster. This is UE5 doing what it does best",Negative
Intel,"The problem is that how many factors of 2x power increase GPUs launched in that time, and also look at the CPU minimum spec which is really high compared to the old one. The older one could run on really old CPUs. The new one needs something released relatively recently. Not that this is an unfair ask but it's still high as a minimum.",Negative
Intel,"This a terrible comparison in so many ways. Much akin to people comparing gpu/cpu prices in the 00s to today.   Look, I don't expect the gtx 1080 to be running this game at ultra, but I kinda thought stuff like it would at least reach minimum requirements.    RTX 3080 recommended is crazy. Even the 5060 ti and rx 9060 XT are slightly slower.",Negative
Intel,A nearly 8 year old gpu that is more powerful than the 5060ti 16gb which isn’t even a year old…..,Neutral
Intel,"It has everything to do with optimization though, since lego games don't do bleeding edge technology graphics, besides it's 6yo high-end GPU. It's still better than 5060ti which is new gen",Positive
Intel,"It’s closer to the 5070 lol, especially the 12gb version which is only 10% or so slower than the 5070, much faster than a 5060ti.",Positive
Intel,Same with Lego Horizon on the PS5.,Neutral
Intel,"Dw, mine will too 😆",Positive
Intel,Ue5 is so bad on amd cards.,Negative
Intel,Doing fine for me,Positive
Intel,"it still doesnt make sense that way in my opinion, its a frigging lego game",Negative
Intel,"> We truly need to call bad craftmanship out more.  People really want 'Indy' or 'AA' games while demanding a degree of technical excellence that even most AAA productions can't afford...  E33 made an excellent compromise to deliver on its aesthetic.  You can't do this on the same budget with a custom or older engine, or at the very least take a huge risk that it just won't work out.  It takes much bigger studios to maintainwell optimised engines with modern feature sets that are suitable for general game development, like id with its id tech engine or Ubisoft's Anvil engine.",Negative
Intel,"Comparing a 2015 game to a 2025 game is kind of weird man idk.     Clair obscure runs decently on modern hardware, I've seen people with budget rtx4050 laptops running it.",Negative
Intel,"In which sense does Clair Obscur look like it should scale down nicely? It features all the standard photorealistic graphics and characters you'd expect from a high-end 2025 release, with a large amount of natural environments. I would expect it to scale down as well as, say, MGS Delta.",Neutral
Intel,RT isn't required in 99.9%+ of available games. I'll survive without the remainder. Those devs are choosing to make their games exclusive to a small portion of the market.,Neutral

Intel,Damn. Was it really two years?,Negative
Intel,"My kid's 2070 is *outraged*, *outraged, I tell you* but the kid just drops to medium or uses DLSS and he's happy.  Probably throw a 9060XT at him later this year.",Negative
Intel,"I remember buying Command and Conquer Generals only to find that I couldn't run it on my still fairly new PC. It often only took around 2-3 years for hardware to start becoming seriously obsolete.  Generals released in 2003 and required a DirectX 8.1-capable GPU with at least 32 MB VRAM. This ment it needed an Radeon 8500 or GeForce 4 from late 2001/early 2002. Radeon 7000 and GeForce 3 GPUs from 2001 were already outdated.  Those GPUs released at $299 MSRP. Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $550 today. So depending on how you want to compare prices, that's roughly on par with requiring an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 Super for a game released in 2025.  The fact that people now believe that games requiring 7 year old hardware is a sign of declining optimisation is kind of hilarious.",Negative
Intel,"Oh heck, don't remind me about Evercrack. I was on Windows 2000 at the time with 512 MB, so didn't see that particular issue!",Negative
Intel,I've got the original big box PC version of Everquest pre expansion and the list of recommended GPUs on the back is absolutely wild. Shit you've never heard of. Diamonds and Orchids and Matroxx this that and whatever.,Positive
Intel,"dudes who be yappin about ""games aren't optimized anymore!"" don't know shit about ""unoptimized"" games. GPUs from 3+ years ago are still completely viable today but back then a GPU that's a year old would barely be able to play anything new",Negative
Intel,"I was running a Radeon 9700 when Oblivion dropped, bought it in late 2002. It was the king of the hill, I had it overclocked slightly over 9700 Pro spec.  Oblivion *killed it*. Even on ""Medium"". Even at 1024x768. FPS was below 20 at all times and dropped into single figures when refraction shaders were used.  That'd be like an AAA game today running badly on an RTX 4080 or 4090 from 2022.",Positive
Intel,Gpu improvements have heavily stagnated. The 3080 is still stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and even trails the 4070 from last gen.,Neutral
Intel,you couldnt play games maxed out on $500 graphics cards even in 2005 without framerate dips.  as for now. a $500 5060ti 16gb running dlss 4.5 at balanced 1440p looks good and hits 60+fps.,Neutral
Intel,"It's a LEGO game now set in a larger open world and the visuals absolutely look more detailed than the last Star Wars LEGO game, which was set in smaller linear environments. Open world games just take more to render then closed environments do.   Like, I dunno what else to tell you. The 3080 is almost six years old. It's aging and it's perfectly natural that older GPUs move down into the ""recommended"" spectrum.",Positive
Intel,Thank u i was panicking. Still not great,Negative
Intel,"tbh for real, a lego game shouldn't be demanding this much lol. ue5's wid for this",Negative
Intel,What would you say is closest to a 3080ti?,Neutral
Intel,The 4070 super is about the same,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't something subjective, it's verifiable. According to TPU, the 5060 Ti is only 11% slower while the 5070 is 15% faster.   The requirements talk about the 10gb variant so that's the one I'm considering.   Iceberg Tech also made a video comparing the 3080 12gb and the 5060 Ti and they seemed to be close, so the 10gb variant would be closer.   I'm sure there are more benchmarks you can lookup to verify the performance of the cards and reevaluate your understanding based on the results",Neutral

Intel,Playing Horizon with my son right now and it looks amazing.,Positive
Intel,"Me, personally, have a much better time with ue5 games than I did on the 4070.  Less stuttery",Positive
Intel,UE5 is bad on all cards,Negative
Intel,Arena Breakout Infinite is UE5. It runs in 3440x1440 at over 200fps on my 7900XTX. It's buttery smooth so to say.   UE5 runs fine on AMD cards.,Positive
Intel,"Seriously. When folks do these comparisons of older games vs. newer games, it's always games that at the time they released were technical achievements from some of the biggest studios pushing the boundaries of what was possible at the time.   That often had not only outsized budgets, but development timelines relative to what a smaller team can afford.  It's like uh, yeah, the game looks good because they put an immense amount of time and labor into bespoke assets and toolkits to achieve a specific aesthetic within the boundaries of that period's hardware. (and oftentimes not even within those boundaries, but pushing beyond them like Arkham Knight)",Neutral
Intel,Truth. I had no issues when I had a GTX 1080 last year.,Positive
Intel,The fact you can play the majority of modern games on 10 year old hardware seems to say the opposite of the point you're making.,Negative

Intel,"RT capable cards have existed for eight years, if your PC rig doesn't have one it might be time for an upgrade ngl",Neutral
Intel,the 9060xt is pretty similar speed as it lacks dlss and fsr3 looks bad (unless the game supports fsr4). 9070 or 5070 are upgrades though,Negative
Intel,"And before Steam and indie games really took off we had a period of publishers dismissing all PC gamers as pirates. That era was full of just *atrocious* ports from consoles, if the publishers even bothered at all.    It was pretty much just Valve and Blizzard holding the PC flag for a while, and Bioware was at least good about adapting their UIs for PC (tactical mode in DAO, for example).",Negative
Intel,"I had ME at the time, and after adding ram to my system, I was soft locking about every 30-45 min.",Neutral
Intel,"Not to mention that a lot of the stutters of the Oblivion remaster are not because of UE5, but because the original Oblivion code still stutters on hardware from over 15 years later.  Asset streaming in open worlds is a hard problem. We live in a blessed time to treat the occasional shader compilation stutter in UE5 games a as a major issue.",Negative
Intel,I had a vanilla GeForce 6800 which I was able to unmask some extra pixel pipelines for extra performance. Not sure if I ever played Oblivion on that though because I played it a couple years after release. I might've played it with my next build with the GeForce 9800 gt.,Neutral
Intel,It doesn’t matter how old the 3080 is. It’s not a weak gpu by any means. It’s like 10% stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and only slightly trails the 4070 for comparison.,Positive
Intel,Eh I blame developers just as much,Negative
Intel,"12gb 3080 and 3080ti are essentially the same performance, so the closest equivalent would be a base 4070 and 4070 super or 5070",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah there are a lot more advantages to the 3080(like its near 2x bus), and there are 2 variants of the 5060ti... don't know ""iceberg tech""... so wont speak to that.  When looking at either. We see that when in RT, the 3080 just smacks the crap out of the 5060ti 8Gb, and makes the 5060ti 16GB do a very good impression of the french. Only winning when it can leverage the 16GB Vram buffer, which is predominantly 4k, which is not a great res for that GPU anyway.",Neutral
Intel,"Tech power up isn’t accurate down to the perctanges like that, it’s more of a rough idea on where the perf of a card stacks up.   In real world benchmarks and game testing at 1440p/4K the 3080 is much closer to the 5070.   You even said that the 3080ti is closest to the 4070 super, which is correct. The 12gb 3080 is essentially the same thing as a 3080ti in perf, and a 4070 super is around 5070 perf too, so you basically agree with me already.",Neutral
Intel,haha. Lego Horizon Adventures to fully clarify!,Positive
Intel,"Probably able to just brute force it a bit more, I found I had a better time when I went with the x3d chip from my 12th gen i5. The stutters hit less frequently recovered much faster than the gpu upgrade",Positive

Intel,I mean 7900 XTX is still tied for like 8th best amongst non-commercial cards.  Its kind of a beast.,Positive
Intel,"There are definitely examples of ue5 that run fine on amd cards, but there are a lot that don’t.",Neutral
Intel,Worse than a game at max settings? Well yeah. A game from 2014 at lowest also looked worse than a maxed out 2004 game. Maxed out 1440p half life 2 vs lowest settings 720p shadow of Mordor (which was considered a good looking game on release…not so much later). Half life 2 clears.  It’s been like that for a very long time. Basically ever since graphics settings.,Negative
Intel,I think we're saying the same thing? Only a small number of recent games require RT.,Neutral
Intel,"And the physical hardware was so low quality.  GPU didn't even need a 12VHWPR connector to frequently fail within 2-3 years, because capacitors, coolers, PSUs, and the general build quality were so bad. [This thing was a $299 card in 2002](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce4-ti-4400.c180), and it's not like high-end cards were built much better. Even on a purely physical level, it's awesome how much better built a [modern equivalent like the 5060 is.](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060.c4219)  I lost 2 GPUs to those dreaded flickering polygons (afaik indicating that some memory cell or data channel had broken) just in the 3-4 or so years I was playing World of Warcraft.  Not to mention the buzzing audio because most cables and speakers broke easily. I had to weigh down the cable of my speakers to make up for a partial cable break constantly, and had buzzy sound every summer when temperatures went up.",Negative
Intel,Whoever said it's *weak*? It's now a mid-range GPU. It is *literally the recommended GPU* for this game.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for the insight 🤝,Positive
Intel,Is HUB a big enough channel for ya? Their review puts the the 5060 Ti 11.5% behind the 3080 12gb at 1440p so within 10% of a 3080 10gb. I would not call that a smacking.   I'm not saying that the 5060 Ti is a good card or that the 3080 10gb is bad. All the comparisons I'm saying indicate that they're reasonably close to each other and that's about it,Neutral
Intel,"The post specifically mentions the 10gb variant of the 3080 though. HUB's 5060 Ti puts it 10% slower than a 4070/3080 12gb at 1440p as well, and the 10gb variant is a few percent slower.

Intel,"That's funny, because of course both Indiana Jones and Doom TDA at max settings run *much* better on your GPU than Control does. Because they have 'forced RT' so the games are actually built to *properly utilize* it, unlike Control which has the nice non-forced RT everyone loves - because it's bolted onto the existing engine and runs like crap. Just like *every* game that has RT bolted on runs like crap when it's enabled.",Positive
Intel,"I had one of the earlier fan cooled GPUs, and it had the bearing in the fan fail. It rattled for a bit, then the card died.   I remember all the issues with audio drivers, and it being generally recommended to have a separate sound card to get better stability for games",Negative
Intel,What I meant was the guy I was replying to says it’s perfectly natural for a 6 year old gpu to be seen in the recommended. Kinda insinuating that the 3080 is an older less powerful card that should be relegated to this status. Despite it being stronger than the less than a year old 5060ti,Neutral
Intel,"Again, what 5060ti...  You used a source. I used the exact same source. When you actually dive into the specific results, the ""12%"" average.

Intel,9800s only recently came out and honestly even the 5800x3d is still a premium chip. You wouldn’t be putting yourself in a bad position if you grabbed any x3d chip,Neutral
Intel,"Sure, but also it *is* an older less powerful card. It's simply relegated from a flagship status to midrange - while 5060Ti although more recent was of course midrange to begin with.",Neutral
Intel,You can't just grab a CPU and call it a day. Moving from LGA 1700 to AM4 would be monumentally stupid. He can already upgrade to CPUs equal to the 5800X3D on the existing platform.,Negative
Intel,"Of course he can, I was just on the same train of thought of I upgraded to an x3d chip.",Neutral
Intel,You upgraded to AM5 which makes sense. The 5800X3D isn't an upgrade over the best Intel CPUs.,Neutral

Intel,Do ARC GPUs work well on Linux? I didn't know.,Neutral
Intel,"More VRAM than you need is better than running out of VRAM. The GPU itself is somewhere in the neighborhood of 4060/4060Ti territory, so it's certainly capable of outrunning 8GB, which would result in a horrible, stuttery mess",Positive
Intel,Feel like it's probably the best option at that price if you're scared of used GPUs at least (not that there much competition),Positive
Intel,The opposite of everything you just said is true. Drivers are stable now. It saturates 12 GB of VRAM if playing at higher resolutions. And it actually is not great for Linux if you intend to game.   Intel has good compute for like hosting an LLM on Linux but similar to Nvidia has a pretty substantial performance hit on Linux for gaming. Not quite as bad as Nvidia but nowhere near as plug-and-play as AMD on Linux.,Negative

It is true Intel has open source drivers which is nice, but it’s still not a “good” choice for Linux gaming.   Intel does not invest into Linux gaming at all. They even said this blatantly in a recent interview with Digital Foundry.   If you genuinely care about having a good experience on Linux with no headaches, you need AMD sadly.",Negative
Intel,"On Linux it is mostly Nvidia who is troublesome when it comes to drivers. It is generally better now than before, but getting Nvidia drivers is still a pain in the ass if you want legacy drivers.   Arc and Radeon run great on Linux but game compatability is still not perfect. But that is not a driver issue but a game issue.   Most developers don't release Linux versions still so you need a specialised translation layer between Linux and the game. The funny thing is that even while using the translation layer some games run better on Linux than on Windows.",Negative
Intel,"On windows, no. The opposite of everything that guy said is true.",Neutral

Intel,Since i play on 1080p and i don t have access to dlss i don t use any kind of upscaling but i have to say that for anti aliasing xess is far better than fsr and especially tsr,Positive
Intel,"You want it to max the 12GB? I can't just tell it to do that, I need to load enough stuff in the game so it maxes the VRAM.  I don't understand your logic. VRAM is like RAM, more chrome tabs, more RAM. So more of the map being rendered/more stuff in the game, more VRAM. Where did you hear otherwise?",Negative
Intel,"Most graphics cards go from 8 GB of VRAM to 12 GB, with very few offering an intermediate amount. If he is using 9.7 GB, that means that an 8 GB card would be too little, making the upgrade to 12 GB necessary.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause I didn't load enough game at once. Holy shit it's like saying ""ah your pc is too weak and cannot use all 64 gigs at once"" while you just started windows. Like ofc you didn't open anything that will take up RAM. If I loaded up a city with 100 000 population I might max the VRAM because I am loading even more things up.

Intel,"Don't sleep on xess 2, as I said it's been very good in terms of quality for me  I guess at 1080 you don't need it, but if some game can't write reach 60 or whatever your target is, definitely try it on ultra quality",Positive

Intel,"Ok but your comment is still missing the point. Say someone said ""this car can't go faster than 120km/hr"" your reply is basically ""wdym it can't go over 120km/hr? I literally drive mine on the autobahn. I get 100km/hr"". See the issue?",Neutral
Intel,"Well that is mostly because their are mobile parts, so it will always be unfair to compare them to desktop parts.",Negative
Intel,"That's was I was saying, the availability is bad. It was bad even at launch",Negative
Intel,"Wasn't the GeForce 8000 series the first to come out with CUDA support?  At least as far as gaming cards, I'm not real familiar with Quadro stuff.  I had an 8800GT back in '07 and I remember talk about how GPUs would one day be useful for so much more than just gaming.",Neutral

Intel,Ok I'll give it a look thanks!,Positive
Intel,"I'm getting ragebaited rn 😭  VRAM works just like RAM.  If you have a computer that has 32 gigs of RAM, maybe you need to open 1000 chrome tabs to use all 32 gigs of RAM.  If I have a game where more population of the city means more things to be loaded. It means that more population eats up more VRAM. I had a city with 60K pop, means it eats up 9.7gigs of VRAM when I am loading up that size city. If the city was let's say 100K, it's gonna be bigger which means more things to load which means more VRAM used which means potentially maxxing out the VRAM of my GPU.  Also if you didn't know this, maxxing out the VRAM of a GPU is not preferable as it brings stutters. That's why 8gigs of VRAM is not seen as enough these days. Because if I played my game on a 5050, it would start stuttering because I am maxxing the VRAM on that GPU.  Sigh",Neutral
Intel,"Bait or mental retardation, call it",Neutral
Intel,But he didn’t say it utilizes 12 GB of VRAM.,Neutral
Intel,"Sure but they don't sell 9.7gb cards, as far as I know it currently goes 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 3.5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 32, 48.",Neutral
Intel,"The game uses 9.7 GB which is more than 8 GB, am I correct? How many graphics cards with 9.7 GB of VRAM do you know,? Asking that, because 9 GB in this case is too little and 10 GB would be underutilized according to your impeccable logic🤣",Neutral
Intel,"Dont overthink it, its just classic internet people confidently asserting stuff they have no understanding of",Negative
Intel,"Not necessarily. While it's not common, there are games and settings that will appreciate the additional 2 GB of VRAM the B580 offers, and the B580 will have enough power play at these settings at 60+ FPS.  TLOU2 at 1080p Very High is an example of this. It needs [at least 11 to run smoothly](https://youtu.be/1miEsftnFI4?t=447) (the 1080 Ti has stable but slow frametimes), and the B580 can get an [average of 80 FPS natively.](https://youtu.be/lLe5AP6igjw?t=611)",Positive
Intel,Out of all the comments you chose that one?? I understand that the GPU has to be strong because I can't be just using 12gb VRAM at 5fps. But guess what? I use 10gb VRAM at 30fps and I have some breathing room of 2gb because if you didn't know if you max out the VRAM in a GPU then your game starts stuttering. Like bro the b580 has a great amount of vram. The RTX 5060 is stronger but it would perform worse in my game since it only has 8 GB so idk what your end goal is here. To prove that the b580 only needs 8?,Negative
Intel,"Well, yes, but comparatively to other mobile parts like Z2 extreme chips they have performance issues on Linux.  That’s kind of unfortunate I think because Intel makes some really killer mobile chips that I would love to use but I don’t want to use Windows on these mobile devices preferably.",Negative
Intel,"Still who would buy them? I prefer the 9060xt for just a bit more to get something far better, I just don't see the appeal",Negative
Intel,"I'm not sure which one is the first one to come out with CUDA support, but the GTX580 was the first one people actually managed to run deep learning models on successfully  It's worth bearing in mind that pre 2012, the mathematics, datasets and architectures of neural networks hadn't really developed enough to take full advantage of GPUs  The software frameworks were also very limited back then. It's not just CUDA you need. It's a bunch of CUDA accelerated frameworks like CuBLAS, CuRand. CuDNN etc.  Nvidia has put a lot of work into developing all of those frameworks over the last decade and a half",Neutral
Intel,"I guess it even longer. It's actually ""XFX SPEEDSTER SWFT 210 AMD Radeon RX 7600 Core Edition"" Holy shit",Negative
Intel,"The point is that the actual speed of a B580 is more likely to be the bottleneck than its amount of VRAM.   Let say I have a big car. The car's trunk has room for 1000 bricks but the car's engine can only do 100 HP. The car can indeed carry 1000 bricks at once but it won't be able to drive very fast with 1000 bricks in the trunk. If you are very patient in trafic you could tolerate driving with all 1000 bricks at once, but most of us would rather carry fewer bricks and drive faster.  That it the same situation as with the B580 (but depends on the game). You could have a very large world with many building and people all loaded at once, but the GPU is not fast enough to also get you above 60 FPS.  If you can tolerate driving a big car very slowly, then good for you. Patience is a virtue after all.",Neutral
Intel,"The original comment says that the card has issues with utilizing the full 12 GB of VRAM, then this guy commented on it saying ""what do you mean it's not fast enough to use the 12 GB of VRAM?"" Then proceeded to provide an example if it only using 9.7 GB of VRAM... He could have easily provided an example of another game that uses the full 12 GB of VRAM.... Instead he provided an example of it using 9.7gb VRAM. Maybe I'm confused but it sounded like he was trying to provide an example to counter the original claim of it not using the full 12 GB of VRAM. Which he should have provided an example that used closer to the full 12 GB of VRAM, he could have used a different game that was more graphically intense to do so",Negative
Intel,"holy moly its like 9.7 is the theoretical limit the game can use. No, it will use more the more I play. Thats why having 12GB is great cause you have a bit of breathing rooom.",Positive
Intel,"One skill I'm really proud of in myself is my IRL ability to admit when I don't know something. Although I rarely actually say that on the Internet, because if I don't know something, I just don't leave a comment.",Negative

I would say 10gb would probably be best to make it a bit cheaper, since 95% of people getting such a budget card are not running 4k games that will utilise 12gb. also  >Out of all the comments you chose that one??  yeah. I chose that one, because it was the first one you made in the chain, and the one I first specifically replied to. Am I supposed to dig up random ones instead?",Negative
Intel,"I wanted an A310 for an old PC that I have, way better than a Radeon RX 550. Sadly, that won't happen",Negative
Intel,"wowie this is the second car analogy. But actually damn your analogy is so much better than the last guy's. Yes this makes a lot of sense I understand!!! And yes I can tolerate driving a big car slowly, just like how I said, 20-60 FPS while using 9.7GB in 4K which is still impressive imo. But if it was a 5050 and I maxxed the VRAM, then my game would have bad 1% lows and start stuttering a lot, forcing me to turn down the graphics or resolution. So I think 12GB VRAM is perfect for the B580, 8GB is too little in my opinion. As well because I do use more than 8GB.",Positive
Intel,mmmm maybe the secret is using premium instead of regular maybe thatll make my VRAM go up! :D,Neutral
Intel,“Maybe I’m confused”  Yes.,Neutral
Intel,"I was just playing into their comment, obviously having a buffer is nice but even if 9.7gb was the maximum the game could use, there isn't a card that exists with that configuration it's either 8gb or 12gb",Negative
Intel,"Ok and if I played my game for a bit longer than I would use even more than 9.7gb and my game will stutter if I had 10gb VRAM. But what's nice is the B580 has 12GB and I still have a decent amount of breathing headroom. Btw cities Skylines came out in 2015, what if I want to play an even more modern and unoptimized game? That 12gb VRAM is amazing for that situation. I really don't understand what you want, I personally bought mine for 300 euros and you can't get 12gb VRAM anywhere else for that price. Also outside of gaming, productivity work eats up a lot of VRAM and this makes the b580 a good option for people who build a pc for work.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe look for something similar that's used (with some luck) idk what else you could do on that situation,Neutral
Intel,Like I said maybe I'm confused,Neutral
Intel,My main point here is that your original comment was poorly worded and pretty dumb.,Negative
Intel,"Is a PC that has ocasional use, not the main. I wanted it low power too to not have to change the PSU, the Arc A310 was perfect for it.",Positive
Intel,You can look up compatibility on the PC builder site.   I got a Z790 for 125$   I got the I5-14600Kf for 150$   It holds up really nice.  BE REALLY CAREFUL the Intel GPUs need REBAR so keep your eyes peeled for that.,Positive
Intel,"Must be nice to have a MC, my closest is a few thousand miles away.",Positive
Intel,intel 13th and 14th gen have cpu failures so only buy if you are willing to risk that,Negative
Intel,Totally forgot about the rebar. Thanks for the reminder. My current cpu and mobo support rebar and I have it activated. Definitely something I’ll have to consider when I upgrade to ddr5,Positive
Intel,Would 12600kf for 100 be good?,Positive
Intel,A few thousand miles? Sorry that sucks. Their bundles/combos on parts are better than sex sometimes.,Negative
Intel,I mean.. CPUs are pretty far ahead of GPUs at least in terms of gaming.   Unless you planned on running 1440 with everything on ultra the B580 is great on most games. You’ll never feel like you are forced to run a game on low graphics.,Positive
Intel,If you plan on investing in Intel GPUs I would press you to get the newest gen.   Intel ARC B580 which is an entry Intel GPU didn’t play nice with older Intel Chips   12600 would hold up just fine.,Positive
Intel,Thanks there’s also the brand new core ultra 5 225f with bf6 for 150 on amazon. Would ultra core be a better fit?,Positive
Intel,If you don’t plan on upgrading it’s fine but if Intel releases a newer card that more powerful it might get bottlenecked.,Neutral
Intel,Dang maybe am5 cpu is better,Neutral
Intel,I’d say to go AMD.   Intel royally fucked up in that race but since they did have a major price drop because of it I scooped one up cheap.,Neutral

Intel,"Micro Center bundle, only 1 stick... I asked for 2 8s but they said it would ruin the deal...",Neutral
Intel,"Then, I found the Arc B570 for cheaper + its a newer and faster GPU",Positive
Intel,"Intel doesn't have the most stable drivers compared to the AMD and Nvidia, and their dx12 support for flight sims might actually make it worse than the 6600",Negative
Intel,"Intel Arc drivers + CS is a rough combo. Arc has gotten better, but esports titles are still hit or miss. FPS swings are kinda expected",Negative
Intel,"Monitor?  A bog standard (cheap) 1080p monitor may not go over 60 hz,",Neutral
Intel,yeah might as well sell the whole pc and try to build a different one idk if the cpus bottlenecking or if its the gpu,Neutral
Intel,i think he has a 180hz acer monitor,Neutral
Intel,That's about what you can expect in that game,Neutral
Intel,"you are playing at fhd on a 4k gpu, up the resolution and shift more of the work onto the gpu, not the cpu. at fhd its ur cpu doing most of the work. you need to match ur monitor to ur rig.",Neutral
Intel,Playing at 1080p with a 5080 is kinda strange. You're gonna be CPU bottlenecked and only using 2/3 of your GPU. Would be better off with 5070 and beefier CPU at that resolution.,Negative
Intel,"In warzone that’s just your cpu limit. Don’t know about arc raiders but 200fps sounds realistic on a 14700k. The NVIDIA drivers and DLSS overhead is a real issue in cpu limited scenarios and games, often resulting in a 5-10% additional performance hit compared to similar performaning amd cards. (One of the reasons why a 9070xt matches a 5080 in battlefield 6 when tested correctly)   You likely can’t do much besides increasing visual settings. This won’t make your fps go higher but at 1080p you’ll be cpu bound anyways so you can at least enjoy better visuals xD   Or get a 9800x3d for a nice 30-40% gaming performance improvement",Negative
Intel,What resolution are you playing at?,Neutral
Intel,Play on 1440p instead of 1080p.  That processor is not for 1080p gaming.,Neutral
Intel,Why do you use dlss performance on a fullhd? Just render game in native...,Neutral
Intel,if you cant hold 200 set it to 180 capped or 165 set monitor hz rate to 165 sweet spot is 165,Neutral
Intel,i have drops down to 200 on rebirth with a tuned 14700k and a 5090 since the last update lmao. same fps on 2k and 4k.,Neutral
Intel,I get 100 fps on a 5600x 7700 xt....,Neutral
Intel,Yes BIOs is to newest available Fw.,Neutral
Intel,You need an X3D CPU if you want 200+ fps in 1080p. Your CPU is more suited for singleplayer games with RT at high resolutions.  Intel CPUs are garbage for competitive games.,Neutral
Intel,If you want more go x3d,Neutral
Intel,FULL HD,Neutral
Intel,"That's not how it works. Increasing resolution doesn't inherently take load off the CPU. What actually reduces CPU load is lowering the number of frames the system is trying to produce. When you raise the resolution and the GPU can't render as many frames, CPU load will drop as a side effect, but that's due to the reduced framerate, not the resolution increase itself.  If you cap the FPS to, say, 60 at both 1080p and 4K (assuming the GPU can handle both), the CPU workload will be the same. The CPU's job is tied to how many frames it has to prepare, not the resolution those frames are rendered at. When you're CPU limited, it means the processor is already producing as many frames as it can. Raising the resolution won't magically allow it to produce more frames, it just risks shifting you into a GPU bottleneck instead. That can make utilisation graphs look ""healthier"", but it's impossible for it to increase FPS, since you were already at the limit.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah that looks about right, at least for arc raiders that's right where it should be with dlss, sitting a bit below 200",Neutral
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral
Intel,Amd really doesn’t gaf about anything other than data centre these days,Negative
Intel,Idgaf when Strix Halo products are nowhere to be seen (notebooks),Neutral
Intel,"Except that the B390 will be far more common as it will be seen in far more laptops. Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive
Intel,"AMD is at the point where Intel was before they went down the route and are recovering, history repeats before it's too late.  Not going to believe either until we get actual benchmarks and results.",Negative
Intel,Meanwhile AMD keeps putting out new chips with years old GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Core Ultra 2 is already a better mobile soc.  I don't know why AMD thinks 12-16 cores is more important than battery life when it comes to laptops.,Neutral
Intel,It does sound complacent but ultimately the proof is in the pudding.,Neutral
Intel,"If it is not even fair to compare (because Strix Halo is WAY more watts) then why is AMD comparing them? B390 will exist, Strix Halo virtually does not in laptops.",Negative
Intel,"AMD is playing the same intel book a few years ago. Except now instead of 14nm+++++++, it is RDNA 3.5555555.",Neutral
Intel,The Intel igpu has a better upscaler by far. FSR3.1 is a third class competitor in comparison. People have been crying out for AMD to release FSR4 for RDNA3.5 but AMD has some seriously stupid execs in charge.,Negative

Intel,Don't they already have an integrated GPU that's on par with an RTX 4060? According to Framework?,Neutral
Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel stays competitive and AMD also brings its best to the table.,Positive
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral
Intel,amd unfazed? I bet they are talking big shit again then will get absolutely demolished (as it happened with vega too),Negative
Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Positive
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Negative
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Positive
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral
Intel,"So AMD having much faster iGPUs for decade or more did not do much.  But now Intel rolling out something at unknown price/power package will absolutely decimate AMD.  Regardless of what will happen, ""AMD's fault"" indeed. (amazing silicon designers and experts at everything posting for free on reddit have convinced me)",Negative
Intel,"Laptops haven't really been AMD's focus, and apart from Zen1, AMD's focus has been mostly on data center, with desktop being the natural offshoot.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah they ain't immune to being complacent.  And bad press doesn't make Intel stay bad.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, their leaders aside from Ms. Su are all holdovers from AMD almost bankrupt times. Software sucks, graphics sucks, and now they are taking CPU down the drain too with high prices. Shitty leaders, lead to shitty outcomes.   They post high useless benchmark numbers no one cares about. They cannot compete with Apple in terms of battery life, and get creamed at low power levels.",Negative
Intel,"News at 10: ""Companies prioritise profits""",Neutral
Intel,"so either AMD doesn't have the capacity to produce them, or OEMs aren't interested, neither option is a compelling reason for AMD to focus on mobile",Negative
Intel,"We’d wish they were, but they’re not. Intel was struggling on all fronts due to their fabs. Amd is actually moving super fast in data centre so both epyc and instinct which is where they believe their money will be. They just don’t care to do anything in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"Halo is so much faster that the upscaler difference doesn't matter at all. Of course, it is probably also bigger.",Positive
Intel,"Yes, Strix Halo",Neutral
Intel,And having fsr4 supported in mobile at all,Neutral
Intel,FSR 4+ may be great but game support (number of titles + GPUs supported) is embarrassingly low,Negative
Intel,Dlss 4.5 not that great in my opinion. It fixes some ghosting but creates more shimmering because it has so much sharpening. I had to dial back to 4.0.,Negative
Intel,wildcat lake.  only issue it seems to be using 2 P cores and 4 LPE cores instead of E + LPE,Neutral
Intel,70% faster being “barely eke out a win”? Go ask why amd is stuck with 18 month old architecture despite intel managing to replace arrow lake after 12?,Negative
Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.   Being power efficient opens up a lot of form factors to be able to game with such as thin and light laptops, tablets, or gaming handhelds",Neutral
Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.   That's why it's silly to be a ""fan"" or ""supporter"" of one company or the other.  They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.  Realistically speaking, it's easy to make the case that on a 7""-9"" screen the 40 CUs is way overkill.  There's still room for a middle ground that Intel could easily fill.",Negative
Intel,"Absolutely consumers win when competition is hot, AMD has a bit too much of a lead ATM so they are cashing in and getting lazy. That said I am glad they are having their day, only because a few years ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and I really want to see them on a fairly level playing field with Intel... If we end up with 2 juggernauts training blows, having big resesrch budgets, etc we'll get lots of innovation and competitive pricing.",Neutral
Intel,"You had to shovel $1k for a 8 core CPU for about a decade, before AMD came.  So ""it just hiked the price"" is BS.  AMD cannot keep prices low while TSMC, effective monopolist, keeps posting record profits quarter after quarter.",Negative

Intel,AMD has always been like this. The OG Athlon FX line from ~22 years ago were $1000 CPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Wasn't it equivalent more or less to the 4050m as it was power limited to 30 watts?,Neutral
Intel,"It's the price of the final product that will matter.  And given that Intel has lion's share of the mobile market, I don't see why the would not ask outrageous $$$ for it.  It is ""impressive"" only in the ""for iGPU"" context.   Based on the benches shown, laptops were consuming around 60W.  While AMD""s 370 HX has been shown to be able to game at below 20W, so uh.  Let's bait for wenchmarks in any case.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure, sure.  I'm going to wait for proper benchmarks done under lab conditions and documented by more than ""Intel let me run this game with the FPS counter on.""

Intel,This. Plus even lunar lake outperformed Strix Point in many scenarios already. Intel is at least one generation ahead here,Positive
Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.

Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Would really appreciate the feedback, because I have the same card and I'm thinking on switching to 1440p but I don't know what monitor would be good refreshrate-wise",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly? Pretty decent deal for a 8GB model, considering how the 16GB cost around 450$ these days, almost double the price.",Positive
Intel,"Well yeah, the cheapest RX 9060 XT 16GB is [$380](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=596&sort=price&page=1&P=11811160064,51539607552) and the cheapest RTX 5060 TI 16GB is [$430](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#sort=price&P=11811160064,51539607552&c=593). When you're comparing $300 GPUs, you're not going to bring up a GPU that's nearly another hundred dollar.",Neutral
Intel,"That would be a completely new phenomenon if you look at the past. Sure, some (probably indie) studio will optimize their games, but they would have done so already because they care about their customers.  Nothing will change with the current devs or tech, it's just a temporary issue that memory is that expensive. The prices will be lower in 2027, or we'll get used to it and buy more expensive stuff.",Neutral
Intel,"6 ish year old product that is out of warranty from some rando, is not exactly comparable here and definitely not a ""real answer""",Negative
Intel,"Dunno why you're being downvoted, the 2080 Ti is still very good value for the price and often has good OC headroom. Beats 5060 in most cases and you're right about 11GB being decent",Positive
Intel,The real answer is to stop being cheap and spend money on your hobbies.,Negative
Intel,you tell us,Neutral
Intel,Why do power requirements matter?   Electricity costs pennies,Neutral
Intel,So many think memory bandwidth matters more than it does. The 5060 ti has less bandwidth than the B580. Architecture matters a lot.  More bandwidth would do next to nothing for it.,Neutral
Intel,AMD cards have upscaling and framegen as well...,Neutral
Intel,"Can you elaborate what do you mean by ""AI speed""?",Neutral
Intel,No. Dlss and frame gen is much less impactful in terms of performance boost at the low end and the latency is more noticeable. It’s also half the vram.,Negative

Runs very cool and quiet, never hitting above 65°C on closed room 20°C ambient temperature, my case sounds the same as a 20"" metal fan at speed 1, which is the same white noise that helps me sleep at night, an upgrade compared to my old RX 6600 during the summer lol.  Not sure if this helped or way too late, just wanted to comment anyways.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah seriously, here b580 is noticably cheaper for example.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I just wanted to point it out because there’s people like me to whom prices in dollars means nothing (or who don’t read the title) and then waste time watching an irrelevant video (though I skipped to the conclusion so not that much time).🙂",Negative
Intel,"Point being? If a cap blows because it's old any repair shop can fix it, If it's a fan dying you can fix that yourself.  On the other side there's not much the warranty can do for running out of VRAM.",Negative
Intel,"In this economy? It doesn't make any sense to not keep perfectly usable hardware that does the job just fine out of a landfill.   A 2080ti or a 3070 or AMD equal is more than enough performance for most people. Easily, and is way better bang for your buck.",Neutral

Intel,"They're seemingly referring to the speed of running LLMs locally using that GPU, unless I'm also out of the loop. A good sub to look into that stuff would be /r/LocalLLM   I wouldn't recommend doing that with a 5060 but the 16gb version must be the best choice in that price range and would handle the very small models easily and the small ones with a little slowness.",Neutral
Intel,"News flash: We're always in ""this economy"". I know someone who works at a fucking McDonalds, has a kid, and spends more money on his hobbies than you do.",Negative
Intel,nothing global about it,Negative
Intel,"So you prefer low power for lower heat and smaller size.   I'm not space conscious, so those things don't matter.   What's with messy cables? The PC sits under the table, so it also doesn't matter how ugly it is.",Negative
Intel,"Well actually people have been modding games to put FSR where neither AMD or NVIDIA added official support.   Pretty much every game had amd nvidia and even intel upscaling these days.   In fact, when i still had my 3080ti, i was able to use AMD’s framegen in many games (cyberpunk, dying light, talos principle) because NVIDIA didnt provide any option for 3000 series.   I still bought nvidia because amd doesnt offer any cards at 5080 level, so no brainwashing here. You’re completely uneducated blinded by consumerism",Neutral

Intel,"the unhinged extra power cables attached to the card itself, it makes everything harder to handle  and heat isn't just about the size of the case, it's noise and comfort of the room  and no, AC doesn't solve that as it's another source of noise that is even worse than the PC itself, only to be used when the weather is too bad to live otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Oh yeah? And who do you think had went through hundreds of accounts taking about that mod?   Came out DEC 22 2023 I remember the day I went from 22fps in Alan wake 2 to 50 (3070). I posted in this site non stop ban after ban just to try and get you this information. Go on the forums you will pick me out if you look back.   I, in all seriousness, would not be surprised if you know about that mod from ME.   Therefore, I am not blinded. I simply understand that an entire company propped up by manipulation on social media (and GPU) should not exist, and a real competitor would be in their place. There I have just demonstrated that not only am I not blinded, it might be you. Good on you for knowing about that mod (serious).   I will tell you another secret, maybe not meant for you. If you don't mind using dlss and mfg? 5060ti 16gb all day for 1440p or lower.

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.  I remember you mentioning on the AMD forums once that you want to be hit up about VR related issues - but really I didn't know how else I would reach out to you.",Negative

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik It says ""Intermittent application freeze when using the in-game Radeon™ Overlay."" in fixed issues but I've actually had my whole system lock up because of what seemed to be adrenalin having issues with the performance overlay....  I noticed one thing that pointed towards the overlay specifically: I was going through Adrenalin and when I was on the recording tab I switched to performance; it seemed like Adrenalin froze so I clicked Smart Tech. to see if it would respond.  Initially it didn't, before eventually swapping to the smart technology screen. I then went back to the record tab and tried again: same results.  That's about all I've got for specific steps. I closed Adrenalin and went back to doing whatever and I noticed my fans turned on and like two minutes later when I went to close my browser my cursor stopped before I got to the corner of my screen and I needed to hard power down my system.

Intel,25.9.1 works on my 9070 XT. Everything after that is a mess for me,Negative
Intel,Tagging u/AMD_Vik  so they are aware of the issues.       I encountered the same problems on my 6800xt. Figma on chrome is causing random BOSD. The system will just restart without notice. Every single web app seems unstable on my system and memory usage is all over the place. Rolling back to 25.9.1 doesn't fix everything but it eliminates 70% of the issues..,Negative
Intel,Oh well. :/  Funny thing is I rebooted my PC again for a Windows update. The first thing that greeted me after opening a web browser was the driver giving up the ghost.  On 25.11.1.,Negative

I'd rather get ripped off by NVDA and not have constant headaches.",Negative
Intel,"Which driver are you currently on? I'm just curious; personally, I'm on 25.9.2, and surprisingly, I have 0 problems, unlike with previous versions. Should I try 25.12.1?",Negative
Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative
Intel,Same here. Anything above 25.9.2 crashes ray tracing games like Silent Hill  2 and Oblivion Remastered.   Ihr never had a more crash prone GPU than the 9070XT.,Negative

Intel,5070ti fs  basically a better 9070xt,Positive
Intel,"I’d wait on 5080ti with more VRAM but these are going to be obscenely expensive knowing nvidia + current RAM prices. Both 5070ti or 5080 are more of a sidegrade than upgrade, not worth the hassle IMO.",Negative
Intel,Get a 5070ti. I never thought I would say that. But this is what is is.. 9 months after release and the drivers are still D.S.,Neutral
Intel,What about a secondhand 5070ti?,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, I wouldn't get either. 5070 TI is a sidegrade from the XTX, and 5080 is only slightly better. DLSS and RT would be the only reason.",Neutral
Intel,Sidegrading for an upscaler sounds like a joke.,Neutral
Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux. However, thanks to Develer’s work on VKD3D-Proton 3.0, there is partial and unofficial support for RDNA 3 under specific conditions.  RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral
Intel,This has been announced for months.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah AMD refusing to port features to any card released before the 9 series makes supporting them really hard.,Negative
Intel,Say thanks they haven't demoted 7000 series to only game drivers,Neutral
Intel,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive
Intel,"Its because RDNA 4 added hardware that 3 and 2 don't have. Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced. Perhaps there will be enough noise to get AMD to change their mind or it might be that they want to get it out on their latest cards first before complicating matters with older RDNA support.  Only time will tell",Neutral

Intel,"If it's any consolation, I was on an NVidia card for 2+ years where I wasn't getting the DLSS updates. Then they actively removed features when they went to the NVIDIA app.  Looking at AMD's roadmap, RDNA4 looks like a stopgap anyway until RDNA5 (prob will be called UDNA?) comes out.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,"Most of the conversations happened across various discord servers, so I cannot directly link them, but I also found a few posts here on reddit that seem to point towards the same direction which roughly match with the timeframe.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct\_mode\_not\_working/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/1nl0540/direct_mode_not_working/)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr\_crashing\_on\_amd\_drivers\_after\_2451\_direct/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1ljezuf/steamvr_crashing_on_amd_drivers_after_2451_direct/)  It's a bit odd because if you set the flag beforehand with a older version and then update to newer versions, Directmode still works fine, but if you fully remove the drivers with AMD's driver removal utility or Display Driver uninstaller (which propably deletes some cached driver file for directmode, is my guess), Directmode disables fully and can't turn on anymore at all.      As far as headsets are concerned, I know at least Valve's implementation seems to suffer from this (I know about cases involving the Valve Index, Bigscreen Beyond and Vive Pro 1, all using Valve's implementation), but somebody in the pimax subreddit community discord seemed to have the same problem, which he also was only able to fix by rolling back the drivers.  I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.  But I do think that it is a fairly reproducable problem, at least on my end, it happened across two different systems.",Neutral
Intel,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",Neutral

Intel,I can confirm there is no issue in linux. A windows version running under proton in linux has no issues as well.   In the video there is flickering on head and body. I see only flickering on the head (when running it on the windows pc)  But my body has no layers attached - the body in the video usually comes with layers.

With details open, you can hit tab a few more times to cycle back to the process list elements. if you start typing 'RadeonSoftware.exe' (should just need to key in ""rad""), it'll pull that process element into view.

Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Neutral

Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Neutral
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .

Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral

Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Negative

Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Negative
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral
Intel,"On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",Neutral
Intel,I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.,Neutral
Intel,Could just be a cache issue,Neutral
Intel,Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.,Positive
Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral
Intel,"The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",Neutral
Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative
Intel,"Intel uses software translation for DX11 and lower, so it does matter for them.",Neutral
Intel,"Hmm, Nvidia lost less performance going from 14900k to 13600k than AMD but more when going down to 12100",Neutral
Intel,"> No, they do not. The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software. They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  This was true for Alchemist but not for Battlemage.",Negative
Intel,That's not true. Intel's issue is being too verbose in commands/calls.,Negative
Intel,"Never, because HUB doesn't like portraying Nvidia in any light besides negative.",Negative
Intel,HUB used DX12 games that also showed the issue.  It's something else.,Neutral
Intel,"The comment to which I am replying is talking about nVidia, not Intel.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m pretty sure HUB doesn’t like Nvidia *or* AMD. They’re calling it how it is, these parts are too damn expensive.",Negative
Intel,That's actually... just worse news.,Negative
Intel,I always dreamt of the day APUs become power houses.,Neutral
Intel,"Is it my expectations being too high or this ain't a huge uplift? To go back to the classic: hopefully Zen 6 with RDNA 4 will offer a bigger uplift. We only have to wait a year and a half...  Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.  Essentially games will be limited to the 5.1ghz peak 4 core zen5 core cluster or the 3.3ghz peak 8 core zen5c core cluster.",Negative
Intel,Damn Why is AMD even involved in iGPU,Negative
Intel,"If this is true, Strix Point is going to claim total dominance over the GTX 1650 market. Won't be until 2023 when the theoretical RTX 4050 is released to surpass Strix Point's efficiency. Then super budget-friendly Strix Halo will come next year and take the RTX 2080's lunch money. Game over Nvidia.",Neutral
Intel,"Strix Halo is rumored to be a whopping 40 CUs of RDNA3.5 so...   That'll do it no sweat, if they release it.",Neutral
Intel,almost there,Neutral
Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Neutral
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative
Intel,yes its so bad. better go buy some steam deck or ally x,Negative
Intel,Low-quality trolling and shitposting. Spamming this same meme at different threads now.,Neutral
Intel,"If they put it in the next Razer Blade / Asus G16 laptop, I will instantly buy it.",Neutral
Intel,How are they going to feed all those CUs? Quad-channel LPDDR5X?,Neutral
Intel,That's considerably faster than an XSX.,Positive
Intel,>That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.  What is?,Neutral
Intel,"```That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.```   The PS5 Pro will land around there, but the current consoles are like 6700 ~ 6700 XT tier.",Neutral
Intel,"Your idea sounds good, been thinking about it myself, but the price is what determines its value.",Positive

Intel,Did the other reviews you looked at compare with a 780m with 7500 ram or have multiple 890m devices for comparison though?,Neutral
Intel,"bandwidth is mostly determined by the amount of channels, not whether the memory modules are in the same package or not",Neutral
Intel,"How is 40-60% performance uplift at half the power underwhelming? If anything it is the CPU performance and the usefulness of the NPU, which are the underwhelming parts of this package...",Negative

Intel,7500mhz ram and the 780m,Neutral
Intel,"if you don't consider power, sure, but in that case you may as well go discrete. efficiency is a big reason for these AIO packages and on-package memory can prevent breaking the power budget while pushing higher bandwidth.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed. Also the closer the memory is to the CPU, the higher the speeds, thus bandwidth. On-package memory will always be faster.",Neutral
Intel,"Have _you_ looked at the actual game benchmarks in the review? The Ally X (a low power handheld) is within 1fps of the bottom of the 890m laptops. It's 5-9fps to the very fastest (again a higher power laptop!!), all at 1080p high settings which i think should  be the target for this range of entries in the roundup.  There is nothing like a 40-60% uplift in those games and that very standard resolution? I was stoked for Strix Point myself but this is super underwhelming.",Neutral

Intel,> 40-60% performance uplift at half the power  Source?,Neutral
Intel,"i chuckled, then again im not a fanboy of anything",Neutral
Intel,Dont expect 40CUs in a handheld anytime soon,Negative
Intel,"Based on the results, it seems like the next steam deck might be more than a year away. Not particularly impressive gains from the previous gen.",Negative
Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

Intel,">AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs  AMD doesn't need to make ""Monster"" class APUs as they cater to the x86 desktop market where they make ""Monster"" dGPUs which can be upgraded independently.   And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral
Intel,"Installs beta software, proceeds to complain about it",Neutral
Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround.

Intel,"I get that you are being cheeky, but the use-case is very difference and the professional-demands are far far far higher.  When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  I'm not the guy you're replying to, but for me, almost never.  I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.

Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
Intel,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.   That said, I have no idea how close the iGPU is to being bandwidth bottlenecked at 1080p. But I very much doubt doubling it would also double the frame rate.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I think Intel has done a great job with the improvements, I just don't want to overhype things.",Positive
Intel,"I wonder if Valve would be considering Panther Lake for a Steam Deck 2. It sounds like a generational leap from RDNA2 (which is what they were looking for), and can be cheap enough for valve to slightly subsidize the cost.   I guess the main thing is the power envelope. I think Valve is only interested in making handhelds that deal with a 15W TDP or lower",Neutral
Intel,"the handhelds with these chips are going to slap. Also people gotta remember that using upscaling on smaller screens especially 7-9 inch screens is a lot more tolerable.  and these benchmarks are of triple A titles, monster hunter wilds is a dogshit unoptimized game, and people will be playing a mixture of game from older titles, indies, emulation etc.",Neutral
Intel,"Series 3 seems like the biggest Intel W in a long while.   Plays AAA games at 45-60fps with upscaling, and all other games at native at 60+. Not to mention this is 50% faster than AMD's equivalent HX370 while being massively more power efficient.   There's also already laptops listed on sites like Best Buy for reasonable prices (sub $1300). Compare this to the AI 395 from AMD that can't be found for less than $2500 while being significantly less power efficient. Granted, that APU isn't really comparable.",Positive
Intel,"So remind me, the ARC B390 is not a discrete GPU?  although the ARC B580, and B570 are discrete GPUs?  and the ARC A380 is a discrete GPU?",Neutral

Intel,AMD should have made a RDNA4 igpu... RDNA5 igpu is gonna be a huge boost.,Positive
Intel,"In a year or two,when they can get panther lake for cheap, this could be resolved. They could even get more efficiency with a refined 18a for the CPU and whatever node is available for the GPU. With the current RAM prices I wouldn’t expect any major console style updates until 2027 anyways",Neutral
Intel,Do you think there's any particular reason why they would want to go with ARM? Quite sure Intel proved here that efficiency is essentially equal between both ARM and x86 here,Neutral
Intel,It's hilarious to think Steam would work with Qualcomm.,Neutral
Intel,"Very unlikely. Proton and DXVK work alright with x86 but adding ARM conversion on top is, uh, a **very** poor experience. In fact that first generation of Snapdragon laptops had among the highest return rate of laptops I have ever seen. Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances. Anything that can increase incompatibility rate (and it VERY well can, ARM **does not** support AVX2 natively for instance meaning [a lot of games that might have issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1dekmtz/avx2_game_list/) even starting or underperform).",Negative

Intel,why didn't they do one? Why use tech that is so old?,Negative
Intel,"Even more efficiency that doesn't exist yet. Snapdragon elite can do some heavy workloads for several hours at a time, but it's not powerful enough for heavy gaming. Valve says they know what they want, it's just not ready yet. I think as great as Panther Lake benchmarks are, the biggest complaint of the Steam Deck is still the 2ish hours of battery life in more demanding titles.  With the existence of other handhelds already, I don't think Valve is trying to aim for the beefier spec department here, if it means the same battery life.",Negative
Intel,"I'm not sure if this is sarcastic or if you missed the memo, but their new VR headset coming later this year is powered by a Snapdragon 8 gen 3.  [https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe)  A Qualcomm based steam deck isn't out of the question.",Neutral
Intel,"Valve's stand-alone VR headset uses Snapdragon, and x86 emulation, so will be interesting to see how well it performs",Positive
Intel,"It depends. For a PC, yes. For a handheld, I don't think so. For the future of enterprise notebooks, probably, especially since Apple has been doing it for a while.",Neutral
Intel,Save cost. AMD's assessment is that no one in mobile cares about gaming and if they do they should just get Strix Halo or build a PC.   cheapskate AMD as always.,Negative
Intel,"probably didn't want to bother redesigning the APU without also having a CPU upgrade, it's expensive after all, and takes resources from other projects",Negative
Intel,"""Even more efficiency that doesn't exist yet.""??????????????",Negative
Intel,"But Qualcomm drivers on Linux are even worse than Intel lol. The custom AMD APU on the Steam Deck had the advantage of great Linux driver support for gaming(not just being able to support the GPU hardware and benchmarks, but run games at good performance which Intel still can't match). No other company has both high performance GPU and good Linux graphics drivers",Negative
Intel,isn't the APU a modular unit where they could just put the new one into the same die space?,Neutral
Intel,"Not my words. I'm taking Valve's. They said they know what they want, and if it was Panther Lake, we'd know already.",Neutral
Intel,"The Strix Halo is that basically, but the normal Strix Point APUs (e.g. HX 370) are not. The Strix Halo follow-up, Medusa Halo, is slated for 2027, and to use Zen 6 and RDNA5. While the Strix Halo could benefit from FSR4 if it got an RDNA4 update, it's still way stronger than the B390, even at similar power.",Neutral

Intel,"I'm looking forward to this, especially for a gaming handheld/mini pc device, having a gpu that is nearly capable of a RTX 4050 with that power profile could be game changing.  Plus all the existing Intel XESS features are icing on the cake, although support for that scaler is flakey. I'm just hopeful that more games will support XESS.",Positive

Intel,Waiting for this since AMD 890M was disappointing,Negative
Intel,"Who cares, gives cheaper powerful GPUs for 2k, 4k gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, RDNA 3.5 lasted way too long. Admittedly, RDNA4 was a special case where they gave up on a mobile version in favour of getting UDNA ready but that's their own fault. Hopefully, this pushes them to make UDNA a mobile focused architecture as well and perhaps push more cores in igpus to take back the integrated graphics crown. Competition is very good for the consumer.",Negative
Intel,agreed. these rehashed mobile chips with bad upscaling are well beyond their lifespan.,Negative
Intel,"I looked at the benchmark scores they put out and it looks pretty promising, apparently the 12XE core variant can score somewhere around 6300 on Time Spy graphics (https://www.notebookcheck.net/Early-Intel-Panther-Lake-iGPU-benchmark-impresses-with-50-faster-performance-vs-Lunar-Lake.1138923.0.html).  Intel is comparing a 4050 with low wattage (60W system TDP IIRC) so it's not as good as the full powered 4050 which scores around 8000 on Time Spy. On low powered 4050s though like the one in the XPS and other thin and lights it will compare pretty evenly. It also outscores basically any 3050 on the market since the highest powered ones get around 4500-5000 on Time Spy (which was already matched pretty decently by the old 8XE core GPUs)",Positive

Intel,"That's a bit of a different case, because they are designing a new product either way they might as well look into supporting something like LPCAMM2. They already have a mainboard for the FW13 that can support these newer CPUs, so there has to be a very compelling reason to spend money to redesign that, which I think a single Intel SKU is not unfortunately.",Neutral
Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.  But you won't see DDR5 SO-DIMM designs - if they claim to be DDR5 SO-DIMM and Arc B390 then its wrong.",Neutral

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,"Late to this, but I'm a 13900K owner. I have not had any issues with stability since applying the BIOS update and haven't noticed any performance loss, so I think this is fine. I did not thoroughly benchmark before and after though, partially because of how high peak temperatures were before the update. I am using a Noctua NH-D15 and a contact frame to reduce CPU temperatures.  Up until a few days ago I would have said that thread scheduling isn't an issue, but then I played the game Maneater and it's basically unplayable unless you use launch options to force the game to only P-cores. There's the Intel ""Application Optimizer (APO)"" utility but it seems abandoned and you can't add your own games if Intel hasn't added a profile. I was a big proponent of E-cores but honestly it seems like a half-baked technology that Intel never put the effort in to support properly.

AMD,"Let's see if tech media applies the same level of scrutiny now that AMD has failing cpus. Also, the new 9850x3d could be a new stepping to mitigate whatever this is.",Neutral
AMD,"ASRock, GigaByte and ASUS having problems with these chips. I think it's time for AMD to issue a recall.",Negative
AMD,"It isn’t just 9800x3d  I had 2 asus b850 e rog boards that once you updated bios it over volted the 9700x and killed it.  2 boards, 2 9700x, swapped to msi x870e edge to and zero problems.",Neutral
AMD,So all my efforts in buying a Gigabyte Motherboard specifically to avoid this problem were for naught?,Negative
AMD,I am sooooo fucking glad I ditched Asus after 20+ years and went with my first MSI mobo for my 9800X3D build a few months ago,Positive
AMD,Impossible. I've been assured it's only an Asrock issue.,Negative
AMD,Why am I not surprised it's aSus again,Neutral
AMD,Instability I understand but can undervolting destroy a chip?,Neutral
AMD,"I had 5700X3D and it died after 9 months of usage, on Gigabyte motherboard.",Negative
AMD,"Could be something with the chips too. My 7800X3D died recently, after 2 years in an MSI board. Was already acting wonky for a few months with a few failed boots and all sorts of issues waking up from sleep.",Negative
AMD,"> To be safe, don’t use sleep mode, just shut down.  This is an extremely cucked way to operate a computer. Semi-custom server parts or engineering samples would be one thing, but on a production chip the power saving features are expected to *work*.",Negative
AMD,I have seen other suggestions that sleep mode is involved.,Neutral
AMD,"This also raises a slight possibility that the failure mode can be blamed on some windows 11 fuckup, and we all know such a thing is entirely plausible.",Negative
AMD,"I’m on the Pro Art motherboard and on a older bios, wondering if I should just leave it as it is",Neutral
AMD,"I have a 9950X3D on the X870e-e R2, have you heard if these issues are present on the R2 version of the board at all? I can't seem to find any reason why they even made a new revision.",Negative
AMD,"What do you mean, don’t undervolt? Aren’t the best guesses for why the 9800X3Ds dying that the VSoC was too high (1.3V or more)?",Neutral
AMD,"ASRock has been pretty open about reaching out to AMD, it's just they haven't been receiving any word back. The fact ASUS is involved now, is finally pushing AMD to (hopefully) do something.",Neutral
AMD,Indeed. I am nervous about my Tuf Gaming B650 Plus Wifi potentially frying my new 9800x3d...,Neutral
AMD,"ASRock is taking long because they don't know and can't find the cause. Gamers' Nexus and Wendell from Level 1 Techs are both looking at it as well, more emphasis on Wendell. They can't find anything solid. They can't even reproduce the issue with motherboards that have had CPUs die in them already.",Negative
AMD,"It's Karma, stop kicking puppies!",Negative
AMD,"I updated the BIOS on my MSI board due to memory instability issues, but now there’s another problem with cold boot stutters. I wonder if AORUS/Gigabyte is doing better.  At least ASUS is acknowledging the issue unlike MSI.",Negative
AMD,Friend of mine just updated his BIOS on a Gigabyte x870 which didn't post afterwards. Thought his was another victim of this issue but luckily he was able to do a BIOS recovery and then was able to flash the newest BIOS afterwards. Super strange series of events there and he is a computer guy so I'm sure he didn't grab the wrong file or something dumb.,Neutral
AMD,"It all depends on numbers.  The Intel issues were big enough that they were noticed by multiple independent third parties, and pretty quickly after release.  And the target reliability can never be 100% perfection, 0.1% of a large number sold can still be a large number of cases.  This is why I'd love people to actually publish numbers, so we can really get an idea of the *real* chances of things going wrong, and not just a collection of anecdotes that may be amplified or ignored depending on the media cycle at the time.",Negative
AMD,Same level of scrutiny as what?,Neutral
AMD,Source on the gigabyte? My search didnt yield anything substantial. Only asus and asrock are dying in bulk. In which asrock bios 3.25 or newer is recommended. Mindfactory rma rate for 9800x3d is close to 0.5% which isnt close to a full recall and nominal.  But my take is that just SoC overvoltage madness that also killed intel chips (which was substantially worse from crash report data)  Edit: found one x870 gigabyte board dead. And in the comments 4 asus motherboards who was RMA'd and bios updated.,Negative
AMD,>I think it's time for AMD to issue a recall.  How many are faulty vs how many have been sold?,Neutral
AMD,"MSI isn’t immune either. My X870 MSI board started having issues with cold boot stutters after a BIOS update, and a lot of people are experiencing the same problem while MSI is ignoring it.",Negative
AMD,It’s AMD lol,Neutral
AMD,"It's possible.  If you run a power-limit-saturating workload with an undervolt, the chip is drawing more current than it does at stock. [Current density drives electromigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromigration#Electromigration_reliability_of_a_wire_(Black's_equation\))",Neutral
AMD,"Yeh highly highly unlikely, less voltage and lower temps really ain't gonna hurt a CPU.  So if you use PBO and a negative voltage curve offset like most people who know what they are doing will, I was be shocked if it caused ant issues outside of stability of you push it too far.  I run -40 negative curve offset on my 9800x3d and it sits at 55c in games non stop and 5.4ghz all day",Negative
AMD,"Even with undervolting, you will still get voltage spikes depending on the workload. And there could be something in the CPU that was very sensitive to them.  Also, when undervolting via negative voltage curve on AMD CPUs, they will hit their max rated clock rates more frequently due to having more thermal/power headroom from the undervolting. Then using PBO raises the max allowed clock rate, which at that point changes the CPU's electrical circuit behaviors from beyond the stock setting.  Now if the CPUs are still dying at stock settings, then something went terribly wrong for AMD.",Neutral
AMD,"I had one die too.  I got lucky though, AMD replaced it with a 5800X3D.  Hope that doesn’t die now.",Negative
AMD,"Many motherboards have had issues with sleep and wake modes for as long as I can remember going back to the early 2010s and they still do today.  I remember dealing with sleep mode issues on my Sandy Bridge PC back in 2011 and all the way up to current gen it’s still been wonky for some reason. My current MSI motherboard has issues with randomly stuttering on cold boot, and MSI doesn’t even acknowledge or say anything about the issue.",Negative
AMD,"Wait by ""Sleep Mode"" is that just putting the PC to sleep/suspend thru the OS?",Neutral
AMD,Nope. It doesn't matter if you undervolt or put a higher voltage.,Neutral
AMD,I had VSoC set to 1.2. Just hard set it to 1.2 then disable PBO and dont use Curve Optimizer/Shaper - it's really not worth it.,Negative
AMD,fr it's like everyone hda to team up to get AMD's attention. let's hope for some quick updates now,Neutral
AMD,Isn't ASUS a major shareholder in AsRock and share many components?,Neutral
AMD,"> Our teams are conducting preventive checks on product compatibility and performance, working closely with AMD to validate reported cases and ensure ongoing stability and quality.  ...means ""they haven't been receiving any word back."" to you? /r/hardware really grasps at any straw to trash AMD.",Neutral
AMD,"It's got a decent warranty, no?",Neutral
AMD,Are the 600 series board affected? I got the ASUS X670E last year; pretty happy with it.,Positive
AMD,"Intel 13th/14th gen issues hit volume customers, and that's why it gained traction - it had very little to do with the average consumer PC builder's experience, other than it mimicked the kinds of experiences larger datacenter operators and OEMs experienced in their own operations.  Unless the AMD issues rise to that level of impact for any extended period of time, it will likely stay quiet.",Neutral
AMD,Likely intel's microcode killing 13th and 14th gen. It's popular in here to drag 'techtubers' because they say mean things about the mega corps.,Neutral
AMD,"It’s always been the PBO defaults IMHO. Also, the x3d boost crap as well.  The cache makes everything more sensitive to issues obviously. Happy with my b650 choice over the 850 and the offset/undervolt.",Negative
AMD,"Literally thousands 9800x3d CPUs died on Gigabyte boards, same as AsRock, Asus or MSI.",Neutral
AMD,Guess we just die then,Neutral
AMD,and it was intel not too long ago also.... its almost like they are pre overclocking all the CPU with a boosts and increase voltages to hit peak clock speeds and win benchmarks in the consumer space.  We dont hear about this from either vendor in the server space as they are much more conservative in that regard as stability is #1 priority.  Sadly I think its going to become the new norm.,Negative
AMD,"I hope it isn't AMD because I would be really fucking pissed if I'm sitting on a $3,000 time bomb with an arbitrary fuse.",Negative
AMD,"The undervolting on amd is pretty insignificant, -30millivolt is less than 3%, i highly doubt that would produce significant increases in electromigration",Negative
AMD,"Ah, thx.",Neutral
AMD,lmao if someone in this thread scores a free 9850X3D if it goes belly up on them.,Negative
AMD,"Oh, I do not doubt that poor testing and underinvestment in firmware are common, but that doesn't excuse it. A $250 motherboard shouldn't have stupid firmware bugs that cost the user an extra $25/year in electricity (in cheap places...) or alternately several minutes a day recreating context.",Negative
AMD,"Exactly. The issue stems beyond the motherboard manufactures, whether the issue lies within a flaw of the chip or in the AGESA coding for the BIOS.   Edit: Downvote all you want, the issue is on AMDs side when the BIOS updates clearly aren't doing anything to stop the chips from dying.",Negative
AMD,Isn't this stuff the reason they're releasing the 9850x3d?  With the 7800x3d we didn't need a year plus of bios updates or a 7850x3d to fix it since it was genuinely board vendors over-juicing their boards.,Negative
AMD,"Not since 2007/2008. ASRock was spun off from ASUS around that time period, and became their own company. Both operate under their parent (Pegatron) but are independent from one another.",Neutral
AMD,What does ASUS PR statement have to do with ASRock?,Neutral
AMD,"If you go back and read my first comment, I was talking about ASRock being upfront about reaching out to AMD and not hearing anything back. All you did was quote an *ASUS* comment from the article, which doesn't pertain to ASRock.   So let me get this straight....ASRock, ASUS, MSI, and Gigabyte (few posts but nothing too substantial) are all experiencing issues with the 9000 series CPUs dying right? AMD was blaming motherboard manufactures over the Summer, and each one has released several BIOS revisions that...guess what? Aren't stopping the chips from dying.   Are you going to really sit here, and throw out the excuse that ""Ohhhh r/hardware is just trying to find any reason to blame AMD and throw trash at them!!!"". The fact of the matter is, the motherboard manufacturers don't know what the issue is. So clearly the issue definitely falls on AMD, because nobody knows what the hell is happening.",Negative
AMD,"Reading comprehension is an essential skill for becoming a functional adult and joining the workforce. You will struggle significantly in your professional life if this is how you respond on impulse.   I highly encourage you to read books, then think about what you read, write a report for yourself, and then read more books.",Neutral
AMD,https://youtu.be/jiEv6VTDt5c?feature=shared  Start here buddy.,Neutral
AMD,"I'd prefer not to actually test how the Asus e-store where i bought my motherboard and Amazon where i bought my CPU, would coordinate liability in case both pieces of hardware get fried.",Negative
AMD,"Also it manifested in game servers (where single-threaded performance was needed).  The real issue was that Intel issue would slowly manifest. Going from occasional software bugs/crashes (often initially reported as GPU driver crashes, which Nvidia quickly blamed Intel) and then increasingly becoming unstable. I read about one game developer who got a flood of crash reports from one user, and when they told the user that their CPU was dying, the user demanded a refund and posted a negative review accusing the game of being poorly programmed.",Negative
AMD,"What are the PBO offsets, if you know? I’m on MSI which don’t seem to be having as many problems (and a 7800X3D), but I’m trying to be extra cautious lol.",Neutral
AMD,"Thousands? Got any reporting for that? Because that sounds like an incredibly large number.  But also, the kind of number someone would just throw out there.",Negative
AMD,Do you have a source for the thousands?  I've seen a bunch myself but wasn't aware of that many.,Neutral
AMD,Only way to run CPU’s safely is the tried and tested method of static Vcore with a droopy LLC. Any other method clearly isn’t safe,Neutral
AMD,"They're still a major shareholder, like they said.",Neutral
AMD,I meant like yes they were spun off but still are quite related. Hell sometimes their boards have very similar defects.,Negative
AMD,Asus owns Pegatron which owns ASRock.,Neutral
AMD,Obviously but it's not like you're stuck with a dead cpu if it's a problematic unit,Negative
AMD,Haha. That's why I used overclockers for all my purchases LOL.  3-year warranty!,Positive
AMD,"MSI have the same issues like any other board maker, it's just not as popular in US and A so you have to find informations about it's issues outside reddit or twitter.",Negative
AMD,"Nope. It literally does not matter, your CPU can die on stock settings.",Negative
AMD,"That hasn't been true since 2009, when ASUS sold off its last shares of Pegatron. They are not a shareholder.",Negative
AMD,"Their relation ends at the parent company, otherwise, that's pretty much it. Which defects are you referring to, outside of the current ongoing problem?  Edit: ASUS sold off its stake in Pegatron (finalized in 2012), which means they are not a major shareholder.  [Asianometry](https://www.asianometry.com/p/asus-explained-a-rare-taiwanese-global) did a mini doc/article back in 2021 going over ASUS(tek)/Pegatron separation/spin-off.

AMD,"No longer true, ASUS sold their stake in Pegatron in 2009. They don't have a stake in ownership of ASRock.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah?? I’m saying static Vcore with a droopy LLC is the only safe way to run CPU’s,Neutral
AMD,"That’s like saying “they are brother and sister… their relation ends at their parents, that’s pretty much it”.  You don’t get much more related as 2 companies than having the same parent company.",Neutral
AMD,Nope. Doesn't matter at all.,Neutral

AMD,Nope.,Neutral
AMD,Imagine being this thick.,Negative
AMD,Standard mid-cycle MSRP reset.,Neutral
AMD,"From what I can see the cheapest 9800X3D right now online (no Microcenter deals) is $469. 6-7% price increase is fine I guess for a rumoured 7%-10% perf jump (usually value decreases for more expensive parts). Then again, I'm sure that the 9800X3D price will drop when this launches, which is welcome I guess. Maybe $400 9800X3Ds? Though that will make the 9850X3D basically DOA.   Checked, and it's at $449 in the Philippines but I guess that's more on our currency dropping in value and stores not updating prices yet lmao.",Neutral
AMD,6-7% price jump for even 5% performance would still be well under the usual premium charged for Halo products. I'm ok with it.,Positive
AMD,"Might as well throw out this old R7 7800X3D, there's an entire 10 extra Minecraft FPS out there for the taking now!",Neutral
AMD,What is the likelihood that Nova Lake equals or surpasses the 9850?,Neutral

AMD,So I’m not sad that I spend 260€ two weeks ago for a 7800x3d.,Negative
AMD,I am skeptical that would actually be the price on shelves,Neutral
AMD,"It seems that memory performance has improved, but since Infinity Fabric has not kept up, it's actually just an improvement in CPU clock speed. $499 is reasonable.",Negative
AMD,Anyone preorder on Amazon? If so what was your delivery date?,Neutral
AMD,Might get this and check how well it does in the CPU limited scenarios that I have used for testing 14900KS vs 9800X3D.    9800X3D saw good gains with just RAM tuning and I believe 9850X3D will do better.,Positive
AMD,"I kinda did a stupid, got a 870e-e strix relatively cheap and now im waiting for this to hit stores. Hoping my xmp 6400 ram will work without much hastle",Negative
AMD,"That's cheaper than I expected.   I already have a 9800X3D though, so I'm waiting to see if Zen 6 will be worth upgrading to. The rumor mill says they will have +50% cores, so the 10800X3D will have 12 cores and 24 threads, that is going to be upgrade worthy for sure if the price is somewhat similar to current gen.",Neutral
AMD,Gonna ride out my 7800X3D till AM6 comes out.,Neutral
AMD,Rip-off. Better wait for Zen 6 or just get 9800x3D,Neutral
AMD,bro i just bought a 9800x3d................!!!,Neutral
AMD,Hmm. Not good. Price of 9800X3D will still be $450 then.,Negative
AMD,Why is that guy smiling? It is not about the price.,Negative
AMD,What about the 9800X3Ds dying?,Neutral
AMD,"What is the actual difference between a 9800X3D and a 9850X3D? What is the purpose of this product?  Better to wait for the ""11800X3D"" or whatever it'll end up being called.",Neutral
AMD,Wasn't this CPU already out?  A step above the 9800X3D?,Neutral
AMD,"Really wonder if I should upgrade my 3 month old 9800X3D while these ""exist"" before Ai shitshow makes them impossible to find and probably delays the Zen6 into 2027",Negative
AMD,The people who would consider upgrading are priced out of DDR5 so this CPU is DOA.,Neutral
AMD,There is zero chance this thing is anywhere NEAR 10% faster unless AMD is putting like twice the power through it.,Negative
AMD,think 3%,Neutral
AMD,It's a \~3% gaming performance improvement even by AMD's own slides.  Productivity might be closer to 7% but that's about the theoretical max what you'd see.,Positive
AMD,>Maybe $400 9800X3Ds? Though that will make the 9850X3D basically DOA.  Products like this are never DOA if they are the best thing available. Plenty of people bought 12/13/14900KS's even though it was the same thing with slightly better binning/clock speeds.,Neutral
AMD,dude 400mhz boost (200 if you count pbo) is not going to be in the same universe with 7-10% perf jump LOL,Neutral
AMD,"No it won't, it was reported this replaces the 9800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"Yea, I thought there was no way they'd do 499 -  I mean for one, it's AMD, but a product like this, like a KS, normally has a stupid premium attached.  I'm surprised at anything below 549.",Negative
AMD,30->40 great  290->300 meh,Positive
AMD,"Same, I'll probably ride my 7800X3D until Zen 7 releases ( apparently still on AM5 if the rumors are true ), then I'll probably grab a CPU in the X3D Zen 7 lineup and ride that until AM7.",Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake will basically be a full node advantage.  So in power efficiency, certainty.  In productivity, almost a certainty. You have to go to 9950 to be competitive against the 285HX (although that's on N3B)  In gaming performance, it depends, esp. on how much cache they're going to put on and how much latency their design has.  In terms of price/performance, depends on their yields.",Positive
AMD,"unless Intel has an alternative for 3d cache, it's not happening lol",Neutral
AMD,Did you preorder? Mine says delivery 2/6-2/13. Wondering if others who preordered before me show 1/29,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah depending on your GPU and resolution, and the games you play, you probably get 95% of the gaming performance in real world FPS of the 9850X3D for half the price.  That's money well spent.",Positive
AMD,Well the expensive thing will be DDR5 so the price of this is irrelevant.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think there will be much demand, it’s basically just a replacement/refresh of the 9800X3D and most people that wanted one of those already have one.",Neutral
AMD,Amazon drop their stock today and still in stock. That is the price. Delivery date February 1st.,Neutral
AMD,Someone must be new to marketing,Neutral
AMD,AMD’s product cycle for Zen has been pretty consistent at around 18 months. This is confirmation Zen 6 is going to be a little delayed compared to the usual cycle.,Neutral
AMD,"The purpose is that improvements in binning have allowed a clockspeed to only be achieved by a % of 9800X3D's when overclocked can now be achieved by most, so it'll be relaunched with that new clockspeed.  This gives a ""new"" product from AMD to have for the press cycle to cover because we're still several quarters away from Zen 6 (it's no coincidence review embargo for 9850X3D comes the day after PTL's)  It'll also reset ASPs on this product up by $20 without ""raising"" prices",Neutral
AMD,It serves the same purpose as what Intel's i9-KS products did.,Neutral
AMD,> What is the purpose of this product?  Make money,Neutral
AMD,The biggest mistake someone can make is waiting for next generation.,Neutral
AMD,All the “tests” of it were just people overclocking 9800X3Ds to match the new speed of this,Neutral
AMD,Are you thinking of the 9**9**50x3D?,Neutral
AMD,sounds like a waste of money to me,Negative
AMD,"imo, the only way that would make sense is if you could use your old cpu in another system.",Neutral
AMD,"The only one that might be worth it is the 9950X3D2 when it comes out, with dual CCD. But even then youre pretty far into niche territory. Youd have to be hitting your CPU pretty hard to max out the 3D V-cache and need a 2nd one.",Neutral
AMD,"Why do you wonder that? Of course you shouldn't. It's not even worth the effort it would take to physically swap the CPU out, let alone the money that will be wasted.",Negative
AMD,People who will spend $500 on a CPU are absolutely not 'priced out' because of memory. :/,Negative
AMD,So people who are already on AM5 but not using X3D yet don't exist?,Neutral
AMD,"I am on 7700X and happy, but I might upgrade to this chip one day",Positive
AMD,"It wont be 10%, PC's scale more or less pretty linear with performance under normal conditions, a jump from 5.2Ghz all core to 5.6Ghz is a difference of 7-8% at most and that ofc only goes if the CPU is the bottleneck.",Neutral
AMD,productivity is the only reason you would get this CPU in the first place.,Neutral
AMD,"12900K is a different chip (less cache, less E-cores, won't destroy itself, etc.). 13900K/14900K/KS/etc. are the same chip with different binning.",Neutral
AMD,"400 with PBO still, you can PBO both chips.",Neutral
AMD,"It's hard to imagine it won't, but that is still rumor.  2-4% gaming improvement and 5-7% productivity improvement isn't exactly a product segmentation step.",Negative
AMD,8.3 ms vs 0.1 ms reduction in input lag,Neutral
AMD,"Same boat. The 78x3D doesn't get the same praise as the 58x3d, but it's a considerable bump in performance and it uses so little power.   I will run this until whatever the last gen x3d on AM5 is, then probably be able to run that for 3-5 more years.",Neutral
AMD,"I believe they were talking about gaming performance specifically. Since you don't compare 1 SKU to an entire generation like Nova Lake.   But by the time Nova Lake releases, Zen 6 comes under contention as well.",Neutral
AMD,Do you mean 285K? Because from the reports I've seen that's what the 9950x competes with. The 9900x for 265k and such.,Neutral
AMD,"I think Nova Lake is supposed to have an equivalent, bLLC or something like that.",Neutral
AMD,"Nova Lake is supposed to have a large cache variant, although it is not 3D stacked, so the latency advantage of 3D stacking remains to be seen.",Neutral
AMD,Last rumors has Nova-Lake with 144-288 MB of bLLC depending on the model.,Neutral
AMD,"I just want to know if I should wait for Nova Lake or get a 9850. For gaming, ofc",Neutral
AMD,"Just put 5 times as much DDR1 then, lmao",Neutral
AMD,Zen 6 x3D just needs a 32 GB cache.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, the only real market I see for this (other than people strongly affected by FOMO who need the absolute best of the best for their system and upgrade every single time a new part comes out) are people who are just building a new system from scratch and do want the best of the best. And I don't think many people are keen on building with this current market.",Negative
AMD,"Maybe, maybe not. Zen 4 and 5 haven't stopped the seemingly endless Zen 3 releases.",Neutral
AMD,"No? Where did this myth come from, anyway? The idea of constantly waiting for whatever someone thinks the ""next gen"" is, that doesn't make any sense.  I have a 9600X now. A 9800X3D isn't that great when I know that a perfectly good upgrade is coming relatively soon. Zen 6 will also likely be the last gen on AM5, so it's not likely to get better than this. Unless society simply implodes within 2026~2027, we'll be fine.",Negative
AMD,Maybe so.  All the naming is confusing.  Why would they release a 9950 and 9800 but not a 9850?,Negative
AMD,"Nope, I would just sell the 9800x3d for $400",Neutral
AMD,"It's not a matter of how hard you're hitting it, it's the nature of the applications hitting it.

[There are ways to make applications that are able to intelligently allocate their own threads within a given physical CCD](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/evaluating-uniform-memory-access), but as far as I know, the means for that feature set isn't included in AMD consumer chips (there *are* multi-X3D-CCD Epyc CPUs for niche applications). Adding those features to a consumer product would mean AMD undercutting their enterprise products by thousands of dollars per unit.  That's why I'm skeptical of a dual-X3D-CCD consumer part every time it comes up. Even if they do release it, it will have to be aggressively gimped to avoid losing them a ton of money while also being a major disappointment to the people that think they want it. The more likely move would be a 9950X3D with better binned silicon like the 9850X3D is (something akin to AMD's old ""XT"" refresh skews or Intel's ""KS"" models).",Negative
AMD,Says you,Neutral
AMD,You wouldn't get a 9850X3D over a 9900X3D or 9950X3D if productivity is the thing you care about.  The 9850 would be for people who would want to pay a premium to have the marginally fastest gaming CPU.,Neutral
AMD,If you care about productivity then this is not the chip for you.  285K is 69% faster MT | 15% faster ST  9950X3D is 76% faster MT | 7% faster ST  Even 265K and 9900X3D are much better options closer to that price range.,Neutral
AMD,"is this, like, confirmed?",Neutral
AMD,33% increase in frames v.s 3% increase in frames is another good way to understand why the returns diminish the further you go,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, I don't think thats true. The 7800X3D was unanimously the most praised AM5 chip when it came out and its efficiency was a core reason as to why. It's not as glazed relatively speaking because the 5800X3D was just such an anomaly. It offered 7600X performance to users that didn't want to upgrade to AM5, was very power efficient going against the 12900K, was fairly cheap for what you got AND was dropped mid cycle for AM5 when everyone would've thought AM4 was dead + people were complaining about DDR5 pricing when AM5 launched and this was a saviour.  Like, the 5800x3D really caught a perfect storm. And the 7800 did get surpassed a few years later (even if by a fairly small margin) so it loses that Halo effect for people.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, likely X3D Zen 6 will be quite a bit after Nova Lake.  So they might take the crown, but that's the one that they have the least chance at IMO.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, sorry, brain fart. I am so sick of the terrible marketing names.",Negative

AMD,"you need to double the bandwidth for each gen (not exactly so, but a general approximation). So for DDR1 you would need 16 times as much running in 32 channel mode.",Neutral
AMD,"You could also see people who were putting off upgrading from a 7000 series part finally decide to pull the trigger. It's obviously not worth going from the 9800X3D to the 9850X3D, but if you're moving up a generation having a little bump like this can push you over the threshold to buy.",Neutral
AMD,"The Zen 3 parts that are getting released were all manufactured years ago. They just didn't hit requirements, so once enough defective inventory built up, they were released as a new SKU in small numbers",Neutral
AMD,"The 9850X3D is just a better binned 9800X3D.  The step above the 9800X3D is the 9900X3D. You get more threads, but lower boost as it's contained within 120 W TDP.  You get 45% more productivity for 7% lower gaming performance or  90% more productivity for like 2% lower gaming performance.",Neutral
AMD,"Just wait, soon we'll have the 9950X3D2",Neutral
AMD,I’m in the same exact scenario. I think we can get $400 for our 9800 cpu.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean... yes? That is literally correct, I did say that.  That not withstanding, how do you justify spending ~$100 (provided you get ~$400 for your 9800X3D, and ignoring potential selling fees) for maybe 8% more FPS in the best case scenario? Are you even stressing the 9800X3D with your 9070 XT, or would you land at literally the same performance after the swap?",Neutral
AMD,"No, gaming gains here are irrelevant. Productivity gains of 7% can make enough difference to pay for itself. Productivity is the only scenario where this is useful.",Positive
AMD,Nah but id be very surprised if they weren't like all other Zen 5 chips are able to do.,Neutral
AMD,"Even then, going from 290 FPS to 386 FPS (33% increase) is a much less noticeable change than going from 30 to 40 because it's still a much lower decrease in input lag.",Neutral
AMD,"Makes sense. The 78x3d was certainly very well received. It got buy recommendations from reviewers and it was the top of the line during it's run. I got mine at the low point in it's price history for ~$300, which was a steal imo. I can't imagine anyone with this cpu will feel the need to upgrade (for gaming) for a long time.

AMD,Productivity more so cares about multi core performance and you wouldn't pick a 8 core CPU with somewhat better single core performance over a 16 core CPU like the 9950 with more than 50% higher performance.

AMD,"Summary:  “While the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was faster overall, the Framework Desktop was consuming more power than the Dell Pro Max GB10. On average the Framework Desktop over this entire span of CPU benchmarks saw an average wall power reading of 133 Watts with a recorded peak of 227 Watts. The Dell Pro Max GB10 meanwhile had a 103 Watt average with a recorded 164 Watt peak for all of these benchmarks. So while the Framework Desktop performance geo mean was at 1.285x, the total system power consumption was 1.29x higher on average and the peak was 1.38x.  If you are investing in the Dell Pro Max GB10 or any other GB10 platform, chances are though you are running AI workloads and other software fully engaging both the CPU and GPU. The Blackwell GPU with the GB10 offers a lot more compute potential over the Radeon 8060S graphics but similarly the Dell Pro Max GB10 pricing is around $4139 USD as of writing and the Framework Desktop around $2928 USD if going for the same RAM and storage capacity. More GB10 GPU benchmarks are on the way at Phoronix.”",Neutral
AMD,I have GB10 in my lab. The real issue with my unit is thermal throttling.  When it reaches 70C throttling kicks in and the performance drops a lot. Forcing additional air using a mini blower it maintains much higher interference tokens/s.,Negative
AMD,The GPU portion will be the juicy bit,Neutral
AMD,"As someone who's mostly into applied math and stats research rather than hardware, I'm always a bit confused as to how to parse these for my own use cases. Which of these benchmarks correspond to decomposing thousands of large matrices/arrays in parallel using Python or R (which I suppose use LAPACK or something like that in the backend)?",Neutral
AMD,"Not mentioned here, but when you start going concurrent performance testing, via vLLM, the GB10 ends up being 4x to 5x faster than the Strix Halo (which itself can be quite faster with concurrency).",Positive
AMD,"The lack of a real efficiency advantage was baffling given Nvidia/Mediatek are using an N3 node. You'd expect higher efficiency, not the same (Halo has +28% geomean performance at +29% avg power consumption).   Obviously the Nvidia chip focus is more on the GPU though.",Neutral

AMD,"That might simply be due to the fact that Strix Halo has a much wider CPU. It's 16 Big Cores + SMT. So at a given wattage, Strix Halo can run at lower clock speeds and thus match the efficiency of GB10.  It also does not help that GB10 is using a generation older ARM CPU cores, with less cache and a strange cluster arrangement to top it all.",Neutral

AMD,You're forgetting 1 thing. Finflex.,Neutral
AMD,"5-10W sounds low to me. Removing the DAC cables only strips off 4W right now, it's more in the 20W range eaten by the NIC.

AMD,The ConnectX card is the big difference maker in value as well. Connecting two is a pretty easy upgrade. If you were going to get only one then Strix Halo would be a better pick if you don't need something Nvidia specific. Even more so before the RAM prices really drove up pricing on the Framework.,Positive
AMD,"> although it's fair to point out half of those are small-ish A725 cores.  More than fair. An A725 in the GB10 has half the ST perf of their X925s, though the gap may close in nT workloads depending on how high each core is boosting there.",Neutral
AMD,Which is offset somewhat by lack of SMT and IPC of an older arm architecture,Negative
AMD,what about it?,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, the GB10's A725 are only paired with 0.5MB L2, that'd be barely larger than 1mm2, i.e. far smaller than Zen5C, similar to Intel's Mont cores  That's the same L2 MediaTek uses for the E-Cores/little-Cores (A720/C1-Pro) in their D9400/D9500  Also the GB10 has a weird asymmetric L3 cache. One X925+A725 cluster has access to 16MB L3, the other X925+A725 cluster has access to only 8MB L3.

There is only one logical explanation for this article:   Someone wanted to cash in on the hype for the 9950X3D2 and chose some existing 9950X3D result as a baseline without any explanation.    With all the results, the 9950X3D2 is up to 30% faster or up to 5% slower than the 9950X3D, for any claim between that there would have been results to go with.

AMD,"Both should be considered, but they should be decoupled when looking at benchmarks. You are right that TCO is important.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, it's supposed to have twice the 3d cache too, so that would be where the real gains are. ISO performance in non cache sensitive tasks would have even been fine, but if they want to hyper bin parts to push the performance too for a very premium price, they'll get a couple whales. I'm guessing this will be somewhat low volume as a part.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no, you can't ignore it, that's how it works.",Neutral
AMD,You just set default to non x3d ccd and pin all games to x3d so that everything running in the background is on the non x3d cores and any non game program that needs more cores will just use both.,Neutral
AMD,"games that do simulation will all want to use combined cache so you dont want them using multiple CCDs. If you got some paralelized simulation software though, yeah it will be good.",Neutral
AMD,This exactly. Games that tend to bottleneck CPUs tend to be relatively easy to run GPU-wise and vice versa. Games that punish both heavily are extremely rare.  Depending on the types of games people play they could experience CPU bottlenecks even at 1440p or even 4K. Bannerlod and X4 I feel are great examples.,Positive
AMD,"It doesn't really matter either way since after all, the use cases are both extremely unrealistic. What matters is that the test stays consistent between benchmarks.  With benchmarks you're not trying to figure out how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game. What you're trying to figure out is how many it's pumping out vs. other CPUs (i.e. the relative performance). Because of that it doesn't really matter whether all the tested CPUs hover around 100 FPS or 600 FPS.",Negative
AMD,"That was 2 years ago (zen3 itself being almost 6 years old) and only worked out because the 5000 series GPUs only went up to 5700xt, so the naming didn't overlap. The last two generations haven't had an XT (we get 7950x instead of 7900xt).",Neutral
AMD,"When comparing 6700k vs 7700k, GNs benching showed that even synthetics like Cinebench had less than 5% MC uplift at stock and less than 6% uplift in SC. Ashes of Singularity had a 2.7% uplift. They did not compare 6700k vs 7700k OCd.   8700k becomes harder to compare because they changed testing methodology and the OCd 8700k was delidded.",Neutral
AMD,They actually peaked at zen 3 in 2021. The couple of moments when Intel was still on 14nm for the H series before Tiger Lake-H and when the Intel U series was still quad core was when Cezanne looked the most competitive.   But they never managed to fully capitalise on it due to shitty supply and shitty OEM cooperation.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly! If you're someone frequently running special software that's significantly impacted by a split cache then you shouldn't be buying a CPU that does that.  Thankfully most software just wants more cores, higher clock speed and higher IPC with increases to cache capacity being a *bonus*. Cache being split, not shared across CCD's just doesn't factor in to it for I imagine most consumers.",Negative
AMD,"I think he means can ignore in a sense that the penalty, while still existing, wont impact consumer experience. If the extra latency means ill open my PDF file 5ms later, thats no problem for me. Its only in heavy load software where it really becomes an issue, gaming, enterprise compute, etc.",Neutral
AMD,"You’re right that it doesn’t matter if your benchmarking is purely academic, but figuring out exactly how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game is important if you’re also looking to understand which GPU you should buy.  You still get to compare relative performance as long as you keep the benchmarks consistent like you said, but if you max the CPU then you also get a real FPS number you can compare to GPU reviews to check whether you’ll be CPU or GPU limited at your target res and settings",Neutral
AMD,"Well yeah, except for the Ryzen 5600 XT, which has the exact same number and suffix as the Radeon 5600 XT.",Neutral
AMD,We also had a 5950X. Stop trying to pretend there is any sort of consistency where there is absolutely none.,Negative
AMD,"No, you said you don't need to pin processes with this and I'm explaining why that's not true. Saying ""just ignore it"" is weird.",Negative
AMD,"in the context of this CPU i don't think anyone is worried about opening PDF files or other basic tasks. the main use case of this is people running demanding software that may benefit from the large core count and cache, in which case yeah they're going to care and be doing their research.",Neutral

AMD,"to be fair, the snapdragon x plus is outdated. It was supposed to compete with the m2/m3 and it's a 4nm chip.

AMD,"22 seconds vs 3-4 minutes is enormous, that's what I would expect from CPU vs GPU rendering. It's far cry from the 50% difference in single core and with only 4 P-cores, the M4 shouldn't be that far ahead. If they were all running on GPU, I would expect intel's Xe2 to be more competitive. Maybe the limited iGPU vram without unified memory really was the issue here, idk.",Neutral
AMD,Because blender doesn't support mobile graphics for Intel or AMD.   Blender 4.2 will be the last release which supports GPU rendering using Metal with AMD and Intel on macOS. Starting with 4.3 Metal rendering will only be available on the Apple Silicon. CPU rendering on non-Apple-Silicon platforms will be kept fully supported.

I say this as someone that would love that SoC, but anything below $3500 would be a downgrade in ram and storage over my $1400 Thinkbook.

Intel in the other hand has went from essentially unuseable IGPU, to being a literal front runner in a few years. Their CPUs have significantly better battery, life, while still offering better performance, even without the need for hyper threading .  Most of the AMD improvements that have been seen in the past few years are in just the 9000 series GPU that's out right now, and they also first came up with the 3-D cash. Otherwise they have really not done anything to warrant all of the glazing that goes around.  AMD made significant strides with RNA's initial launch, but since then they've just been writing the wave  It's a small wonder that they are not seeing any increase to their market cap,",Neutral
AMD,As a Developer I don't even consider windows laptops anymore...,Negative
AMD,"Apple MacBooks are genuinely just some of the best laptops out there today, and that wasn’t true during the Intel days. I would’ve never even given Macs a second look before Apple silicon, but I ended up buying an M1 Pro for college and I have no regrets. It’s performed amazingly, and still gets serviceable battery life 4 years later",Positive
AMD,"Why do articles like this never give actual numbers.  AMDs market share is sinking but its also a shrinking market. People are buying fewer and fewer laptops. It could be just that apple is maintaining their market share in a shrinking market, or not, this article doesnt say.",Negative
AMD,"Where I live, AMD laptops got overpriced to the point the M4 Air is not only a better value, it's outright cheaper.   AMD renamed and overpriced itself out of the laptop market.",Neutral
AMD,"So in other words Intel lost around 40% in market share since Apple kicked them to the curb. That is just brutal. Considering intels  laptop market share is still declining, Qualcomm is pushing into that space and soon Nvidia the air is getting pretty thin for them.",Negative
AMD,Why is this even a comparison when  1. Amd has had difficulties making gains in laptops (not due to consumer devices) because of intel's enterprise relationships which they are investing to counter rn and is at like 25% share 2. Apple ships over 200million units of their products each year  It's almost like tpu is looking for a smaller number to compare apple's share to just to generate a clickbait headline.,Negative
AMD,"Not surprising, Apple makes a good processor and has the mindshare. It's a winning combination really.",Positive
AMD,How much of that increase is because of Microsoft’s pivot to “windows as a service”?,Neutral
AMD,It would surpass Intel if they’d accommodate dual booting again,Neutral
AMD,More competition means better prices,Positive
AMD,The Intel market share is really high because of business laptops. So take this with a grain of salt,Neutral
AMD,"With Windows getting crappier bday by day, falling market share of native windows apps and apple releasing cheaper macbooks, it's a great opportunity for apple to increase their market share in the laptop segment",Positive
AMD,"Is this supposed to be impressive?   M chips have been out for a while but the avalanche of ARM never materialized. The glazing they got on release was crazy. Death of x86! In the end all Apple could do is match AMD. The AMD that doesnt even try to compete in mobile, the AMD that refuses to up production of their mobile chips when OEMs beg them to?",Negative
AMD,Fuck Apple may they go bankrupt,Negative
AMD,"All of the top tier laptops don't use Ryzen, take a look at Thinkpad line for example. Intel is back to their old bullshit where they incentivise OEM'S to kneecap the competition.",Negative
AMD,"Apple has always had a great product, but its market share growth has always been hindered by its price.  Been this way for decades and a new faster CPU isnt going to help much because we've been down this road before and every 10-15 years they abandon their current hardware in favor of something new and better and it still doesn't help them, it mostly keeps Apple users buying more Apple products.    Watch their numbers drop next year as high RAM, SSD and CPU prices push people to buying a Windows Laptop because its significantly cheaper as Apple will not sell anything unless theres a massive profit margin.",Negative
AMD,"I feel like the real metric here is how much more Apple is selling now vs. 6 years ago. People have never made the choice between an Apple laptop with Intel, AMD, or Apple silicon- they're either buying a windows PC (where they might shop around), or they're buying an Apple product, where they get what they get.   That is to say, if Apple released an iPad that ran on Nvidia's ARM tomorrow, Nvidia would suddenly have a huge share of the tablet market within a few years, because people would keep buying iPads. As long as the hardware isn't disastrous, that's a pretty inelastic market. Apple has branding power well beyond what is only justified by the product itself, though they certainly make a ton of very high quality products.",Positive
AMD,Translation: AMD market share plummets as low as Apple silicon.,Neutral
AMD,I think the current state of Windows is also helping.,Neutral
AMD,"> With the expectation of a lower-cost MacBook launching early this year, it could grow even further.  If they price it right. The iPhone 16e had huge potential at <$500, but they overpriced it at $600.",Positive
AMD,Low cost MacBook is definitely a recession indicator.,Neutral
AMD,"The whole Intel ""smart sleep"" battery drain fiasco, I've become a very big Macbook fan recently. Nothing gets close to Apple's battery life and other integrations if you have an iPhone it's really sad that performance wise for most people it's all the same especially reaching that $1000+ price point but nothing gets close to just how much more polished Macs are because they aren't using Windows",Negative
AMD,last number i saw (many years ago) was 11% if i recall (maybe 10 or 12)  this was back in the intel days,Neutral
AMD,I don’t think the low price MacBook will be a thing anymore. The amount of money they save by using less silicon will be outweighed by the cost of dram + tsmc is increasing prices for apple dramatically.,Neutral
AMD,"The discounted M2/M3 Macbook Airs can be had for as low as $700, and at that price point there is no Windows laptop that can match it. Yes, Macbooks are actually *good value* now.  [$750 Laptop SHOWDOWN: Apple vs Intel vs AMD vs Qualcomm!](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1qk3uvx/750_laptop_showdown_apple_vs_intel_vs_amd_vs/)",Positive
AMD,It's also what happens when AMD shows no interest in providing OEM's enough hardware to sell. I can walk into Best Buy and I have more choices in variations of M4 based Macbooks than I do AMD based laptops in total. I just spent a decent amount of time looking at various options when I was buying my Snapdragon based Surface Pro tablet and there's even more Snapdragon options than AMD at retail nowadays.,Neutral
AMD,It's a combination of AMD not really chasing after marketshare because of muh margins and Windows becoming increasingly more and more enshittified. The latter being a far bigger issue that Microsoft still appears to be unconcerned with.,Negative
AMD,Key word: sell  AMD makes some great mobile processors that for some reason you can't buy,Positive
AMD,"I do enjoy when a company breaks a decades-old monopoly/duopoly by simply designing a quality product and seeing the development process through to production.   As an engineer, I strongly suspect a lot of the ""difficult"" industries are fairly easy to crack as long as you don't have constant flip-flopping from management.",Positive
AMD,"Too bad Apple is such an anticonsumer shithole of a company, i really wish i could use their good hardware.",Negative
AMD,"Market share is the share of sales volume over a period of time (usually the period of time is annoying not specified), not the share of total devices in the wild.  Especially if market share has only increased recently, repairs will be biased toward older devices, which won't reflect recent purchasing trends.",Neutral
AMD,Apple never cared to compete for market share. What they cared about is the profit margins on each unit sold. In light of this Macbooks are far more profitable than any Intel/ AMD laptops because of cost controls,Neutral
AMD,"This could be survival bias - it could be that the AMD ryzen based laptops either havent needed as many repairs yet, or the intel ones just have much more issues, or the people who are buying AMD ryzen laptops are more tech savvy and less likely to break their laptop to the point of needing to go to a repair shop.   What’s the average age of laptops you’re repairing? Come to think of it, I don’t think I’ve ever taken my laptop to a repair place.",Neutral
AMD,I hardly ever worked on AMD CPU's too when I worked at a repair shop. Most of them were Walmart Intel HP's and an odd Intel Dell now and again. If you're hardly working on AMD machines that can be a good thing and a bad thing.,Negative
AMD,It's because there's not enough capacity for laptop CPUs they're in low stock,Negative
AMD,"AMD, Intel, and Apple all are not competing for old market share. They compete for new markets.   The new markets today are mostly in Asia.   And to an extent in the US/EU but the majority of the new growth is in Asia.   You can see this globally by observing what type of new steam games are being released. And by where the developer is located.    A lot of those new IP are Asian themed.    This is also why you see Qualcomm making a push into the PC space. They want to break out of the mobile space and into a new emerging market. So think India and China along with Vietnam and Indonesia.",Neutral
AMD,Would that mean that AMD laptops break less often than Intel ones doe.,Neutral
AMD,"same thing in smartphones. Apple only sells like 20% of all smartphones annually, yet takes home more than 50% of the profit in the industry.",Neutral
AMD,"They still manage to compete on the low end while preserving margins which makes them uniquely problematic for windows OEMs to compete with. Apple still manufactures and sells M2 and M3 laptops, and in some markets with some retailers even manufactures the M1 Air, all of the above sold at aggressive price points that are still profitable to Apple   There has been a lot of improvement in windows laptops in recent years so I think the increased competition is doing its job",Neutral
AMD,>Even more impressive as they don’t play in the low-end margin negative volume space.  I don't understand. I'm constantly seeing Macbook Air around €700,Neutral
AMD,"While it's probably part of it, I doubt it's the whole story. Windows has basically been the ""worse GUI that you put up with"" for 40 years, so it continuing to be that shouldn't be that dramatic.  I think a bigger explanation is just cost. While the entry price for MacBooks hasn't moved much on paper, the entry-level MacBooks throughout the 10's were generally not ideal, and you generally wanted to go up the product ladder to get a better laptop if you could afford it, even for general usage, and once you were looking at the laptop you actually wanted, you were spending $2000 or more. That's an inherently limited audience, simply due to cost.  These days, the cheapest MacBook you can buy is extremely solid and has no major asterisks. The price of ""I want a MacBook with a high-resolution screen, a processor that's as fast as the most premium processors on the market for tasks that only need a couple of cores, and has enough RAM/storage that I don't have to worry about it"" dropped by well over $1000 in the last six years, in addition to the massive technological upgrades in new hardware generations (e.g. Coffee Lake to M4).  Notably, there hasn't been a similar cost proposition improvement on the Windows side over the same time, dramatically shifting the relative cost proposition between MacBooks and Windows laptops. This creates a massive problem for Windows, as the whole reason to put up with the ""worse GUI that you put up with"" was generally cost, as boxes that ran Windows were generally meaningfully cheaper than Microsoft's competitors over the years (Mac, OS/2, early UNIX). With MacBooks being competitive or even favorable on cost compared to nice Windows laptops, the incentive to put up with Windows anyway is just gone.",Negative
AMD,it's both. Windows is not good and AMD/Intel are crap vs Apple,Negative
AMD,> and how much is attributable to the ongoing enshittification of Windows  zero. average windows user doesn't care or know about it,Negative
AMD,The M1 was leagues ahead for performance vs efficiency. The Strix Point and Lunar Lake chips that recently arrived at the first time weve been able to get Linux machines running in the same ballpark as the MacBooks.,Positive
AMD,"> egregious charges for RAM/storage upgrades  In fairness, PC OEMs charge similar amounts for upgrades. It's only significantly cheaper if you upgrade the RAM or SSD yourself.",Neutral
AMD,The entshitification of Windows is a relatively new thing so probably not a lot.,Neutral
AMD,"It's had been hovering around 15 percent for a long time, there wasn't a meaningful change in market share until the M series came out 5 years ago.",Neutral
AMD,"Apple was at 7-8% worldwide prior to the Apple Silicon switch. If you saw 20% 10-15 years ago, it was likely US-only data, as Apple has always held much higher marketshare concentration in 1st world markets.",Neutral
AMD,AMD’s version of 14nm+++++++,Neutral
AMD,Windows laptops? I much prefer to work with actual Linux for the stuff we write. The compability layers needed for the same apps to run on MacOS doesnt always play nice... And then MacOS thinks I am stupid and that every single app that I write is a virus and I have to MANUALLY approve it to run it.,Negative
AMD,PC market (in particular laptops) shrinking? Source?,Neutral
AMD,"They ""only"" lost around 20% in market share since Apple left them in 2020. Half of what you are citing though.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes but not really, think its best to look at several research first.",Neutral
AMD,How come amd gaining marketshare on desktops? Intel still has similar enterprise relationships with them.  Or is it because amd offering on mobile havent been any special compared to Intel?   Or amd focused on margin makers & thats where their wafers are going?,Neutral
AMD,>	Amd has had difficulties making gains in laptops (not due to consumer devices) because of intel’s enterprise relationships which they are investing to counter rn and is at like 25% share  Tough shit for them? Why would this make them not comparable?  >	Apple ships over 200million units of their products each year  This is about laptops.   >	It’s almost like tpu is looking for a smaller number to compare apple’s share to just to generate a clickbait headline.  Is there any clickbait here? They pretty much gave everything away in the headline.,Negative
AMD,That is not why AMD is having difficulties. Its simply them not shipping enough hardware to OEMs. For some reason they just refuse to manufacture enough CPUs.,Negative
AMD,"None, the average user doesn’t know or care about it",Negative
AMD,"You can dualboot all you want on a macbook (hence the existence of asahi linux), there's just not a lot to dualboot to.",Neutral
AMD,Apple (and now QC too) has +25/30% higher ST than AMD or Intel lol     The Max options are obviously much faster in every way than AMD chips,Positive
AMD,>M chips have been out for a while but the avalanche of ARM never materialized.  I mean a big part of that is that there's no good desktop OS/software ecosystem option for arm other than MacOS so you end up in a chicken and egg situation. You can get a Win11 Arm machine but you're constantly going to be running x86 code through a translation layer losing all of your sweet arm efficiency to overhead because the vast majority of Windows software has no native arm build.,Negative
AMD,Apple is not an ARM evangelist and does not give a shit. They march to the beat of their own drum.,Negative
AMD,">All of the top tier laptops don't use Ryzen, take a look at Thinkpad line for example.   Could also just be that Intel's mobile lineup is genuinely as good as, if not better with PTL coming out, than AMD's now.   >Intel is back to their old bullshit where they incentivise OEM'S to kneecap the competition.  Intel is cutting down on that type of spending, while AMD is investing more into partner relations. Intel really doesn't have the type of money to be incentivizing OEMs like they used to anyway.",Neutral
AMD,The competition kneecaps themselves by releasing nothing new for 4 years.,Neutral
AMD,"If you check the graphs, it shows that AMD market share has been slowly recovering to it's past peak of \~20% in 2022. Since the M1 came out, AMD's share has been relatively stable, while Intel is down \~15%.",Neutral
AMD,"It's likely a combination of factors.  GenZ is overwhelmingly iPhone users. A Mac makes a lot more sense when you're already in the ""ecosystem"" and own Airpods and an iCloud subscription. Basically anyone shopping for their first college laptop will opt for a Mac unless they're on an extremely tight budget or require certain Windows apps (such as engineering students).  Windows is doing everything they can to make their OS worse, shoehorning AI into everything and trying to do away with the idea of actually owning your computer.  Users rely way less on Windows-specific apps these days. Honestly 90% of the ""apps"" I use today are web-based and work exactly the same whether I'm on Windows or MacOS. Aside from some cases like professionals, engineering students, and gamers, Mac does everything most users need.  The latter two things are less significant factors in my opinion. The big selling point for Macs is that they are competent machines for the money (unlike the Intel-based ones) and essentially sell themselves to iPhone users.",Neutral
AMD,"Even Linux is rising in desktop users, so obviously Microsoft dropped the ball big time.",Negative
AMD,"Have had a MacBook Pro M1 since launch, and a Studio. These devices are rock solid even 4 generations on I'm like ""will an upgrade even make a noticeable difference... hmm...""   In 4 decades of computing (about 2/3 Windows 1/3 Mac), outside of Commodore 64, I'd say the M1 Laptop has been the biggest game changer and most solid device ever owned.   Great battery life, thermals.       No shitty boot issues, random blue screens, overheating, is it waking, is it not, perfect display. Open the lid and it's there \*every time\*. Like \*every time\*.  So 1/2 is the hardware and 1/2 is the OS/Hardware combination. It's been on long hauls multiple times, stuffed in bags, dropped (oops).  It gets used for hours every single day when not at my desk. And battery life is it 83% (!!!!!!)   It's basically the perfect laptop.

AMD,"yup, made me jump ship to a macbook air, 16h+ of battery life is amazing",Positive
AMD,I've been daily driving Unbuntu because with Chat GPT I can now easily use Linux. I only use windows to game because I'm not ready to figure out the gaming end of things just yet.  Recently picked up an M1 MacBook Pro. It certainly has felt like a superior experience to Windows. I'm just not thrilled about stuff like how I cant upgrade my own ram or storage without knowing how to solder. That is bull shit.,Positive
AMD,"It wasn't overpriced compared to the iPhone 16. Now that the iPhone 17 has increased base storage and a 120Hz display it's a no-brainer. If I had to guess, it's not that Apple didn't have the foresight to see that coming, instead they just wanted to make a phone for corporate buyers that had a higher margin than the iPhone SE.",Neutral
AMD,It's not uncommon to see battery life double after installing Linux on a Windows laptop. I have an older laptop that went from a 3.5 hour battery life to 16 hours.,Neutral
AMD,"And they are cold to the touch and not hot. Well, unless you do transcoding",Neutral
AMD,"That they’re 16gb standard new is pretty crazy considering how well Macs manage their ram. They really do just need to make 512gb their standard storage as even w iCloud there’s inconsistencies w how syncing works for photos and messages that unnecessarily eats a ton of storage with no real workaround. It’s disappointing cause they clearly know how to do it when you look at how things are handled on iPhones for both those, meanwhile I’m sitting at 100gb used between those two apps on my m3.",Negative
AMD,"Base model Macbooks are a good value if they meet your needs. You will not find a comparable laptop that has a similar keyboard, trackpad, processor, etc. for the price. But Apple makes their profit on the upgrades from the base model. So this would be in terms of ssd and ram. Those upgrades typically come at significant premiums and is where Apple gets its profit.   On a PC, you can typically make those upgrades yourself. And save a significant amount of money doing so. You can even upgrade your PC's monitor in certain cases. This can be useful if your laptop's screen gets broken. If you had a mac, you'd probably have to go to an Apple store and pay $$$ if that happened.   But obviously if you're not an enthusiast and would never do things like that then it's a moot point. So it comes down to what your background is and what your needs are.",Positive
AMD,"Macbooks, max minis,ac studios, iphone 17, apple watch se, ipad base being good value relative to other products is something I wouldn't have believed if you told me 6 years ago.   Apple offering the best value across multiple segments is just mental to think of",Positive
AMD,"I mean, the pre touchbar macbook pro retina 13s werr good value too, if you dont need a gpu.",Positive
AMD,"> The discounted M2/M3 Macbook Airs can be had for as low as $700, and at that price point there is no Windows laptop that can match it. Yes, Macbooks are actually good value now.  Even more so now because of they're soldered ram. Business laptops are being scrapped for ssds and ram currently so the nonrepairability of apple products actually helps in the second hand market.",Positive
AMD,You american stop assuming that the rest of the world has cheap tech like in america. In rest of the world apple costs way more.,Negative
AMD,that video is extremely biased ragebait,Neutral
AMD,They are never good value when comparing them fairly with equal ram and ssd as well as screens such as oled and 120hz.  Apple's base model devices are overpriced disposable plastic toys that run great for 3 years and then are garbage after that.  If this wasnt the case apple would have double the market share,Negative
AMD,"sadly they come with Mac os, that's a deal breaker for me",Negative
AMD,"> Yes, Macbooks are actually good value now.  Depends on what you consider a good value. 8GB Ram on base model Macbooks is fucking anemic even at $700. Say goodbye to that SSD soldered on board that can't be replaced when Swap eats it up.  Want to upgrade ram? Toss out the Macbook.   I can find $300 craptops that have longer lifetimes before becoming ewaste like that.",Neutral
AMD,"That's another way of saying MacBooks could never match a Windows laptop. The reason for this it's because they don't have the same feature set, I cannot replace my laptop with an RTX 5060 with a MacBook and expect the same support.      Basically you have to limit windows to only doing Mac OS stuff for your statement to be true.",Negative
AMD,"I think this hugely depends on the region. Where I live, Snapdragon laptops are nowhere to be seen... I can, at most, see one model on display, and that is only in the bigger tech shops. AMD and Intel are split almost evenly otherwise.",Neutral
AMD,and the promise of Snapdragon enabling Windows laptops to catch up with Macbooks hasn't panned out.  The silicon isn't the only reason why Macbooks are good.,Neutral
AMD,"That's very regional, in places where I lived, AMD laptops are quite common. Snapdragon tho is non existent, Surface too",Neutral
AMD,Part of that is Apple buying up so much of TSMC’s fab capacity.,Negative
AMD,>AMD shows no interest in providing OEM's enough hardware to sell  NO MONEY,Neutral
AMD,Which ones? Apart from Strix Halo (which are more expensive than Apple Silicon) no current AMD mobile cpu is competitive at the moment.,Negative
AMD,">As an engineer, I strongly suspect a lot of the ""difficult"" industries are fairly easy to crack as long as you don't have constant flip-flopping from management.

AMD,"When said company is anticonsumer and worse than the ones in the duopoly, is that really good?",Negative
AMD,"I suspect that the share of 'devices in the wild' (aka userbase share) of Macbooks are steadily increasing, since it seems most people buying new Macbooks are switching from Windows.

AMD,"higher market share = more people getting to snoop to the wall around their garden  which they like  its probably not the #1 priority, but no doubt that its an important aspect of their ""tactics""  pricing matters, when it comes to this, IMO  and the apple silicon is not cheap but its damn good value compared to intel/amd laptops at the same price points, as far as ive noticed - especially the macbook air  not just cpu performance, but the overall product you buy  its gotten a bit better since the M1, for the competitors though. their screens dont suck as much :D  edit the numbers could also be more iPhone owners who wanna utilize the walled garden options, and getting a macbook is a good way to do that. most people have a laptop anyway. And while most people are more familiar with windows... a ton of people only open their browser and a couple of other apps, might as well utilize the imessage functionality etc",Positive
AMD,"> Apple never cared to compete for market share.

Also the Mac Mini was already a hugely successful market share play. It's an immaculate deal that barely no competitor can beat.",Neutral
AMD,"Laptop repairs are rarely anything to do with silicon these days. It's mostly power problems, the rest is physical damage, busted ports etc.  I don't think tech savvy comes into it, most people can't solder which is the #1 reason they end up on the bench.  Average age is around 3 years, about the oldest are the occasional 9th gen/2019ish era gaming laptops in since people still have and use these.",Negative
AMD,"Could also be that Intel market share has been falling, so there are a lot more old Intel Laptops and the average AMD is newer",Neutral
AMD,I think the most likely answer here is that AMD laptops are more likely to be budget products that get replaced rather than repaired.,Neutral
AMD,Good point. It’s exactly like that.,Positive
AMD,"Putting it like that definitely doesn't make me want to be an Apple customer, and I'm sure Apple doesn't want me as a customer.",Negative
AMD,They’re still not competing with the mass volume drivers in the £200-£300 range. That’s where most are sold. I’d say they have broken into mid-range with their well priced older models.,Neutral
AMD,That’s mid-range. Laptops get a lot cheaper than that.,Neutral
AMD,I think the biggest thing is a lot of people use their phone for stuff now so  most shit has an iphone app now they aren't losing programs/software/apps from getting a mac for big screen shit unless they are gaming.

AMD,Too bad performance isnt the sole metric when deciding on CPU architecture. My point being Apple is far too small in the computing space to affect change like this. Even if their CPUs were 2x as fast. In enterprise Apple is basically non-existant.,Negative
AMD,They also decreased the price of the base Macbook and increased the minimum RAM at a great time. You could have bought a 16GB M4 Air for $800 in many places this past fall and it was an insane deal. You still can buy a Mini for $400-500 with similar specs. I tried to recommend a reasonable Windows laptop in that price range to a friend who was Windows only and there literally wasn’t anything close even accepting a few compromises.,Positive

AMD,"If I were a non tech interested person and wanted a laptop then I'd get a Macbook without a doubt. I'm likely to never own one because I am happy with my workflow and usage with Bazzite, Linux Mint, and W11 with debloating, but Macbooks are ridiculously nice.",Positive
AMD,"Also add in how long laptops last. In the 2000s and 2010s, you could expect maybe 4 years max out of a system, depending on its uses.  Nowadays, a nice Mac will run you more than 5 years, almost guaranteed (assuming your needs don't drastically change w.r.t. memory or storage). That's to say, people will pay more for something that is certainly updated well, doesn't have crap janky features that are ditched after a few years, and have fully performant hardware (versus many PC laptops which will often compromise less-noticeable bits of hardware, like mics, touchpad, speakers, etc).

If the base storage on the MBA was 512GB it would be a much better sell vs the Pro.,Neutral

I'm really interested to see how much longer Apple decides to support the M1 Macs, because there's really nothing holding them back at the moment. The only reason I wouldn't recommend buying one is because Apple tends to stop updating the OS 6-8 years after release.

Intel's own [CES launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLwW8id3efE) (6:38) last year showed them matching the 365 in perf/watt, but the 365 has fewer cores enabled than the HX 370.",Neutral

AMD,"the design of the core, internal bus and interconnects, io controllers, power management systems, etc are all on silicon and are identical if not extremely similar to every product up and down the stack. every product takes from these shared pieces, add in some product specific pieces like GPU bits or memory controller bits, put it through an HDL compiler, and out comes a silicon design.",Neutral

AMD,"You mean bootcamp, not hackintosh. Apple definitely did not promote hackintoshes.   But yes, Apple use to promote Bootcamp as a feature. But bootcamp went well beyond ""supporting dual booting"" - Apple wrote drivers for Windows for that. If that's the standard by which a company ""supports dual booting"", no windows laptop or PC today supports dual booting.   None of them are personally writing drivers for their hardware in Linux.  Apple is not doing that today, but that's far from a simple task either. The simple task is to allow the user to unlock the bootloader and boot into other OSes. Which they do allow.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes it is, personally i wouldn't go for those SKUs if you are comparing Apple to Windows PCs  If you are comparing AMD,Intel and QC then it doesn't matter as those SKUs are still faster than Panther Lake and Zen 5     (i think QC will end up refreshing the X2P and X2 SKUs with the 4.7Ghz clocks next year or by end of year  so they can have a mid cycle refresh for the mid range)",Neutral
AMD,"> Apple would have to bear a major profit fall if they keep their pricing the same, amidst the memory shortages. >  >   Not necessarily. Apple has very likely signed long-term contracts that lock in the price for a while.",Neutral
AMD,"Perhaps, but it depends on what RAM contracts Apple has.  It's probably that they have long term (5 years) ironclad contracts that prevent the big 3 from trying any funny business with them unless they want to get demolished by Apple.",Neutral
AMD,"They've done a pretty good job porting games over that show what MacOS is capable of (such as Cyberpunk 2077), but a really bad job at porting over games that people actually play. EA, Activision, Ubisoft, and Epic all have no interest in porting games to MacOS. Esports titles should be an easy target for MacOS ports since they can basically run on a potato, but we don't see that happening. Most ported games are single-player, which is great for showing off hardware, but not great for convincing people to make a Mac replace their gaming PC.",Negative
AMD,Yeah they just need to create a translation layer like Proton.  Playing your steam games should be hardware agnostic  Maybe they’re just inclined to wait and see if cloud gaming can become good enough and lower-latency for a practically identical experience to gaming with sufficient compute onsite.,Neutral
AMD,"I completely agree. I tried the MSI Vector ($1299) and the acer predator neo Helios 16 ($1350 on sale) and acer predator neo helios 16s  ($1399 on sale)  There was nothing wrong with any of the laptops genuinely but you realize quickly how different it is from a premium experience where the trackpad just is haptic. The cooling is very different. It's slim. It's light. The battery life is insane. The screen has a mini LED screen. All metal chasis which dispels heat. Etc etc There is nothing wrong with these other laptops but you can definitely tell where they start budgeting for stuff to account for the stronger parts   I think most people that just think specs only have a point, but at the same time you're literally paying for better hardware. There's a reason why there's a lot of more expensive windows PCS now because there absolutely is a market for premium experience and hardware. That's not just pure internals",Negative
AMD,"The MacBook Air’s hardware is capable of playing games, the Mac gaming side doesn’t have developer support and Apple is hesitant to go all in like Windows did during the 2003s.

I mainly chose it because it’d be way quieter with my noctua fans, big dual tower cooler, and I already had peripherals.",Positive
AMD,"A MacBook air is a pretty terrible comparison though.  It's passively cooled, which means performance drops off a cliff when it's under heavy load.  It's a fantastic machine, but a gaming machine it is not. Even if Apple suddenly provided Vulcan support it'd be really terrible performance.

AMD,"[Bodging is a Commonwealth word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bodge#Verb) that kinda means throwing things together haphazardly, making things work with blu-tack and duct tape. It's certainly not a negative, just like fiddling isn't a negative with Linux. It doesn't stand in the way per se, it just means you need to *do stuff* to get things to work the way you want, or at least the way I want.  One example is automation. On Linux you'd probably write a shell script to do whatever. Very close to the metal (well, pretty close to the metal for an OS), very powerful, but very fiddly. Not something you'd expect a newbie to be able to do, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. On Windows you might use AutoHotkey, which is an incredible program, but very much a bodge. A kinda non-native layer sitting on top of Windows pulling the strings, with a unique way of doing things. On macOS you'd use Automator, which exposes a lot of native application hooks and lets you use AppleScript (which is user friendly but very... odd in how it's written haha).  Fiddling > Bodging > Tweaking in terms of power. Tweaking > Bodging > Fiddling in terms of user friendliness. Personally, I want to be able to customise every tiny bit of my experience (Linux) or want things to just get out of my way and let me work (macOS), not something in between.",Neutral
AMD,Yep Mac mini is more affordable if you don’t need a laptop  Check eBay for an m1,Positive
AMD,"Oh, got it.   BTW the only SKU out is base M5, not M5 pro. So the Air is likely to be the same performance, around 2x M1 pro. So likely the M5 air will be the same CPU performance as the M1 max (which I assume is what you meant originally?)",Neutral

AMD,">I love how you conveniently disregard the fact that there was a huge architectural change buried in there. We should be having this conversation with the M1 Macs are discontinued.  What?  That is literally my point.   How can OP say they last longer when we don't know that yet with current ones, and old ones can't run modern macOS?      Meanwhile X86 having only minor changes means that there are a handful of nearly two decade old machines capable of nicely running 10, though 11 sets the bar much higher due to TPM and AVX2 requirements.    But even that much higher bar is older than the oldest macs that can currently run 26.",Negative
AMD,"And that conversation will be much worse for Apple, all things considered. A 2015 MacBook Pro is still a very usable machine...since you can install Linux on it very easily and have full working driver support. Asahi, as admirable a project it is, is not there yet. M1's might get stuck on macOS 27 or 28, and with no good Linux support will be destined for the e-waste heap once developers stop releasing new updates or updated root CAs for those versions.   Even the T2 Macs have a bunch of special quirks you need to work around to get Linux installed and working right, since so much is handled by custom silicon.   *And* Apple Silicon also has to phone home to Apple to ""activate"".

I doubt it, just because it would be an admission that their platform isn't inherently just so attractive to game developers.

Like I said, I'm 100% a Windows/Linux/Android guy, I don't like using my fiancee's Macbook or iPhone, but I respect the hardware very much.  So they've gotten more cost-effective, better specs on the lower-end units, and are powered by great chips. It's a no-brainer from someone who isn't married to Windows.",Positive

AMD,"This is clickbait. No AMD CPU or GPU was expected until 2027 to begin with.  Anyone going on about ""but the rumors"" doesn't know what a rumor is. It's hearsay, *fiction*, not basic fact to be validated and repeated. A rumor ever being correct is someone winning a lottery.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, what would they release?  A GRE model with 12GB of ram and get people more angry.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, pretty much 100% clickbait. The post they're reporting on doesn't even say ""AMD has delayed their next gen cards"". It says they've planned to release them in 2027 for a while.   > ""RDNA5 has been 2027 for a while, and they can't launch before NVIDIA anyway.   > NVIDIA margins are massive and they can counter almost anything with a price drop. What AMD needs is something that is in a difference performance bracket altogether, like the 9800X3D is.""   And anyone could have told you there release would probably be end of year 2026 or early 2027.   If they get pushed back to mid-late 2027 that'd be more news worthy, but not particularly surprising giving the current economic climate and slowly lengthening release cadence (this 10 years vs the 10 years before that).   Nvidia/AMD not releasing refreshes for this gen would be out of the ordinary, but that might not happen either. Prices have gone insane on VRAM, and there are higher margin products to sell.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes, which is what they generally do in year 2 launches (RDNA4 launched in 2025 I.e year 1).",Neutral
AMD,Or they could feasibly release a 8GB 9070 GRE with the full bus and 1GB modules. And just market it under the notion that they wanted to release something as cheap as possible with current market conditions.  Would still be a decent e-sports card for a lot of title.,Neutral
AMD,AMD never refreshed their RDNA3 GPU's either.  And there's not a lot to refresh RDNA4 with anyways.  It's just the two GPU's and both already have fully enabled products with higher TDP than necessary.,Negative
AMD,yep just another smear campaign against AMD by the usual suspects,Neutral
AMD,RDNA 4 was rumored for Q4 24 and got pushed back - as far as I can tell - to the detriment of nobody. There's far more reason to be delaying this launch than that one as well. I think this news is very predictable.,Negative

AMD,"Maybe AMD has learned that giving their teams more time to cook isn't a bad thing. There are no shortage of other reasons why delaying makes sense for this year in particular as well. The world will keep turning whether RDNA 5 comes out in Q4, or 2027.",Neutral
AMD,"Oh I just bought a 5060Ti 16GB a few weeks ago to start a new build.  Not quite 3080 level in average native performance, but more VRAM and better DLSS4 performance which I think will make up the difference.

AMD,"To me it wasn't worth the sacrifice of 4GB VRAM even if it was $100 cheaper than the 9070. I got my 9070 for 4199.  I expect stock for it to dwindle though, if the 9070 gets cuts the GRE probably would be a even bigger victim",Negative
AMD,Time to get the old RX 580 8GB out of the drawer.  Ten thousand years.,Neutral
AMD,"No, they lack the memory density. A card has only a handful of slots for memory chips to go, most cards have the same number of slots.  The increase in memory capacity is by the memory chips going from 512mb to 1gb to 2 gb to 3 gb in capacity each.  If you harvest chips from an 8GB then you're going to only be able to contribute to cards around the same size, not a 48GB or 96GB card.  That's the basic concept.",Neutral

AMD,Silly strawman laced with false dilemma.  8GB is not enough for modern AAA games at 1080P. Which a lot of 'filthy casuals' like to play,Neutral
AMD,"Well sure, but if AI wasn't such a party crasher, I think people would definitely care more about this.

AMD,"I think the ideal would be to get to a point where the flagship ""mainstream"" iGPUs (-H series, for Intel) compete with Nvidia's contemporary x50 GPUs, and then have big iGPU chips (Strix Halo, NVL-AX?) to compete with x60+ level.",Neutral
AMD,"Strix halo is a commercial failure. Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.    Intel couldn't care less about that, they just need to be better than 890M and the game is done.",Negative
AMD,I’d love to see its support outside of the approved games demo list. Intel has great hardware but their drivers and game support have always been the biggest question.  What’s the point of hardware if you can’t apply it to what you need.,Neutral
AMD,"If these chips end up cheap enough that they can replace the standard Intel CPU + 50/60 tier mobile Nvidia dGPU it will be very interesting.  I'm not sure they will be able to in the short term, Nvidia pricing on low end mobile dGPUs is very aggressive ($600 5050 laptops are the proof) but hopefully it isn't long before this type of powerful iGPU becomes a common thing.",Positive

AMD,Wtf is this article? Strix halo is another class product. Takes on strix halo being more than 50% slower?,Negative
AMD,"I'm sorry but nothing was more embarrassing than that guy from AMD the other day saying it doesn't matter because Strix Halo, a chip in so few devices that's an absolute behemoth, is still faster.

AMD,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
AMD,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
AMD,"They've basically maxed out the 128-bit normal socket iGPU now.  For them to beat it they need more memory bandwidth - they can put in a bit more cache, but realistically they'll need a quad channel bus (or maybe they can wait for LPDDR6 at 14.4+).  They can probably have a bit more physical room in the next generation of sockets, but without more bandwidth it isn't *that* useful.",Neutral
AMD,"the 140v also got a 25% speed boost post launch, if something similar happens than this could be as good as a 5060 mobile... which is wild! I hope it dosen't cost as much as halo strix!",Positive
AMD,Needs a conroe vs fx62 moment. It doesn't look promising.,Negative
AMD,Why aren't they comparing the AMD 8060S in the current Strix Halo flagship to the Intel B390? Probably because it doesn't go intel's way... interesting.,Neutral
AMD,And yet maybe 5% of customers will buy this version because its absolutely irrelevant for them whether their laptop would have an Iris iGPU from 2014 or a 2500watt RTX 5090.,Negative
AMD,"Thats great. If you are nvidia making dedicated gpu, then better make something that is not shit. 4050 is a joke",Positive
AMD,"But how much does it cost? It mentions it having 16 cores so I'm guessing it's going to be overpriced if you don't need CPU performance, just like Strix Halo.",Negative
AMD,They need a 25% IPC increase to get back to the leading edge in CPU and honestly i don't see it with their current architecture. They need a new radical design   Edit: getting downvoted for what?. Currently Apple and QC have a very solid lead. Even ARM beats Intel and AMD in general CPU workloads and Intel/AMD have been very slow to update their uarch focusing on clock speed over efficiency and IPC,Negative
AMD,"AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 388 just dropped cheaper than the 395 with the same GPU, it will be cheaper than the panther lake.",Positive
AMD,"Depends on Intel's & amd power targets. I dont think its rly feesible for them to target cpu + gpu power usage, 100W combined at least?",Neutral
AMD,then we wouldnt have the 50 gpus anymore. The XX30 and XX40 GPUs died because of iGPUs competing with them.,Negative

AMD,"AMD aimed Strix Halo at AI users first and foremost, thinking those folks would pay the high premiums.   But of course anybody serious about AI would have an Nvidia GPU, and so many other AI users are still just using cloud-based services anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD has always had lower supply compared to Intel and yet AMD client continues to grow. Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel. Strix Halo is still continuing to have designs made, it wouldn't be a 'failure' if we are still getting Strix Halo products at CES...  I wrote a [comment in a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1q7d67m/comment/nyhh23c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the reality of the state of Intel and AMD in the mobile segment. Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
AMD,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
AMD,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
AMD,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
AMD,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
AMD,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
AMD,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
AMD,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral

I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.

AMD,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
AMD,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral

AMD,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
AMD,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
AMD,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
AMD,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral

AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

AMD,PS6 would mark the 3rd successive generation of AMD products in Sony consoles (and I believe the 4th for Xbox). Intel hasn't ever made something like Strix Halo. Console APUs are an entirely different beast to regular ones. Intel has to have something like Strix Halo to show it can truly compete.   Companies won't trade away years of partnership just because another company has good products now. Intel might genuinely have to take a loss to get APU contracts. AMD has also never had an issue supplying the volume Xbox and PS need. They're ridiculously efficient with those chips so Intel's foundry services aren't as big a selling point unless they undercut costs pretty substantially.  I'd be very surprised if Xbox or Sony went with Intel unless AMD completely drops the ball.,Neutral

AMD,"Panther Lake isn't close at all. It's about half the performance. It's much faster than their other igpus but Strix Halo is in another tier. Intel compares their igpu to a power limited laptop 4050 (and they lose still by like 10% iirc). AMDs Halo is compared to desktop 4060 in quite a few cases. That's a huge difference.  Yes, Panther Lake is a great igpu. It's not close at all in raw performance. It's got more advanced technology for sure and its RT performance is very impressive for what it is. But it's also a much newer architecture and it's lucky for them that they are in a transition period for AMD where AMD is unable to put their latest architecture in mobile chips.  Intel's fabs have lost them money. I'm not sure they're gonna bring better value for money. AMDs architecture is just better and they can use less advanced nodes if they so wish.

You won't get the exact *same* result, but it would be strange for an algorithm to rely on that rather than the numerical accuracy of it.  The second concern is far more relevant.

Nvidia claims FP64 performance doesn't need to improve with each generation, because they claim that the Ozaki scheme can exploit the ever increasing number of low-precision tensor cores and make up for the lost performance.  But AMD argues that the Ozaki scheme is only for matrix multiplication, and that many of the HPC applications they have studied don't make heavy enough use of it to result in a net performance gain with emulated FP64.  There's a whole section in the article about the applicability of the Ozaki scheme:  > Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations. > > According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.  > > ""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say it's a tiny fraction of the market, but it's actually a niche piece."" > > For vector-heavy workloads, like computational fluid dynamics, Nvidia's Rubin GPUs are forced to run on the slower FP64 vector accelerators in the chip's CUDA cores.  These facts don't change just because emulated FP64 becomes IEEE-compliant. AMD states that they are presently studying **if** making FP64 emulation complaint can make the Ozaki scheme usable for more applications.

AMD,"Well, you got a point, I phrased that badly.   No, HPL is a politically motivated benchmark with zero applicability in the real world that causes real harm to the HPC world and is horrendously expensive to run.    If you're interested in this, here is a slightly longer explanation (It's a slightly modified copy paste from a different explanation from me, so some things might seem a bit off to you)  It was created to ""prove"" performance claims by manufactures. Back in the day even CPUs had a claimed theoretical max performance, usually in GFLOPS. But what does it even mean and where does this number come from? It tells you how many floating point operations (typically 64 bit) a processor can theoretically do. It's calculated by core count \* clockspeed \* fp operations per cycle. So, it tells you how many operations the CPU can do if every single clock cycle was used to calculate as many operations as theoretically possible per cycle. For modern CPUs, lets use a 7950X as an example: It has 16 cores, runs at a base frequency of 4.5GHz, has two 256 vector ALUs and supports FMA (fused multiply add, performs two operations in one cycle), so it's two operations per cycle on 8 (2x 256bit = 8x 64bit) FP per core on 16 cores 4.5G times per second. So 4.5 x 16 x 8 x 2 = 1152GFLOPS. The same math applies to GPUs where the performance claim is usually still marketed.   HPL is a benchmark that was created to get as close as possible to this number. It's designed to minimize overhead, memory, networking etc, and use 100% speedup from wider vector units etc. And not only that, every single manufacturer has their own optimized HPL version. On intel CPUs you run an intel optimized version on AMD an AMD optimized version etc. To get back to the example, [here](https://wp-cdn.pugetsystems.com/2022/08/hpl-zen4.png) is a test from puget systems with a result of 1011GFLOPS which means a \~87% efficiency.    And that's basically the thing, the more time you spend optimizing, the closer you get to the optimum which is about 85-95% of theoretical maximum. And not only that, if you spend enough time optimizing and distributing load, you can even throw in a GPU and add the performance to the total performance. It's essentially just about how much time you're willing to invest into it.   The problem is, none of that translates into any real world performance. This [chart](https://www.pugetsystems.com/pic_disp.php?id=68180) shows how random many results seem to be (intel dominates there because of their early AVX 512 adoption). In the real world, especially in HPC the software is far more complex and more I/O, network and memory dependent than pure compute bound.    There isn't a single common HPC workload that scales with performance as HPL does, none.   The benchmark exists for the top500 list and to ""validate"" the performance claims. It's for politics, to be able to say ""our supercomputer is faster than yours"".",Negative

AMD,What part is vibes exactly? It's just a fact that hardware fp64 has been sacrificed by Nvidia in the pursuit of AI,Negative
AMD,"I think they mean that hardware fp64 was sacrificed in favor of less accurate formats, primarily driven by AI. Not that the scheme itself is based on AI",Neutral
AMD,Does SSE/AVX support 80-bit or 96-bit floating-point? I thought only the x87 FPU was 80-bit.,Neutral
AMD,"Well not the data centre gpu where it would really matter (Ponte Vecchio was forced out intel’s anus because of the DOE contract, while Rialto Bridge and Falcon Shores are chopped, and probably Jaguar Shores yet be yet another epic fail)",Negative
AMD,"They're not saying so, they're saying you can express more than 18.44 quintillion unique values and that that number is (loosely) given by 2^64.",Neutral
AMD,Alphafold is just one of many different generative AI platforms for protein folding research.,Neutral
AMD,"He argues that using that approach is not in fact better than using dedicated hardware for fp64. He is correct. Nvidia is sloppily rushing this through in a **non-compliant** manner. That means it is premature, not ready for prime time, similar to their new power cable.  > ""We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that's the way to progress here.""  Progress. Not rejection, not stagnation, not moving backwards. Certainly **not arguing against emulated fp64 at all**, merely not to rush it.",Neutral
AMD,"(2/2 I hit the comment length limit)  And that's where the problem starts. I did work at a super computer place at a time where they were looking for a new system. Because most scientific super computers are paid by the state/city/whatever and it's a political thing, HPL is a real problem because politicians want to see results and they only care about HPL and where it lands in the top 500 list.   Thing is that running HPL is horrendously expensive. If you want good results you can easily spend like 2-4 weeks on optimizing and benchmarking, which doesn't sound too bad until you realize that if a supercomputer is used for 5 years, that's 1-2% of the whole lifetime and therefore cost.   Next problem is that GPUs are still not that great in HPC and a lot still runs on CPUs for many different reasons. The place I worked at had zero uses for GPUs as their main software had no GPU support. They had some, mostly for analyzing results (and visualization) that was purely built on CUDA. But GPUs offer like 10x the performance in HPL compared to a CPU socket and are far more cost effective.   But money came from politics and they didn't want a rather small uplift (plans were to spend a lot on networking and storage) and therefore they had to buy some GPU racks and spend less on storage and CPU nodes. And because AMD GPUs were faster at that time in HPL, there was pressure to buy AMD GPUs (which they didn't but they bought a lot of nvidia GPUs).   I can't speak for all supercomputers but at least to me it's not surpring how much more successful AMD is with their datacenter GPUs in the Top500 list (which AMD likes to say for marketing reasons).   Just makes it a bit funny when AMDs only example for the need for native FP64 performance is HPL. I have an idea why.",Negative
AMD,It's still nonsense. AMD says there is no point in offering FP64 emulation and that is wrong. There are use cases where it can be useful and in nvidias case it comes at essentially zero cost.,Negative
AMD,"thats the thing there havent been any new ppc64le supercomputer deployments we know of. historically there has always been at least 1 ppc supercompting cluster operational at any given time, and a new one is usually brought up when they decommission the old one.",Neutral
AMD,"IBM is coming up with their new POWER11, but I don't think there are any major supercomputers planned around it.",Neutral
AMD,Ozaki scheme gives exactly the same precison and results as native fp64.,Neutral
AMD,"SSE/AVX are handled by FP64 SIMD ALUs.  However, modern X86/ARM/POWER uarchs have superscalar FPUs, so they can dispatch multiple extended precision (80+ bit) FP ops per cycle as well for non data-parallel code paths.  Some uarchs also support fused 64bit FPUs, so they can issue 2 FP64 per cycle, or a single 128bit quadruple precision float.",Neutral
AMD,"Like I said, incredibly badly written",Neutral
AMD,"I think you're confused as to what my position on emulated FP64 is. I'm supportive of hardware support for FP64. I'm quite troubled by the direction that NVIDIA is going towards (stagnant or retrograde FP64 performance with each successive generation; and its reliance on the Ozaki scheme as its approach for improving FP64 performance).  >> ""We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that's the way to progress here."" > > Progress. Not rejection, not stagnation, not moving backwards.  The progress that is being referred to here is a call to for more research into the applicability of emulated FP64, not progress in its deployment, given that it is still a known unknown as to whether emulated FP64 is sufficiently applicable as to justify displacement of hardware FP64 or not. This is justified by the preceding context, which you have conveniently refused to acknowledge (emphasis mine):  > It **may** turn out that, for **some applications**, emulation is more reliable than others, he noted. ""We should, as a community, build a basket of apps to look at. I think that's the way to progress here.""  > Certainly not arguing against emulated fp64 at all, merely not to rush it.  Are we reading the same article?  > Even if Nvidia can overcome the potential pitfalls of FP64 emulation, it doesn't change the fact that the method is only useful for a subset of HPC applications that rely on dense general matrix multiply (DGEMM) operations. > > According to Malaya, for somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of HPC workloads, emulation offers little to no benefit.  > > ""In our analysis the vast majority of real HPC workloads rely on vector FMA, not DGEMM,"" he said.  As I've said before, the issue of IEEE compliance cannot change the fact that many HPC applications do not use DGEMM.",Neutral
AMD,thanks for the information,Positive
AMD,"You missed the earlier (a couple of months ago) rumor that Nvidia would drop native FP64 support starting with R100 or whatever it will be called.  Something like the old H100 of course is just fine, but AMD isn't referring to currently available GPUs here.",Neutral
AMD,"Like I said the Ozaki scheme is only for DGEMM. If they need FP64 for other things then maybe native is the way to go. AMD is offering MI430X with enhanced FP64, and the low-precision focused MI450X.  And customers are buying both.  And the emulation isn't an Nvidia only thing. It can be implemented on AMD GPUs if required.    Customers have lots of options.",Neutral
AMD,"Nowhere do they say there is no point to it, in fact they say they are exploring it.",Neutral
AMD,"That's not the point. The point is that fp64, which is required for HPC, is now slower because it's no longer natively hardware accelerated.",Negative
AMD,Did you even read the article?,Negative
AMD,"And when you have working solutions then what's the point? Are they still ""guessing and vibes""",Neutral
AMD,Same die. I kind of assumed xt would always be prioritized and the non xt are just poorly binned ones,Negative
AMD,Non xt is the same die right? It's fused off parts due chip production defects?   Yield of the full chip must be getting good enough that it might be harder to make the non xt chips.,Neutral
AMD,"My understanding was that the base RX9070 was just binned 9070XTs, they've always made up significantly less of the production numbers. I honestly wasn't sure if they were actively choosing to make some of them as the 9070.",Neutral
AMD,Duh? Better margins better card. But it sends like they will still be making some so meh,Positive
AMD,"The 9070 XT was already much easier to find than the regular 9070, even before the memory price shenanigans began. (In Canada, at least)",Positive
AMD,"I'd be curious if the 9070 GRE 12GB won't see a launch. They'll still have some defective dies , and if it's not going to the regular 9070 16GB, I'd imagine a 12GB variant would be a way to get rid of them.",Negative
AMD,pump them out like its the next 2080ti,Neutral
AMD,"With the 5070Ti shitcanned, one would think the 9070XT is now the undisputed bang for the buck leader.   Maybe that's why we've seen the DLSS 4.5 hypebot flood here... To try and head off that sentiment before it starts.  EDIT: GPU tribalism. Wild shit.",Negative
AMD,Company prioritizes higher margin product? Now that’s a shocker.,Negative
AMD,"Hello KARMAAACS! Please **double check that this submission is original reporting and is not an unverified rumor or repost** that does not rise to the standards of /r/hardware.

AMD,That’s largely fine.  Kinda hard to narrow a lineup that is already narrowed enough.,Neutral
AMD,"For a second, I thought they were prioritizing 9070s over 9070XTs and I was thinking “Why?”  Re read it and the title made sense again",Negative
AMD,"9070 should have been a bit more cheaper. I don't think people are buying 9070 over xt, at least in my country.",Negative
AMD,"From what I heard the XT has a higher chance for coil whine, which is one of the reasons I went for the non-XT version.",Neutral
AMD,"Apparently, the XT die yield are so good that there's barely any non XT.",Positive
AMD,Likely has more to do with prioritizing vram supply.,Neutral
AMD,"It's quite common to cut down perfectly good dies in order to produce more of the lower priced SKU, because usually that's where they sell more units.   This effectively amounts to a price increase of the non-xt relative to the xt",Neutral
AMD,"Base 9070 shows up on the Steam survey, the XT doesn't for what it's worth.",Neutral
AMD,Is it possible they can increase yields by slowing production?   Otherwise I think it’s just them artificially cutting down chips based on demand.,Neutral
AMD,"There was a short while here now in EU at the end of 2025 where the 9070 had good availability. And the price difference vs the XT was holding at a similar level as the performance delta or even better. Which made the 9070 a decent deal, since you can gain a lot of performance from OC/power modding.  But now they are back to ""9070 XT minus 50-75 euro"" at best",Positive
AMD,If you think Nvidia thinks DLSS 4.5 will somehow make people buy GPUs they wouldn't want to purchase otherwise you're high. It's legit just an upgrade to the already great transformer upscaling and more frame gen options.  If AMD wanted people to buy GPUs they would focus on prebuilts and laptops.,Neutral
AMD,"Bruh what? That’s the craziest thing I’ve read so far.  DLSS 4.5 hype is most likely not a botting conspiracy because NVIDIA is trying to ward negative sentiment, and more likely due to there being a larger market of people who can test the thing out for free.  Again, need I mention that NVDIA has most likely sold more 50 series cards than AMD has sold 90 series cards? Not to mention that DLSS 4.5 still runs optimally on 40 series cards, and runs at all on 20 and 30 series cards.   This wide coverage of people getting a free upgrade will naturally generate hype.  As for the 9070 XT being the best bang for buck once the 5070 Ti is shitcanned, this will be true, though sadly not as good of a bang of a buck before the whole VRAM apocalypse went down.",Neutral
AMD,"I bought a Gigabyte Windforce OC 5070ti for $750 about three weeks ago. The cheapest I can find it in stock right now is $1300.  With Nvidia saying they're going to de-prioritize the 5060ti 16GB, if AMD can keep the 9060xt 16GB and 9070xt in stock at somewhat reasonable prices then they have the best 1080p and 1440p option.",Neutral
AMD,> GPU tribalism. Wild shit.  Says the fella deluding himself into believing conspiracy theories that don't make any sense.,Negative
AMD,Pretty sure that's just the higher board power pushing the VRM harder. Should be similar if you just power limit the XT to non-XT levels.,Neutral
AMD,Shades of the old Phenom II dual-core CPUs that had four fully functional cores that could be unlocked on certain motherboards.,Neutral
AMD,Also makes sense to push for higher margin since they have the same VRAM capacity,Neutral
AMD,My assumption is that it's a low stock product so they aren't going to sell them for now while they build up supply.,Neutral
AMD,"Thats a given, but both can be true that AMD may also no longer have enough stock to justify the sku.",Neutral
AMD,"That's dumb, both cards have the same exact memory, so making a non-XT shouldn't have any effect on the XT from a VRAM standpoint. Spork is likely correct about high yields leading to low supply of defective dies. AMD really optimized the frick out of that N48 die.",Negative
AMD,The steam survey is hardly scientific and can wildly swing between surveys. You have to look at the long term trends to get a good picture which GPU’s are popular with consumers.,Positive
AMD,"No, as far as I'm aware it's not possible. The likely answer here is that they do not have that many defective chips anyway so they're prioritising the SKU that is sold for more (same chip).",Negative
AMD,"My understanding is that TSMC wafers tend to be batched - switching to new masks takes time and cost more than making everything in one go and keeping dies in a warehouse which are then binned, packaged and put on cards to sell.  There's a decent chance that the silicon has already been produced, and has for some time. They can't do anything to change their quality.",Negative
AMD,"The screaming sentiment in /r/radeon for the last couple weeks has been the polar opposite of this.   Sooo many shrill posts about ""Nvidia supports all of their GPUs with DLSS4.5 and FSR4 is for the newest GPUs only! I'm selling my Radeon and buying a 5070Ti!"". Weirdly including people that claim to have RX9000 GPUs.  For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/s/VcHeMoArKj",Neutral
AMD,Same with some 4 core ones that could be unlocked to 6 (960T comes to mind),Neutral
AMD,more margin on the xt,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, that thing is 'design for manufacture' city, and frankly, given how hard it's optimized for that and how it gets pretty comparable performance... there's a damn good argument it's a flat out better arch then Blackwell given that the latter just doesn't get enough improvement from that new VRAM format to justify the bottlenecks it risks.",Neutral
AMD,"An XT gives more profit than a non-XT, so prioritizing the 9070 XT means less profit is lost.",Neutral
AMD,I'm sure the RX 9070 at 0.14% while the 5070 is at over 2% says enough...  *Also yeah the XT isn't even on there*,Neutral
AMD,"Ah yes direct data from steam with massive install base of primary GPU consumers is not scientific, but r/radeon wild ramblings are facts. Do you believe that earth is flat too?",Neutral
AMD,And TSMC N4P has excellent yields.,Neutral
AMD,Something like that. They can just use 9070 firmware on a 9070xt chip instead of physically disabling stuff on the chip. It certainly would not be the first time lol.   Imagine it being the opposite of the situation when nvidia couldn't keep 3090s on the shelf. They were probably selling the worst possible qualifying chip as a 3090 to maximize profits. So if you got a 3080 it was probably the worst of the worst lol.   This case would be the opposite if demand for the 9070xt was so weak (compared to 9070 sales) that they started selling the good chips as 9070s to move them. You're more likely to get a really good 9070 chip that might even work as a 9070xt with the right firmware lol.,Neutral
AMD,Keep in mind that reddit is just a bubble. The average buyer doesn't hang around on a radeon subreddit so this really doesnt mean too much.,Negative
AMD,"It was a ton of Nvidia bots, since after a few days they suddenly stopped posting basically everywhere lmao",Negative
AMD,And 8 core 1600X out of the box.,Neutral
AMD,"There were at least reports in past months with from people with screenshots with 9070XT's of it showing up on the hardware survey as ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" the same it shows for APU/iGPU graphics.  I don't doubt in my mind both GPUs got outsold by the 5070 and 5070ti but I also have seen that's hard to get actual numbers from Steam so we don't know. But I imagine some percent of that 2+% of ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" are 9070XTs, I'm pretty sure they sold more than 0 9070XTs.  Reminder when the RX480/RX580 were priced against like 2GB 60 series Nvidia GPUs while having 4 times the VRAM and nearly double the performance for the same money they still got outsold like 5 to 1 by the Nvidia GPUs. And this is a pre-RT and upscaling era so none of the bells and whistles/software suite type features would be a reason either. So even in situations where an AMD card is just flat out better in every way, it still usually gets outsold hand over fist, so in situations where it's debatable or worse it's an even wider margin.",Neutral
AMD,">So if you got a 3080 it was probably the worst of the worst lol.  Have the 3080 12GB - below the 3080 Ti, and then the 3090, all using the same die - despite having the EVGA FTW3 version (more power!), it was a dog.     So, can confirm!     (I bought because it was all that was available to buy...)",Negative
AMD,Thing I don’t like being posted - bots  Thing I like being posted - factual  Get your fucking head checked,Negative
AMD,"All screenshots i have seen that supposedly showed this were actually showing the wrong part of the survey, and not the right one where the GPU is supposed to be shown",Negative
AMD,"Got a B850-I and 9800X3D... I do wonder if those affected had done some tweaks, like PBO or BIOS settings.  I do have to say, during my build, I did notice some quality issues with my board. Once i installed my M.2, that stupid toolless metal bar thing bent so hard it made contact with components on the daughterboard. Had to disassemble everything to get to that piece and bend it straight. During the process i noticed that one of the heatsink screws for the VRM had snapped off. So yeah, i wouldn't rule out issues with the boards here.",Negative
AMD,it seems like 9800x3d issue not motherboard at this point,Negative
AMD,"Ignoring the fact that this has been reported the most on AsRock boards but is not exclusively an AsRock issue, the most common feature of these deaths is the CPU trying to turn itself on from a low-power or off state.  Issues like that are difficult to reproduce for anyone other than AMD and the motherboard manufacturers.  It won't be as quick for AMD in relative terms to root-cause this issue like Intel did with theirs.  So in the meantime they're happy to RMA dead CPUs quietly.",Negative
AMD,AMD likely released a very large batch of defective products but decided to stay silent because they know what happened when Intel recognized their instability issues. Asrock just killed the CPUs quicker.,Negative
AMD,This was not the post i needed to see after ordering a new pc haha,Neutral
AMD,Does this seem to effect the 9950X3D or just the 9800X3D?,Neutral
AMD,"> At least five Reddit posts from the past two weeks describe AMD Ryzen 9800X3D systems that stop posting on ASUS AM5 boards  ok  And no videocardz, you being a jackass and disabling my ability to highlight text is not going to stop me from quoting the article.",Negative
AMD,"I seem to recall the 9000 series launch was postponed over a quality issue. I know it's rumored it was over a typo on the box, but I wonder if there's a connection here.",Neutral

AMD,"Given how specific these mysterious deaths are to just the X3D parts and that everyone (except maybe MSI) is affected again, if there's not some underlying design flaw... or perhaps some specific voltage is flying too close to the sun like with Intel's Raptor lake chips.",Neutral
AMD,"Not ideal.  Starting to really side eye the 9800X3Ds....  Had thought of getting one, but think I'll  just stick with my 7800X3D.",Negative
AMD,"When everybody understand that this is a CPU issue not motherboard, yet people still blaming motherboards with eyes wide shut.",Negative
AMD,So is this exclusively an issue with the 9800X3D? I'm not seeing any reports of it affecting other 9000 X3D parts.,Negative
AMD,I’m starting to sweat over here with my Asus X870-P + 9800X3D…,Neutral
AMD,Where's renowned investigation journalist Tech Jesus when you need him ?,Neutral
AMD,"I have never had problems with gigabyte mobos, that’s why i chose it instead of ASUS or MSI, but seeing another 9800x3d being fried questions the processor. My current setup is gigabyte x870x + 9800x3d",Negative
AMD,"This is not news. Dead 9800X3D has been happening with asus, msi and gigabyte boards too besides asrock. But there are definitely overwhelming more reports with asrock boards. My guess is that X3D CPUs have a general reliability issue and then asrock fucked up extra hard with their bios.",Negative
AMD,But when Intel CPUs die everyone and their moms make news about it,Negative
AMD,So the problem is from all Asus 800 series board or 9800x3d?  Because now I am worry that I just buy a 9800x3d + Asus ROG strix B850-F😟,Negative
AMD,What are the chances AMD has been binning the 9800s because of 9850s?,Neutral
AMD,Fuck I just bought an ASUS mobo after having this death trap of an Asrock for the last year LMAO,Negative
AMD,"I wonder about the ratio between ""five dead cpus"" and ""sold cpus"".",Neutral
AMD,"Eeep I have a 9800X3D and Asus B850-I motherboard. Been running great since April, hope this is a rare problem!",Positive
AMD,"So 2 of the 5 listed examples can’t even really be counted. 1 the user had a bent pin that they tried to correct, so we can’t be sure the issue was with the part or if it was damaged. 1 the user can’t even get into bios and has had multiple faults so again you can’t say if it’s the mobo or cpu or something else going on.",Negative
AMD,"so like... maybe the x3d stuff isnt the best after all?  Unless you are ABSOLUTELY gaming at 1080p in esports (or play loads of mmos) just get a normal cpu. These things seem way too risky at this point   Honestly with the pricing being insanely good, Intel Core ultra is supremely compelling now. Free games, cheaper prices, better bundles. SAME performance as AMD at 1440p/4k. WAY better in pro work  or if you simply must have amd for whatever strange reason, get a 7700x or 9700x. Decent pro work, great gaming perf.   - Also consider stuff like the 12700k, 13600k, 14600k. These also support DDR4, which costs far less right now. These cpus can GAME and they do pro work well",Neutral
AMD,"Two time my Asus Tuf B850-Plus completely lost Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and the only way to get it back was to shut off, unplug, hold the power button for 10 seconds, then plug it back in. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi magically reappeared in Device Manager after doing those steps.",Negative

AMD,"It's exactly this. In fact, there's been issues with both AMD and Intel silicon as far back as Zen 2 (3700x) and Raptor Lake for Intel. I personally had two dead 3700x chips, that started to blue screen at idle after just a year in service each. There are numerous Reddit posts talking about this issue from from a few years ago. The silicon is very delicate, and we are reaching the limits of how much power we can push into these chips without damaging them.",Negative

AMD,This is interesting to me. I bought an Asus  x870e Crosshair Hero and 9800X3D in January 2025. Ran fine for a month and a half until one night I restarted my PC and  it just didn't boot back up. Q-Code showed 00 and days of troubleshooting did nothing.   RMA'd the CPU and the new one has had no hiccups since on the same motherboard with the only difference being there were multiple BIOS updates released in between.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, Asrock, Gigabyte, Asus all having issues points to the actual CPUs having issues.    I feel like something is wrong with my 9800x3d PC too, but I haven't found a way reliably reproduce my issues...",Negative
AMD,Didn't Pugit systems notice a similar trend? I remember them releasing stats during the whole Intel scandal that seemed to suggest an issue with Ryzen chips too.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea that's my base case. That or Asrock boards just being more popular at the CPU's launch and being especially prevalent in enthusiast communities leading to them looking like the cause.  I'm just going to pray my close to launch 9800X3D is not affected, it's in a MSI board atm but I don't think that means anything at this point.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree.  It's extremely weird that we keep seeing motherboard vendors getting blamed for killing AMDs x3D chips all the time, it's almost as if the x3D chips are the problem themselves and AMD is just forcing their partners to shift the blame around so there isn't a massive decrease in sales.  Anyways, who gets the blame in Q2?",Negative
AMD,"This is supported by the fact that (a) AMD has been replacing the chips affected by the Asrock failure mode without question and (b) the fact that the failure rate, last I checked, was substantially higher on some batches.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't think it's anything like the Intel situation, and I'm not personally convinced that ASRock ever were actually killing them faster. I think the ASRock community just picked up on it first and started documenting it first.  Gamers Nexus and Wendell from Level 1 Techs have both been trying to get some insight and they can't replicate or make an ASRock board kill a CPU, and they've even been using boards that have had CPUs die in them before.  It does seem to be some sort of manufacturing issue, but Intel's one was pretty much 100% of specific models of CPUs were affected by this issue and would eventually fail.  AMD's issue doesn't seem to be this. I think it just looks a lot more common than it is because of how many CPUs AMD is selling now.",Negative
AMD,Damn I hope I lucked out,Negative
AMD,"We've been hearing about dying X3Ds on ASRock since the start and the occasional GB board, which if it's the same cause would preclude it being any single batch problem and instead more of a general design or systemic issue. Too many reports are on brand new builds, and it's guaranteed there isn't old 9800X3D stock laying around from November 2024 given the extremely high demand it's been in.  Makes me happier to own a 7700X from 2022, but I was planning to buy a Zen 6 X3D part for a drop in upgrade, and the longer this madness drags on the less confident I am in doing so.",Negative
AMD,"Despite having INTC stock I had 5700X3D and it died after 9 months of usage, on Gigabyte motherboard.

AMD,Is it on earlier units?i got mine 2 months ago no problems untill now but im a little bit concerned now,Negative
AMD,It may be a weirdness induced by the upsidedown-cake MCM design that's the signature of Zen 5 3d.,Neutral
AMD,"Or maybe the whole thing is and has always been a nothingburger.  Without knowing the RMA rate it's hard to say a CPU or a MB actually has a problem. 1-2% of chips causing problems is normal, unless a single motherboard or a single bios update, or specific software are causing the problem.  Even when people were blaming ASRock MBs, the whole thing was suspicious, because once a popular news outlet writes an article ""ASRock motherboards are *frying* our CPUs!!!"" everyone with that mobo will find out about it and report it. Everyone else will assume they just bought a faulty CPU and replace it without making it a story.  But without the numbers it's impossible to say what's a real problem and what's completely normal defect rate. Now I guess it's ASUS turn, everyone in this thread is getting scared by anecdotal evidence of 5 (five) unlucky buyers.  And by the way the Raptor Lake issue was real, but it also got out of hand, e.g. people were scared for parts (like the 13600K/14600K) that had completely normal replacement rates.",Negative
AMD,"Absolutely not worth ditching the 7800X3D for a 9000. Unless of, of course, you're an absolute baller competitive FPS player with a 500hz monitor.   I'm gonna ride my 7800X3D until the Zen6 X3D is nearing end of life, then buy one.",Negative

AMD,"Hey, I also have the ROG STRIX B850-I. For what it’s worth, I haven’t been able to find a single dead 9800X3D report with this exact board.  Do you mind telling me which BIOS version you are using? I built my SFF PC in early July 2025 and am still on version 1063. I am on the fence if I should update to a newer/the latest version or not since I’ve read elsewhere that newer AGESA versions could also be part of the issue (I sadly don’t know what “newer” means in that context, it didn’t specifically say which versions).  I haven’t gotten around to use this PC much so far, perhaps 50-75 hours total turned on of which maybe 15-20 hours were more demanding gaming, the rest was pretty much only idling/desktop usage. That’s why I wanted to ask someone with the same board who probably ran their setup a lot more than me for their input.  I mostly kept the BIOS settings at stock, besides enabling EXPO and adjusting some fan curves.  Thank you!",Neutral

AMD,I thought you were talking about never waking up and not the chip,Neutral
AMD,"I've used PBO to set the thermal limit to 90C, at least that option is buried under the PBO menu. Also limited VSOC to 1.2v. No idea if any of this is a risk, although its meant to reduce spikes, power draw and noise.",Neutral
AMD,Seems like sleep state is killing a lot of these CPUs. Or waking it up from sleep state.,Negative
AMD,I feel like my 5800x3D has degradation on the memory controller as well. Launch unit so among the oldest out there but still,Neutral
AMD,"Yup - restarting, waking from sleep, or even turning on after a couple of days being off - all these actions seem to be the moment the affected users reported failure.",Negative
AMD,"Unlike the Raptor Lake issue, this X3D issue manifests as a CPU at 100% working and then 100% dead. If you're getting inconsistent crashes or wonky behavior, it's most likely RAM.",Negative

AMD,What issue you have?,Neutral
AMD,"Yea, they said AMD failure rate was higher even on top of Intel drama - iirc",Neutral
AMD,"I've been on a x870e Nova for about a year at this point. If I was one of what looked like a set of fishy batches, she'd have died by now I'd think.",Negative
AMD,I'm still leaning towards it being because ASRock had the most compelling lineup this time around. A lot more enthusiasts having their mobos means more posts with traction with their boards when there's a failure,Neutral
AMD,"It's also seeming to be associated more with some batch numbers then others last I checked, which to be fair was a while. My guess is that this is a 'quietly replace dodgy chips as reported, dissect failed MCMs as they arrive, quietly revise Zen 6 with whatever they find if it's a design rather then batch issue'.",Neutral
AMD,Me too. I built my most recent rig in late February / early March of 2025. So the CPU I got was fairly close to their release date. I have my 9800X3D in a X870 Steel Legend WiFi at the moment and it has been flawless so far. I did buy a X870E Taichi as well on sale to upgrade but have not swapped them out just yet due to all this. Not sure if waiting is really going to make things better or not. I should be getting my 5090 in a few weeks. I will make my decision to swap the boards out at that time.,Positive
AMD,"The affected userbase seems to be small. I personally own a 9800x3d in an Asrock board and had no issues so far. Latest bios, pbo ON set to tjmax=85C. Many other systems running fine.had the system for more than a year now",Neutral

AMD,What was AMD’s response?,Neutral
AMD,"Well, yes, it would be much better if AMD could just tell us what's going on.",Neutral
AMD,I purchased mine in July. It was solid until October/November.,Positive
AMD,"Valid points. So many instances were just bent pins or a bad install, some of the most vocal people on reddit in the end had bent pins. Even in the above article there were more bent pins discovered by one user which rather invalidates that result.  It didn't help motherboard vendors were using some crazy high voltages for the first year of AM5, and I don't just mean the VSOC either. But that shouldn't be a factor with current chips and 99% of new builds because anyone using a 2022/23 dated UEFI would be having enough memory headaches to have updated by now I'd hope.  It's just annoying how this problem won't go away, if it was just \~5 reports I wouldn't give it any thought. But then something utterly random like that cafe owner using ASUS boards having a 10% failure rate on 9800X3D systems makes the news. It's always just enough to make me wonder. I use an ASRock board with a 7700X and I still swear it's the best computer I've built since 2006 with the Core 2 Duo E6300. And I've built many Intel rigs since then and now. These questions are not enough to put me off my planned Zen 6 X3D upgrade but I will not be happy if this keeps going on with whatever the next-gen X3D part will be called.",Negative

AMD,Yep. I just tinked with the per core CO and left everything else well alone.,Neutral
AMD,"On the Asrock Reddit loads of people have said it started with long boot times, inconsistent booting etc so your statement isn’t necessarily true.",Negative
AMD,"Not neccessarily - my two dead Raptor Lake CPU's worked fine unless you put on a load on them. Then i started getting internal compiler errors, memory corruption and random freezes. CPU replacement fixed this, then second CPU died, now same memory lives happily in an AMD CPU.",Negative
AMD,I tested my ram with memtest86 though.,Neutral
AMD,"As someone with the same combination, I'm not worried.   I bought a Gigabyte board because they had the least reports of 9800x3D killings. Even Techyescity's video showed that Gigabyte had the most conservative voltages, which may or may not be the reason they die.  Seeing them being conservative with Bios updates makes me confident in them as well, MSI and Asus have released Bios updates (Agesa 1.2.0.3E) too soon, with lots of issues, meanwhile Gigabyte is more slow and stable this generation it seems. However some of their bios settings were in Spanish for a while which seemed a bit incompetent lol",Neutral
AMD,"Asrock also had the least problems on AM4. Few of the boards had the usb dropout issue, they lasted well and had big enough bios chips that they were about to be the only partner that was going to keep all of the AM4 CPUs working on x570 and b550 until AMD backtracked  And I followed sales in my country closely for the first few months of AM5 and Asrock always had a minimum of 4 boards in the top 10",Positive

AMD,Are you saying it works on your machine?,Neutral
AMD,"Oh man, so it's gonna be essentially the same performance about a quarter of the price… Goddamnit it signed me up  This is what you don't seem to understand, the 395 needs like 150 W to get its peak performance, and it's being sold in systems that cost $2000-$3000. And doesn't come with upgradeable memory either.  The Panther Lake stuff is offering the same performance, it's gonna have access to XESS in gaming, which is massively better than FSR three, and it's also gonna cost a fraction of the price  😅. Not gonna lie, I love how your poster ended up, coming out as a straight up advertisement for panther Lake",Negative
AMD,"a poorly written microcode does nos mean defective chips. 13 and 14 gen i7 and i9 problems came from poorly written microcode that requested wrong voltages from motherboard did it not? You implied that problems were due to defective batch, which they didn't.",Negative
AMD,They only confirmed the chip was authentic. They couldn’t read the QR code either,Neutral
AMD,"So, tell us based on 5 claimed CPU's ? Out of how many. There is no fucking way any company could survive, if they started commenting on every possible reddit thread of dead component or product.  Intel did coverup for YEARS on massive number of dying CPU's. Thats a problem you need to adress. Or if you have certain mobo maker burning up (and i mean literally) CPU's, kinda like asrock.  This ""reporting"" was so poorly done, no actual linking things, other than ""asus board"" and ""x3d"". Didnt even bother to find out if they had any link in bios revisions, microcode etc. I found couple threads of dead CPU's (was that even confirmed on all?), ill just write a story pointing fingers at Asus, not AMD im guessing.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, but I guess the independent media outcry isn't loud enough, and AMD appears to be on the road to sitting it out in the hope everybody just forgets about it.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes. I bought a new 9950x3D, RMA'd the faulty one, received a replacement, and returned the new one I bought. What a rollercoaster.",Neutral

I'll be doing my own benchmark numbers soon, but I can only compare 5800X vs 9800X3D since that's all I have.",Neutral
AMD,Isn't that usually worse?,Negative
AMD,Just the sheer size of the pool of people that have OC memory profiles causing random issues is bound to overlap with dead CPU issues.   On the Raptor Lake degradation problem it was particularly problematic because memory instability and core degradation symptoms had a large overlap. People would swap in a new CPU with new microcode and still crash in UE5 games every 1-2 weeks from unstable XMP profiles but never think it could be the memory.,Negative

AMD,"My x470 taichi was a champ, there was a reason I found it so unsurprising that the 800 series lineup from them was also top notch.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah.   To me it feels a bit like the 12VHPWR connector issue on the 4090. Reddit was full of users posting pictures of their burnt connectors, yet NVIDIA’s investigation revealed that only a small portion of users were affected.   Likewise, 9800x3D burning is a real thing, but so far no one has been able to pinpoint a cause. Even re-using the same mobo that killed a previous CPU is not enough to replicate the issue.   Taking into consideration the popularity of this CPU and the fact that it sells well, if it was a widespread issue we would have heard many reports of failures. For reference, on Amazon’s product page it says “1K+ bought in the last month” in UK. And that s only 1 site in 1 region.",Negative

AMD,You bring these ‘statistics’ as fact when it’s you scrolling forums and making assumptions? Bold move.,Negative
AMD,No I didn't. You just don't know what I'm referring to.  I am talking about a specific batch of only 13th gen chips that experienced an oxidation issue that was separate to the voltage and microcode issues.

AMD,">To me it feels a bit like the 12VHPWR connector issue on the 4090. Reddit was full of users posting pictures of their burnt connectors, yet NVIDIA’s investigation revealed that only a small portion of users were affected.  Yet over tens of thousands of people still got burned by it, the number of 12VHPWR burnt cards steadily going through repair shops is mind boggling because they often will have the warranty denied. It was even mentioned in the recent Brother Zhang repair shop video. Having to treat the cable as if it was made of paper because it can't be bent, or angled, or tugged on, or pulled because it messes up the pin alignment is a joke. People that ran 4090's for years without problem do a board swap, or a rebuild, or just carry the thing outside to dust it and the cable isn't positioned straight when they lock the side panel closed and it's all over for their GPU. It's an inexcusable design when a slight bend in the cable can disrupt pin connections in a way to cause the entire connector to fail. People could abuse the hell out of PCIe 6pin and 8pin cables, even bend them at 180 degrees to hide them and it was safe to do so.   At least when AMD's CPUs die mysterious deaths AMD is graciously and expediently warrantying them. But you'd have to buy more than a half-dozen 9800X3Ds to equal the cost of a 5090 today. There was no reason to design the cable with practically no safety margin let alone for a product that now costs more than some people's cars.",Negative
AMD,"Lol do you realize there ARE NO 395 laptops with a dGPU. And the 395 laptops cost a fucking fortune?  You just contradicted your own statement   The panther lake costs WAY less (aka same gaming perf for these ""gamers who have no money"") AND they are paired with dGPUs lol  You completely destroyed yourself in the comments  I'm not sure I've seen someone completely dismantle their own arguments so effortlessly 😅   - panther lake matches the 395 in pro work and gaming. It costs less and ALSO can be paired with a dGPU. It's literally better in every single way 💀",Negative

AMD,"We just don't know the total number of failures for either Nvidia GPUs or AMD CPUs. They are higher than normal, but these products have also sold truckloads of them. Even 2% would mean lots of impacted users.  I've not heard of any AIB denying RMA because of the burnt connectors, there might be cases but I am not aware, at least in Europe.  Anecdotally, I have both a 12VHPWR connector (before the revised spec) and a X870/9800X3D system. I took my system apart many times and had no issues whatsoever.  My point is, chances of the person reading this comment being affected by these issues is small, and if you don't want to deal with it, there are plenty of alternatives.",Negative
AMD,I have worked for AMD. Its a terrible company that unlike Intel is not not pushing forward in tech so much. The 395 is such a Halo product which was never meant to be purchased by anyone. Zen5% and eventually Zen6% along with the whatever AMD is launching as the new RDNA while not supporting FSR on them in a year and dropping support for them quickly. Panther Lake is a much superior setup with Intel oneAPI which is straight up better than ROCm. There is so much wrong with AMD and bow that their focus has been with AI that leaves Intel to innovate and give us much better products that AMD has ever. AMD competing with Nvidia has yielded nothing LOL.,Negative
AMD,"Is Karhu the most stringent? I don't mind paying actual people for good software. They know how many times the software is launched each day which is kinda sketchy, but it is what it is. What about OCCT? I've personally experienced MemTest86's inability to find errors despite the memory clearly erroring out in regular usage.",Negative
AMD,Is memtest86 even able to detect infinity fabric errors? I have had overclocks that passed all ram and CPU stress tests and as soon as I added a VRAM stress test I get rounding errors within 10 minutes.  Ryzen is so finicky that you have to bench everything at once (and it was not temp related because I have everything covered by custom loop).,Neutral
AMD,"The feedback exists for the GPUs, outlets like GN reported information from AIBs as well as etailers and repair shops each, and all three indicated a significant increase in returns, warranties, and GPUs with burnt connectors in for repair.   The 1.10 factor safety margin on the cable has been calculated to the nth degree by almost every youtube hardware channel.    No alternative exists to the 5090. Even the 4090 now costs more than a 5090, and the 9070 XT doesn't even match a 4080.   I'd love to buy something not from NVIDIA, and absolutely something not using 12VHPWR, but I'm not going to invest in a card that's underpowered for what I need, has too little VRAM, and especially one that has a shorter warranty period. On average I buy a flagship card and then keep it for 6-8 years to get the value back out of it, my last was a 1080 Ti that I would've kept on using except a forced monitor upgrade to 4K was too much for it to handle. So don't get me wrong, I own a 4090 and I treat the thing like it's a glass explosive. I also use an ASRock board for my 7700X and wouldn't even consider swapping it for any other brand. I'll agree the AMD issues seem to be very minimal, but there simply is no excuse for the 12VHPWR thing. As per denied warranties I've read about the occasional one, but I have no idea how prevalent it is. In the Brother Zhang repair shop video Zhang mentions people are sending his shop burnt cards because they were outside warranty or because they were imports (such as from Taiwan) and so they couldn't make use of the warranty that the card had.",Neutral
AMD,"TLDR: If $10 is so much that it puts you off then use the free version of HCI and OCCT. Otherwise yes go pick up Karhu ram test, I definitely think it is more than worth the money.  HCI and Karhu are pretty comparable when it comes to results, though Karhu runs significantly faster and feels like a more finished product. Karhu 2.0 is also coming out pretty soon which looks even better.  I have not tried OCCT for memory testing, though I do use it for GPU and CPU stress testing. I do not like that you basically have to subscribe to their Patreon for $6 per month if you want to run tests longer than an hour, whereas Karhu it is a one time payment of like $10.   HCI's Memtest pro is just a wrapper for the free version of Memtest that runs several instances of it at a time, so really you can do that all manually yourself.   If anyone also has Karhu I would suggest trying out this neat gui expansion for it: https://github.com/jjgraphix/KGuiX",Positive
AMD,"I'm totally cool with paying $10 one time for good software, especially since it's just one guy, from my understanding. I won't use OCCT on principal for going with the subscription model. Sounds like it's best to use a couple different tests, though? Say, Karhu and TM5?",Positive

AMD,What are you?,Neutral
AMD,"Intel has outright said that the P-core architecture is very similar to what they have in ARL/LNL. Intel has also shown us that the Fmax of PTL is *lower* than ARL-H and on par with Lunar Lake.   ST perf is likely, at best, to be a draw against ARL-H. Uncore improvements might be able to improve PPC marginally, depending on the workload, even if the core architecture couldn't.   nT perf could improve marginally given the stronger core setup (4+8+4 *proper LPEs* is stronger than 6+8+2), but even for that, Intel is claiming only ""on par"" nT perf with the HX370 in Cinebench 2024 and 2026.   Gaming perf with a dGPU is kinda a toss up IMO vs ARL-H. Better mem latency, prob better L3 latency, but smaller L3 capacity, fewer P-cores, and lower boost clocks. I don't think Intel has commented anything about this either.   There's also been a bunch of GB6 leaks that support the idea that there will be no ST uplift vs ARL-H.",Neutral
AMD,Apple dominates the industry in a certain market (low power and single threaded performance) but they certainly aren't hands down the best CPUs in the industry and they've always had certain advantages over their competitors that aren't related directly to how good Apples CPU teams are (node advantage over others + their own OS + soldered memory + designs focusing strictly on efficiency at low power). I find the reputation of Apple silicon to be a bit too high for what it is overall. Certainly amazing CPUS but not the end all be all that some people treat them as.,Negative

AMD,"Apple has pretty good multi threaded chips for laptops too like the M4 Max. Intel is on N3 and Apple laptop CPUs are just better in terms of performance per watt.  Plus we seen M3 and lunar Lake on the same node and M3 CPU is more efficient and faster than the Lion Cove in Lunar Lake. Also soldered memory and node advantage has nothing do with good cpu performance, Panther lake has soldered memory and a better node and yet the M5 CPU is faster because it has a better design.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, they're pretty good but very clearly a few steps below where they sit in single threaded performance.  Intel is also on an architecture that's burdened with Windows (which is a far worse OS in terms of battery life and bloat and which isn't tailored to those CPUs like MacOS is for Apple) and which wasn't targeted for low power usage until just now. Lunar Lake is their first real attempt at that and it's miles closer than any attempt before it. Before this it was basically just the desktop CPU that was fit into a laptop.  M3 was Apples 3rd gen. Again, Lunar Lake was the first for Intel and iirc Apple actually helped make N3 in the first place so they're far more familiar with the nodes when they develop their CPUs. And Lunar Lake is a chiplet design iirc which has some inherent issues with efficiency and means that it's not pure N3 but a mix of more and less efficient nodes.  Having memory on the same SOC and the Node advantage absolutely play a critical role in the performance Apple has achieved per watt. It reduces power consumption and allows much higher bandwidth and reduces some of the logic Apple needs to make.  Also, have we seen the benchmarks for 18A? I'm not sure it's better than N3P. Definitely more at home for Intel though.  Do you have some benchmarks for Panther Lake CPUs? The only ones I've found focus on the igpu.",Neutral
AMD,> Intel is also on an architecture that's burdened with Windows […]  That's really isn't how architectures work … There's actually *Windows on ARM* existing too.,Negative
AMD,"I know. But Intels processors will mostly be used on Windows. Apple couldn't care less about what performance on Windows is like for the M series and people don't expect them to provide great support for that platform like they do Intel. When you tell people that Mac doesn't perform as well on Windows they'll blame you for using Windows in the first place over MacOS because it's basically a package deal.  Intel processors meanwhile need to support a wide range of OSs well and Windows it's most commonly used partner is a resource hog. Zen 4 and 5 processors gained 10% improvement in gaming via Windows updates. How insane do you think that is?  Also very importantly, the people who make the OS are much more disconnected with the people who make the processors for most computers. Windows is inefficient because it's catering to so many different architectures. Arm, X86 and RISC and all the companies that work with them such as AMD and Intel. MacOS only supports Apple products to such a degree. That means there's a lot of optimization tricks it can do for Apples M series that Windows can't for fear of disadvantaging other companies in favour of one.",Neutral

AMD,"The only way to know is to do whatever it is you're going to do on the PC and look at the ram usage.  If you get 32gb and your games/work + any open software and stuff never get past 15gb, then the extra 16gb stick is literally doing nothing and was a waste of money.  (keep in mind browsers allocate more ram than they use, so don't count those as they allocate it, but give it up when something else requests it, and they put hold on tabs that are not in focus releasing that from ram if idle long enough, etc..).  Just assume ""browser"" is going to use like 5gb MAX unless you have open browsers on like 3 displays all playing videos and HTML5/js games at the same time.   I doubt minecraft or sims 4 needs more than 16, and probably leaves plenty of headroom to do other things at the same time within reason.   Buy a 16gb kit, install it, play your games and look at ram usage, if you're maxing it out or identify a bottleneck, return it (so buy somewhere u can return), and get 32gb kit.",Negative

For an extra 100w of power usage you are getting about 10-15% more performance with a 9070xt over a 9070 but when you are already hitting 100+ fps in games it's not a huge deal.  Avatar: Frontiers of pandora runs at over 100 on high  Indiana jones and the great circle runs at over 100 on high  Fortnite on max settings including raytracing is over 130fps.

AMD,Consider the 9060xt 16gb. What monitor do you have. That really matters! 1080p-1440p-4k is a huge difference. As is the frequency. Doesn’t matter if your GPU can push 600fps if your monitor can only output 120fps. I’d rather get a 9060xt 16gb and a monitor upgrade than a 9070 or 9070xt.,Neutral

I've beaten myself up countless times for not upgrading my wife's 5700g when the 5800xt was selling for $125 last year. Regardless upgrade and sell your old 3600 with the wraith prism that's included with the 5800xt. Easy $75 to put back in your pocket.   You have a good plan 👍  Also my wife's case has the 160mm clearance and it works perfect. Her ram sticks were a tad tall so I the first fan up a tad and doesn't affect anything! Or you could move front fan to the back and only lose 1-2 degrees of efficiency 🤟",Positive

AMD,>My CPU is running very hot and some games that I have played for years are starting to freeze my computer and I have to forcefully turn it off and back on.  Have you tried reapplying the thermal paste on the CPU cooler? That’s the most likely issue.,Negative
AMD,That’s about as good as you can do since the x3d CPU’s are so expensive now. Can you run your ram at a higher speed? You’ll see a good improvement if you can,Positive
AMD,You don’t need an upgrade. You need to remaster it and maybe get a better cooler. I’ve had a 3600 for 5 years and it champs.,Positive
AMD,Very good plan! That's gonna be your best bet for sure,Positive
AMD,Do consider getting a 3200 Mhz RAM kit if possible later down the road. It makes a noticeable difference.,Positive
AMD,kinda sucks that I saw a 5800xt going for like 150 a few months ago but I figured it would be even cheaper in like 6 months or a year when I was planning on upgrading.,Negative
AMD,"Both great choices. Unless you trip over an msrp 5800x3d, that's the best you can get without going ddr5",Positive
AMD,i like the aesthetic of the one on amazon with the digital display and its only like 10 bucks more than the non digital display one.,Neutral

AMD,"I almost bought that one, but reviews were inconsistent about the reliability of the display so I played it safe and got the PS Evo off eBay for $40 total, been satisfied so far!",Positive
AMD,I guess I'm a little confused. The fan on the cooler will block the ram stick? If that's the case you can move the fan to other side of the cooler if that doesn't bother your aesthetic,Neutral
AMD,"I would say 5800xt. It is cheaper than 5800x for some reason and a Lil faster. Buy a beefy air cooler tho, nx600 or pa120se",Neutral
AMD,"You may want to try anyway, in case you have other faulty components that are causing the freezing/crashing (eg could be bad mobo, ram, PSU)  If one of your other components is bad, that may change your purchasing decision. _Eg if it’s a bad mobo you may want to switch to Intel and get a faster 14th gen CPU for the same price._  Also, right now you can’t really sell the CPU in good faith as “working condition” because it could well be faulty. That changes how much money you get back from selling it.",Negative
AMD,"the display model is just the ps evo with a magnetic attachment that has a single connector for the mobo. you could probably buy the magnetic attachment/ display thing separate if you wanted. i just look it because i get curious about temps. i dont have to like run a separate program to see where im peaking at.   it is a software start at windows (there is a linux program as well) but the software is barebones, hence the ability for fans to make a linux program.",Neutral

AMD,"No, they run quite hot, and a twin tower, dual fan is likely what op will need, possibly an aio if planning on an oc",Neutral
AMD,"You can get offline and line interactive UPSs with pure sinewave inverters, theyre just a little more expensive.  For calculating what size you'd need, you will need to figure out the power consumption of your pc as well as any extras (like monitors) you plan on having plugged in. I tend to recommend just getting a 1500va unit though, more run time and they dont cost that much more than a 1000 or 850va.",Neutral

To be honest, I don't trust my power supply because it's the first time I've used a power supply from this brand. I honestly don't know how this PSU will work with a UPS. My only goal is to be able to shut down my computer properly during power outages. I don't think I'll be using the battery for minutes on end, which is why I chose the 1000VA model.",Negative
AMD,"Schneider here in the states is APC. They've got a pretty good reputation, I would trust it personally.  Its pretty hard to find stuff specifically sold in turkey, outside of the data center specific stuff from vertiv and tescom.

AMD,I don’t see a bottleneck. Enjoy it and that badass 7800xt until it can’t play the games you like playing.,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, your pc is good. This is a horrible time to be upgrading, especially with only $1000. ddr5 ram alone is like half of your budget, and the upgrade will be miniscule.  There's no worthwhile upgrade for your am4. Your gpu is great still.   I'd say consider a monitor, peripherals, or chair upgrade honestly. Lowkey lighting upgrade is underrated, having dedicated warm ambient and task lighting is much nicer than bright overhead lighting",Negative
AMD,"If you’re really itching for an upgrade that would be a 9070xt and a 5700x3D.  It might be a little over 1000$, but it would be a killer upgrade. Additionally I should add your current PC is already really good. But if you have the itch, the cash and want to upgrade what’s the route I would go.",Neutral
AMD,U don't have one but since I saw u put 1000 aside for the upgrade why not just upgrade to am5? For 800 u can get a 9700x a gigabyte b850 mobo and 32gb of ddr5  https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HghWPJ  If u can swing it get the 9800x3d,Neutral
AMD,"Put that 1000$ back in your savings account because now isn’t the time to buy a new platform. RAM is absurd, new GPUs that would be a reasonable improvement over a 7800 XT are rising in price fast, and AM4 X3D chips have been out of production for over a year and are insanely expensive.  You could do a 9070 XT and a Ryzen 5700x if you have a micro center near you and that money has a bomb set to detonate in a day I guess but, frankly I’d just ride out what you have for a couple years more if you don’t have any actual problems.",Negative
AMD,"Bro, invest that band  Your PC is perfectly balanced",Neutral
AMD,I have a similar spec pc. I plan on getting a 9070xt than moving to am5. Ill prob go with a 7800x3d.,Neutral
AMD,"As others have said, you’re better off holding the $1k for an upgrade later down the line.  But if you absolutely HAVE to go to AM5 RIGHT NOW, just get any of the X3D chips with 32 gigs of RAM. The 7800/9800X3D will give you plenty of headroom for a long time, while the 7600X3D (if you’re near a microcenter) would be cheaper + probably better suited if you’re planning to upgrade again on AM5  Again though… you really don’t need to upgrade",Neutral
AMD,"I saw your update but bottlenecks happen no matter what and change depending on what games you play. The goal is to minimize this bottleneck.   An ultrawide will help shift the load more to the GPU though, which is more ideal tbh",Neutral
AMD,>Casually comments he's using Linux without nobody asking nor being relevant at the bottlenecking   The slander is real,Negative
AMD,"U mean from a normal 1440p to and ultrawide 1440p..30% increase in pixels...try it first see if u are ok with the decrease in performance. 7800XT is a good enough GPU but likely struggle with RT.  Without a GPU upgrade, the other upgrade may yield minimal improvements, especially on an 1440p ultrawide..something which u may not be happy with. Getting a 9070xt may be an alternative option.",Neutral
AMD,"Dawg, I have $1000 set aside for this lmao, so Im definitely going to be upgrading, Im just not sure what to",Neutral
AMD,Then wait set aside 2k and blow it all when the next gen releases.,Neutral
AMD,Retirement,Neutral
AMD,"Listen to this man. You've got a solid 1440p rig that will play any of today's games. You'll be paying 1k just to see your fps counter go up at this stage. Invest that money. Ideally into a tfsa or retirement.  But if not, I'd buy ETFs now and in 2 more years use that money to overhaul when it's worth it and your money grew",Negative
AMD,Save another 1k blow it on a 6080 next year,Neutral
AMD,"You don't have a bottleneck right now, you can upgrade, but you will not see a performance increase other than 1% lows most likely. If you are upgrading now with the intention of being able to upgrade the GPU later, then the combos at Microcenter are by far the best deals if you are anywhre near one.   If you want 32gb ram i their bundles, you need to go 9700x or better, which was is $599. It was $499 a month ago and $449 like 6 months ago.   GPU upgrade would be a better investment if it's for gaming. You will bottleneck some but 9070xt is proabbly still going to give you around 40-50% performance increase whereas a CPU will not give you anything noticeable.",Neutral
AMD,You asked for what your bottleneck is and our answer is that it's a well balanced system.,Neutral
AMD,The CPU,Neutral
AMD,Go to microcenter and get a 9800x3d bundle. It’s $750. You could get away with a 7800x3d if you wanted to. If all you’re doing is gaming and then regular stuff on the side- you’d be fine.,Neutral
AMD,"u shouldn't mix mix ram with any cpu but it probably won't be a big deal u could just manually tune it yourself even if they are different dies to get something decent but that requires some tinkering. Could also get lucky and find out they are the same die which would be nice.  the 5700x would be somewhere between a 12400f and 12600k/kf or around the 10700k,11700k, 11900k, 10900k, 10850k.",Neutral
AMD,"10700k/11700k iinm. I have the 10900 before and it's pretty much stable with xmp set @ 3600MHz.  But if you want the best intel cpu for gaming then it's the 14600k/14700k. Those are pretty good in gaming and workload situations. The e-cores don't do much in gaming but for everything else, it's pretty good.  Remember to always update your bios to the latest microcode if you intend to buy either of those cpus.",Positive
AMD,"Given that the 12600k beats the 5800x and the 5700x is a downclocked 5800x, I would say this is the closest Intel equivalent to the 5700x.",Neutral
AMD,"Depending on what programs compare, anything from a 10600 to 12700K. AMD and Intel CPUs are very different, and only got even more different, as of 12th gen. If you can swing it, buying new, consider the 5800XT.  > it's a problem and to not mix ram sticks with a AMD CPU.  No, in that it can be a problem with Intel CPUs, too. But, a pair that works well on one may not on another. Things usually work OK, with DDR4, but mixing RAM is a bit of a lottery, if you can't verify the ICs being used.",Neutral
AMD,Don’t go intel and about the ram: you will have the chance it not working or it will run at the speed (in this case latency) of the slower ram. Xmp will be tricky because it’s already fonky.,Neutral
AMD,"How does it work if I want to tinker?   I put the hardware in the case, turn on the PC. Is there a chance of it not working there already or will it always go to the basic **without** xmp 2133 and I can tinker later?",Neutral
AMD,"How does that work?   I put the hardware in the case, turn on the PC. Is there a chance of it not working there already or will it always go to the basic no xmp 2133 and I can tinker later?",Neutral
AMD,yeah JEDEC should run fine. Different JEDEC profiles do exist but the system should default to the slower one if they are different.,Neutral
AMD,There IS a chance not working at all but probably it works with 2133,Neutral
AMD,"Thansk you. Do you think the risk is big enough that I better switch to Intel or is the different neglectible if I lower xmp speeds or even turn it off?   If I run the ram on 2133 speed instead of the 3000 it works on now, do I lose a lot of performance? I'm pairing with a 90690xt so my hardware isn't top notch to begin with, I don't know if that matters.",Negative
AMD,You know xmp is from intel and basically indicates that it works with intel cpu…even you shut down xmp,Neutral
AMD,Xmp works with amd too,Neutral
AMD,"It's good for light gaming, speaking from experience since a friend still has it. But it's not gonna run new titles very well, if at all. Almost certainly not the new RE game.  I'd like to ask what price you're seeing this at, too. There may be way better options. If you can find a 580 8 GB for nearly the same price, I'd recommend that a lot more. But maybe we can find something even better for you.",Negative
AMD,"It's a solid little GPU. However, make sure you aren't spending too much on it (I.e RX 580 prices). If you're spending more than £100 on it, i'd just get a GTX 1660 Super/Ti over it, but if it's sub 50-60, it's fine",Neutral

[Here's a video from last year showing a bunch of games and their performance on the RX 470.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU0BhOQnSPU) You won't be able to play super intensive games, but stuff like Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Resident Evil should be playable at 1080P low.",Neutral
AMD,Short Answer: No  Long Answer: Nooooo,Neutral
AMD,"Get an RX 580 8 GB, it still holds up decently for 1080p gaming, while RX 470 is really subpar, and suffers from some driver issues.",Negative
AMD,it's a MSI btw,Neutral
AMD,"If you're going for a older graphics card, look for 1660s/2060s/1080ti  Those cards will serve your needs much better and honestly rx470/570/480/580 were ripped dumped in huge quantities after the mining boom so I'd never go with that even if going for a gpu that old",Neutral
AMD,"Am currently testing an **E3-1270 v2/16GB DDR3/RX 470 8GB/Garuda Dr460nized Gaming/256GB SSD boot drive/500 GB SSD storage drive** build. The major stutters that were happening while textures load from a **1.5TB 5400 HDD** storage drive are gone. There are some micro stutters still but those are tolerable given the age of the system.  The 2022 Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (TTW) via STEAM running at 1080p LOW/MED/FSR 2.0 mix gets ***88+ FPS*** on the in-game benchmark...on ***Linux*** of all things! It's all in the settings mix. Been keeping me entertained even though it clearly is slower than my Ryzen 5 5600/B580 LE build that runs TTW at 1080p ULTRA with 95+ FPS. Even managed to undervolt the RX 470 by 243 mV to jump from 82+ FPS to the current 88+ FPS.  Another test just completed is that with a Linux distro and an AMD GPU that has no hardware ray tracing support (i.e., the RX 470 8GB), it is possible to have ***software emulation ray tracing***. Ran Little Nightmares Enhanced (STEAM) on 1080p ULTRA with HIGH Ray Tracing (the lowest available RT option) and got 10-20 FPS...unplayable...*BUT* with FSR Balanced turned on, then got 40-50 FPS that is totally playable.

So, if a RX 470 8GB can do all this with an E3-1270 v2...a 14 year-old CPU...with your 5500, the 470 certainly will be able to too.  The only caveat is don't overpay for that RX 470 8GB. Check recent Sold listing prices on eBay to gauge. Because of the success I got, I bought a new RX 580 8GB for $80.81 USD total for my E5-2697 v2 build that will be converted from Win10 to a Linux gaming distro.",Neutral
AMD,"No it is not justified. I came from rx 570 4GB and i had a really bad time with many titles to achieve stable 60fps/medium to high settings, my bare minimum with newest of games. Terrible experience, bad lows, lack of VRAM, terrible optimizations since no more support from AMD thru drivers...a mess.  Don't buy it. I bought an 9060xt 16GB triple fan and i am very very happy with performance, temperature and efficiency let alone upscaling and frame generation is dope for heavy titles. Let alone 60fps is too easy to hit, i get 120-150-200 fps on 1080p max settings in most games, taking advantage of my 144hz monitor on single player games .. so dope.",Negative

With your GPU playing on a 1440p monitor you would likely never know the difference.  Keep in mind the r5-5600, 5600T, 5600X, and 5600XT are all essentially the same thing.  Likewise the r7-5700X, 5800X, and 5800XT are all the same CPU at the core level.",Neutral

AMD,"23% price difference is not horrible, but it's a minor benefit for gaming, you'll be fine either way.",Positive
AMD,"You are, in actuality paying the 23% more for two extra cores. The 5600 is a six core, twelve thread cpu, the 5700 is eight core sixteen thread cpu. Many games don’t really use above six cores, yet. If you can afford it I would really recommend going with the 5700.

AMD,"I had a 3700x as well, and the 5700x was the best bang for buck.   Being another 65w chip I didn't need to upgrade cooling either (which you may need on a hotter chip like 5800x), just dropped that sucker in and enjoyed my ~25% single thread uplift and ~19% multi improvement.",Positive
AMD,"5600x, 5700x or 5800x3D   if in your country is available, 5600x3D",Neutral
AMD,"Do they have a Micro Center in your area or within a reasonable driving distance? They still have the AMD combo deals going on (am5, mobo, ram).",Neutral
AMD,There are rumors that AMD might bring back CPUs for the AM4 platform to combat inflate prices. I am in the same position as you and I’m waiting hoping for a return of Zen 3 chips.  https://youtu.be/5rXQr0fQbn8?si=mzf4-scVM6zUJan5  4 minute mark,Neutral
AMD,What motherboard do you have? How much RAM do you have? What GPU do you have? What resolution do you play at?  This information is important to know which CPU to recommend and avoid bottlenecking the GPU or vice versa.,Neutral
AMD,"5800X is a great upgrade if you cannot get ahold of an X3D model, as they can be quite expensive, especially outside of the States or Europe.",Positive
AMD,You won't see much of a difference. Doesn't make sense to upgrade. Do you really need it?,Negative
AMD,"Really a nice pump up, love",Positive
AMD,5800x-xt are just 5700x with double the power consumption for a maybe 10% uplift in performance?  if he has to go for 5800x at least he should take the 3d one  5700x is overclockable to 5800x performance with less of power consumption,Neutral
AMD,"I'm in Australia, so no unfortunately haha. I've had a look at some of the upgrade prices around here, and just the price of the RAM is more than getting a 5700x3d off ebay/amazon (though they're also too expensive for my budget). Plus the cost of a motherboard and processor on top of that",Negative
AMD,"That would be very cool if it comes about. I don't desperately need to upgrade now, so might be worth keeping my ear to the ground for a bit",Positive
AMD,"I hope so, right now I‘m in the same boat as OP and it‘s so painful the best would be x3d I know that and want one, but buying used at 400€+ is a no go.",Negative
AMD,"My motherboard is an x470 Gaming Plus Max, 32GB of RAM, GPU is an RTX 4060. For resolution, I usually just play on whatever the game defaults to",Neutral
AMD,"30% single core performance increase, 24% multi core performance increase. That's a decent uplift imo. Especially being able to stay on the same platform.",Positive
AMD,"Not desperately, it was more of a whim than anything. But it's a bad time to be upgrading computers, it seems, everything is so expensive",Negative
AMD,I'm in Aus too. I'd look at a 57/58/5900x CPU. Will give a decent uplift in performance.,Positive
AMD,"Honestly, you don't need to change your CPU, since a 3700x doesn't significantly bottleneck the RTX 4060 at 1080p, and none at 1440p.  You can continue as is. But if you insist on changing, a Ryzen 7 5800XT is the only one that will give you a significant improvement of up to 30 fps in single-player and 100 fps or more in competitive play. Obviously, this depends on the game.  Anything less than the 5800xt won't give you a noticeable improvement, so it would be a waste of money for 10 or 15 fps.  You should only change components when they will give you 30% or 50% more performance than what you already have, and I don't know what resolution you play at or what your monitor's refresh rate is, so if you're playing at 60 fps, the change makes even less sense.",Neutral
AMD,"You can find cheaper 5700x   but yeah, absolutely worth anyways. Its a big jump.",Positive
AMD,"Yes 100% worth it, even a 5600 or 3600. First gen Ryzen was not the best gaming cpu. The best cpu would be a 5700x3d, if you can find one",Positive
AMD,"Using a 1660 Super, going from a R5 1400bto a R5 5600 doubled my FPS in all games. I was blown away by the difference it made.",Neutral
AMD,But wouldn't b350 hold him back quite a bit?  No pcie gen4    Also op ur ram is 3200mhz but does it run stable at 3200 on first gen ryzen,Neutral
AMD,"does the B350 board support a direct upgrade from 1xxx to 5xxx ? i know that some boards needed a intermediate cpu like 3xxx that you can flash the bios that supports the 5xxx chips as the bios chips had not enough capacity to support all 4 generations (1xxx,2xxx,3xxx,5xxx) avaliable on Am4",Neutral
AMD,Yes it’s actually a very significant upgrade,Positive
AMD,"Yes, very much worth it. 1st gen Ryzen was slow. 3rd gen is not, even if it’s been superceded in recent years.",Positive
AMD,I have a hard time finding cheaper 5700x in my country for some reason. Even used ones are nowhere to be found.,Negative
AMD,x3d I could find used only and the prices are simply not worth it to me,Negative
AMD,X3D prices are insane now that its EOL and DDR5 is super expensive. I've seen them going for $400+ used.,Negative
AMD,> No pcie gen4  When not vram limited it’s usually a 0-5 fps loss depending on title,Neutral
AMD,"I dont think that the motherboard will hold it back by itself but  maybe I am wrong.  The RAM works fine, probably at a little bit lower speed but I bought the best RAM my motherboard could handle. I bought it new for 50usd thinking, RAM was always cheap, will be cheap, so it wont be a problem to upgrade in the future... how things have changed :)",Positive
AMD,"Hmm. I am not sure. I needed to upgrade bios to the latest version for my RTX5070 and 5 1600 is still working fine. Will 5700x work fine after putting it in, hopefully yes.",Neutral
AMD,How long do you think such setup will last? Is it a significant upgrade overall?,Neutral
AMD,"one 175 usd or 629 polish is fine, i bought it back when it was around 180ish$ usd and it was worth it, i have no regrets buying it at that price  also on poland based websites i cant find anything cheaper, google maybe limiting me or i cant find it",Positive
AMD,"if you have a bios allready on that supports the 5xxx chips and still works with your 1st gen chip, it should all be fine",Neutral
AMD,It was going for 161usd on a discount a week ago but I hesitated.,Neutral
AMD,"16usd is more a smaller deal, its still fine",Positive
AMD,"PSU cables seems the most likely culprit. Unreal Engine games tend to be fairly resource heavy, so if 1 of the cables isn't fully seated it may not be able to provide enough power for peak consumption, causing the crash. What wattages are your old and new PSU?",Negative
AMD,"Your list of hardware troubleshooting steps seems good. Out of curiosity, were the games installed completely fresh to the new Windows install, or were they on a separate drive/partition and rediscovered by the launchers? I’d definitely recommend trying a complete uninstall/reinstall of one that’s consistently crashing to see if that helps at all.",Positive
AMD,Old one was 650 watts (zero issues) veetro was 850 and brand new corsair is also 850. Used cables that came with their respective unit.,Neutral
AMD,I wiped and reformatted every drive. The 2 games are installed on my main os drive. Not using second or 3rd drive right now,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, then all I can think of is reseating cables etc.",Neutral
AMD,"Although Access violation errors like that are usually a ram issue, so try reseating them as well",Negative
AMD,So I ran memtest86 and everything passed the first pass.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, would helpt too if you can afford a second stick of ddr5",Positive
AMD,"Awesome way to get into am5 and the jump is pretty big, this is probably the most cost effective way of upgrading so I say go for it!",Positive
AMD,"Yes it would be a worthy upgrade.  And I believe you can swap the RAM kit for 32GB if you select ""build with it"" and then click change. Only works on desktop for me, doesn't work on mobile.  It'll add like $120 to the total price of course",Neutral
AMD,Mine location hasn’t had any in stock since the deal was announced,Neutral
AMD,You would be keeping the 3060ti? Won’t be super big upgrade as I expect ur gpu is running full usage. And I would get 32gb ram,Neutral
AMD,"the 7500x3d isn't the greatest CPU, but still a bargain at that combo price.",Neutral
AMD,"I managed to pick one up today. :) Grabbed a second stick of ram too since it was cheaper than ""normal"" (it's unbelievable that $120 is something to be happy about for a 16 GB ram stick) with the bundle. I'm hoping to get good results from this and the 5060 TI I picked up.",Positive
AMD,"The R7 7800x3D with 32GB is the sweet spot imo, it will last a long time if you can afford the upgrade. There are stories about ram being sold out until 2028.",Positive
AMD,Yeah unfortunately I just noticed it was sold out.,Negative
AMD,Mine had 8 on the website around 7am then all gone once opened,Neutral
AMD,"I am planning on getting 32gb ram, do you think the 3060ti would be bottlenecking that bad?",Negative
AMD,"7500f is not a good choice. 225f is cheaper, faster, newer and has more cores  https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6457vs5648/Intel-Core-Ultra-5-225F-vs-AMD-Ryzen-5-7500F",Positive
AMD,Solid,Neutral
AMD,Seems like a fine build.,Positive
AMD,Try to get an RDNA 5 GPU ASAP! 9060XT minimum. From this point. More and more games are going to be fundamentally incorporating ray tracing even at the software level. Games are increasingly being developed with upscaling in mind. FSR 4 and ray tracing are next generation over RDNA3 GPUs.,Positive
AMD,Thank you,Positive
AMD,"Well being blunt, you have no RAM, and without RAM it's not going to run. RAM is also pretty expensive these days unfortunately.  If this is a gaming PC you are likely better off getting a Ryzen 5000 series CPU with DDR4 RAM. If you have any budget left in that configuration, focus on getting a better GPU.",Negative
AMD,"Blunt: the build doesn't work. You are missing RAM and massively over spending on CPU while letting your GPU cry in a corner. In addition, your PSU is very questionable and poorly rated.",Neutral
AMD,"At the very least get a b580 if not a 9060xt. Never get a **50 series card, your practically paying for ewaste",Negative
AMD,Get am AM4 build instead. Like others have said you’re putting way too much money on the cpu as opposed to the GPU. If you live near a microcenter go there. If not look for a 3000-5000 series R5 cpu from AM4.   Obviously YOU NEED RAM for the pc to run. DDR4 runs on am4 as opposed to ddr5 running on am5. Ddr5 is hundreds of dollars right now due to a shortage. DDR4 is a little better priced.,Neutral
AMD,"Go am4, RAM is still expensive but not as much as ddr5. Ryzen 5600 ($130), msi b550 pro vdh ($100),16gb 3600 ddr4 ($200?)someone’s used rtx 3070 ($300),and the best power supply you can afford with what’s left of your budget($150). Power supplies can last a long time, and it’ll cost more to buy another one than it will to buy a better one now.",Neutral
AMD,https://pcpartpicker.com/list/KdHJzP and with the leftover cash get a GPU from the used marketplace. Or yk just go AM4 if you want the new GPU,Neutral
AMD,I don't see any RAM listed here.    How do you plan on getting it to work without RAM?,Neutral
AMD,Are you near a microcenter? If so they have a deal going right now for a ryzen 7500x3d 16gb ddr5 and a 850 mb for 300 bucks. Hard to beat that as a starting point,Neutral
AMD,I’ll do a build for you if you’re near a micro center.,Neutral
AMD,Huge bottleneck on your GPU. Also as others said you need ram. If you're running a 7700x I'd have at least 32gb,Neutral
AMD,"Don't get a 3050 bro they suck, atleast get a 2nd hand 3080",Neutral
AMD,"If I may offer a suggestion.  Back in the wild and wooly days of Pentium 1, computers were reletively expensive.  The strategy we used back then was to buy good high quality motherboard with onboard graphics and sound and the best processor we could afford.  And whatever hard drive we could afford after that.  And a minimum of RAM.  Of course, we could get cases really cheap back then compared to today.  Now you have a funcioning computer.  We would save up for a few months, watch the sales, and when a really good price for RAM hit the market, we would fill up with the good stuff.  Same thing, wait a while, and get a high end video card.  And, of course, a SoundBlaster card was where you wanted to end up after getting a hard drive big enough that you didn't have to uninstall a game and install another whenever you wanted to play something else.  (Seriously.)  And then leap-frog.  Keep the latest stuff, the video card, the sound card, and most likely the RAM and HDD, and do a latest-and-greatest CPU and MB, and ungrade everything else over time again.  My first PC was a Pentium 223 MMX with the then brand-new release of Win98, with onboard sound and video, a 2GB hard drive (Really!) and 8mb of RAM.  But it was expandable.  And of couse, the 2GB HDD became a secondary to the 8 GB HDD and the CD player eventually became a CD-RW, and then a DVD.  Most PC's don't have CD's anymore, or even DVD's, but I still keep my DVD-RW just in case.   Just a thought from the annals of PC history.",Neutral
AMD,"For that price, given everything going on with RAM and Storage pricing. I hate to say this, but buy a pre-built. I would double check the thermal paste on the cooler, but yeah…   Pretty solid build for $1200   https://www.microcenter.com/product/698874/powerspec-g527-gaming-pc  If you’re not by a MicroCenter, maybe try Walmart.

AMD,"I've seen used -50 cards around here go for much lower prices for the performance than -60, -70 or -80 cards do. Used, they're not a bad deal as long as you're being realistic about what you're going to do with it.  Of course, I've also seen idiots who price them as high as a -70 card of the same generation because it has ""GTX"" or ""RTX"" in the product name, so that's not a hard and fast rule. It does seem to me that -50 cards get undervalued more often than any other G/RTX model on the used market.",Negative
AMD,"If you live near a microcenter that is actually the one case I could argue going AM5 makes sense as it is hard to get CPU/motherboard/RAM under $300/$350 even on AM4. Because while being single channel sucks, saving money and buying more RAM later is fine.",Neutral

AMD,OP listen to this.  This is a much much better build.  You could up the storage too and still be under budget.,Positive
AMD,"Why the 500gb ssd? 1tb is like $100. Also I'd much rather get a PSU with a 12vhpwr connecter even if that's not a good cable, just for the upgradability. If you use more of the budget, OP could easily upgrade to a 1440p build like this. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Lsnjjn  Also I highly recommend getting 16GB DDR4 for $50-60 on FB marketplace or Ebay and a used 6800XT or 3080 Ti to save money.",Neutral

A few things you can do to save money: choose a 9060 XT (16GB) and also MC has a new CPU/Mobo/RAM kit available for $300 - check their web page.  That'll save you about $100 in total and you can throw that into a nicer monitor.  It's similar-ish to what you have but the GPU is way nicer.  I'd put as much money into the GPU as possible if I were you,  Buying the cheapest GPU with 16GB is probably your best bet here.  Any of the MC bundles will have a good enough CPU.",Neutral

AMD,"During the issues with Intel 14th Gen, ASUS released hotfixes BIOS updates as beta releases. However, this also required agreeing to terms stating the warranty was void if you accepted the “beta” update. Failing to install the hotfix would lead to eventual CPU failure.

They claim it was released as BETA to deliver the update as quick as possible; likely avoiding a number of required and lengthy QA steps.",Neutral

Notably not even necessarily generative AI, I used them for example to write a network that would remove noise from CT-scans as part of my thesis.  As for why they come with your GPU, that stuff often needs to run on a GPU and the longest time only NVIDIA had actual support with their CUDA-api. So this might be AMD informing people about them catching up; in a bit of a clumsy way to be fair.

AMD,"Afaik they don't actually include the AI bundle as in it will download that stuff only if you want it. I think the main reason for AMD doing this is simply to make their GPU more appealing to the AI crowd since right now when you want to do AI, people (including me) always say ""go with Nvidia"" which is honestly still true. I would be very happy if this push will make more AI devs not only make their AI solution work on AMD GPU but actually optimize it to run good on AMD.  I know if you don't care about AI then this will be annoying to you, but you can't deny that the demand for AI is there and AMD is trying hard to catch up to Nvidia.   I wish they would also pay attention to other productivity stuff tho, like using their GPU for rendering in Blender is still a lot slower than the spec suggested, thus there is a potential for more optimization.  Also I really want AMD to make the Vulkan version of FSR4 and just let the RDNA3 GPU run FSR4 upscaling even if it is just running the FP8 version in FP16 thus slow.

This is *not* a set of invasive, resource-consuming AI products that spy on your stuff or eat up 2/3rds of your RAM to maybe answer a question once a year.

However, I do see this as a W in some ways. You mentioned the rising cost of PC parts and how it's related to AI. This is from huge tech companies purchasing all the NAND flash inventory. Companies like OpenAI farm huge amounts of data and use legal loopholes to use people's data for training. It is quite honestly a hellscape, but what they're doing here is showing you that your AMD GPU is actually a legitimate option for running this stuff locally and not necessarily having to rely on a service like ChatGPT. They could easily just pour all their inventory into SenseMI for data centers and leave the gaming industry behind. Not only are they choosing to not do that, but are showing you that your AMD GPU is an affordable option to be able to run some of this stuff locally without having to give money to OpenAI.",Neutral

AMD,In my opinion AMD is kind of doing something against the RAM and SSD pricing situation because it makes companies like OpenAI (which is the main culprit) no money when you run your own tools locally and don't subscribe to their cloud services.

AMD,"in my opinion this is the proper way to do it, those tools allow you to run LOCAL ai, which isn't data hungry, and uses open source projects.  not only that but it's Opt In rather than opt out.  to me this is basically the same as when Nvidia was putting GeForce experience in the installer, which as a reminder isn't mandatory, but was checked by default anyway",Neutral

I get hating big AI companies like OpenAI and xAI for polluting communities, consuming copious amounts of electricity, and collecting way more personal data than they have any right to, but none of this applies to running open source models locally on your computer.  Environmentally, it isn't any more harmful than playing a demanding game, and you also have the benefits of privacy, Nothing leaves your computer.",Negative
AMD,"For people that use local AI, it also addresses one of the biggest complaints with Radeon cards. Before, you'd have to jump through so many hoops to get something like ComfyUI working (at least on Windows). You'd need to install dependencies, HIP SDKs, certain versions of Python, ZLUDA (an emulated version of CUDA) and do a bunch of command line shit just to get it working.  Because of this, people would overwhelmingly recommend buying Nvidia for AI work because it was plug and play. You downloaded it and it worked.  The point of this AI bundle is to finally bring that plug and play experience to Radeon owners.

AMD,Motion clarity is still rough though. There's bad ghosting I've seen.,Negative

AMD,Fsr 4 performance mode beats fsr 3 quality in many title with foliage at 4k.,Neutral
AMD,"I've been using FSR4 on a 7900XT via Optiscaler, and it's not so bad. Idk how well DLSS4.5 runs so I can't speak to that, but the performance dip really isn't that bad and the quality jump is insane. ""Performance"" FSR4, even on INT8, looks better than ""Quality"" FSR3 or earlier.  Because of that, I've been able to get the same or better results on all but the most demanding games. There are exceptions; Borderlands 4 saw something like a 10-15 FPS drop. But that seemed to be a BL4 problem as other demanding games (even ones on UE5, such as Oblivion Remastered) ran fine.",Positive
AMD,"Not true. 7900 XT and XTX would have no trouble using FSR 4, at least at 1440p",Neutral
AMD,all new apus come with rdna 3 and 3.5 ever the 395 max. 4060 performance.,Neutral
AMD,"No, I use mods that enable FSR 4 and it's perfectally usable in every game I got it working. The performance hit didn't bother me at all.",Positive
AMD,"Have you even looked into it, performance is wsy better than dlss4.5 on 20 and 30 series, its similar or better than dlss4.0 on 20 and 30",Positive
AMD,so it would gimp the 7900xtx?,Neutral
AMD,"Because this is simply not true  It's very much worth it, atleast in my experience, maybe on 6000 it's too much, but on 7000, or atleast a 7900xt it would definitely be a nice to have",Positive
AMD,"That’s not really true. It’s gotten better and better with more community optimisations and presumably AMD could do a lot more.  Also much like DLSS 4.5 more options is never a bad thing. I’ve seen people with a 2080 use ultra performance mode combined with preset L to get surprisingly good image quality in path trace titles. Meanwhile, I’ve seen people with something like a 3090 TI just use preset M and brute force the image quality improvements as basically a native anti-aliasing alternative.   This is why I’m so against this AMD style of thinking where they know best or Nvidia for that matter with frame generation which now could very well run on the 20 and 30 series after they removed the need for flow rate acceleration in their new model but they haven’t done that. I’m sure there are some CPU bound games that could deliver a good experience even on the 20 and 30 series cards but because Nvidia is greedy or Nvidia thinks they know best they haven’t done that.",Positive
AMD,"The penalty is when comparing to FSR3 performance, not native render. I get 42-45 fps in cyberpunk 2k/all max/rt max/pt off and just enabling quality fsr3 gives me +30ish fps. I wouldn’t care if it gave me +20fps but actually good image quality instead",Negative
AMD,"DLSS 4.5 works quite well on my 3060ti. I've been using it in Cyberpunk 2077 since they released it. Yes, it drops the performance down just a little bit, but it's not much.",Positive

AMD,I have so much respect for you for the edit. Most wouldn't even check and just double down,Positive
AMD,Respect the edit,Neutral
AMD,"DLSS4 runs just fine on older and weak RTX cards also 4.5 can be acceptable in some titles, but apparently AMD can't keep up with DLSS 4.0 quality. In terms of FrameGen even Intel has way better one.",Positive

AMD,"Ah yes, the Norton antivirus special",Neutral
AMD,The Microsoft way.,Neutral
AMD,"I actually like it. I use PyTorch for work.  Being able to use the game driver and have current version ROCm support is amazing to me.

AMD,"bro its out of context but, 96 gb ddr5 god damn",Negative
AMD,Honestly trying to setup cuda and tensorflow is such I nightmare I’d click that box immediately,Neutral
AMD,"Calling pytorch just a dependency of modern AI applications is a bit wild. PyTorch is an open-source framework for anything AI-related. It's used in academia for so much.  And yes, the bundle there bundles the newest ROCm version (7.2) which is a large stepup from ROCm <7.",Neutral
AMD,"Dude literally called the single most important machine learning framework ""just dependencies""  (Yes I am using hyperbole)",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, this is what gets me about people thinking that AMD has some ulterior motive, or that this is the work of evil big AI, or that this will eventually be forced upon users.   Out of all the AI apps listed here (not the developer tools VSCode, Python and Pytorch), all of them are freeware. 3 out of 4 of them are open source. AMD does not develop any of these apps (Amuse was sponsored, but no one's going to use that with ComfyUI available). And with the exception of Amuse, all of these originally worked on Nvidia first.  AMD does not directly benefit from people having this software on their computer in any way. All of these are for running AI locally on your own hardware. You do not pay for any cloud compute or transfer any data to AMD. They make zero money by bundling these apps for you.  So why are they doing this? It's stupid, but the point of this is to let people know that these things now work hassle free on AMD cards. One of the many things they lagged behind Nvidia in other than upscaling, ray tracing and all that was local AI.   Getting something like ComfyUI working on Nvidia was as simple as downloading it and installing it. It just worked out of the box. By comparison, getting it working on AMD was a complete pain in the ass. [They even acknowledged as such](https://youtu.be/UZHffzyyatY) in their promotional video for this.  All this was aimed to do was to let people know this is no longer the case. Was it a hamfisted, clumsy way of doing it? Totally. But this is very different from something like Microslop trying to shove in Copilot into everything.  It's opt-in, for fucks sake. My drivers automatically updated because I forgot to turn off auto update and none of these things were installed on my computer. Hell, I wouldn't have known this ""AI Bundle"" thing even existed until I saw it on reddit.",Negative
AMD,"Oh yeah. Llms are easy going, especially with Lmstudio, but Stable Diffusion is my endboss. Never got it working right.",Negative
AMD,"My gpu, a 7900 XT has 20 GB vram and I can do, what I wrote pretty well. The 7900 XTX has 24 GB vram and the 9070 XT has ""only"" 16 GB vram. Still good enough for most of the smaller models.   I have to check it again, but from memory I got around 7 to 12 tokens per second from coding models in Lmstudio.  Amd ist not as easy to setup as Nvidia, true, but then this is just an argument for the AI bundle, right?",Positive
AMD,">Basicly only 7900xtx have above 16gb vram  I mean, realistically, what consumer GeForce cards have more than 16 GB of VRAM? It's only ever been the Titan/90 class. Sure, Nvidia does have a couple generations of it available, but these were (and are) prohibitively expensive, so it's not exactly a point against AMD. When it was still available, the 7900 XT was the cheapest card that could fit gemma3-27b-qat completely into its memory with a usable context window.  >Highly ineffective and slow.  It's really not that bad. I have a 7800 XT and with Z-Image-Turbo I can generate a 1536x2048 image in under a minute. Not as fast as an Nvidia card, sure, but still pretty damn fast for an image of that resolution. Flux.2 Klein-4b edits images in under 10 seconds for me. Would an Nvidia card make it even faster? Sure, but not faster enough to say that AMD sucks for these applications.",Neutral
AMD,My 6800xt is extremely fast for my local hosted ai as long as I keep the model below 16Gb,Positive
AMD,Isn't self-hosted severely limited and kind of stuck as you will reasonably not even have half the amount of memory available compared to commercial models? Assuming that you have at best 32GB of VRAM compared to the Nvidia AI optimized cards with 80GB of VRAM. Or is there not that much different between the smaller and larger models?,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, ComfyUI already simplified the process themselves. You just select ROCm on their installer and they handle everything for you.",Neutral
AMD,I literally just bought a 5070ti because of all the BS I'd have to go through to get Comfy and a few others working on an AMD GPU. This would have been nice to have last week.,Positive

AMD,So basically your average Redditor?,Neutral
AMD,So many people don't even do a simple google search before commenting.,Negative
AMD,You jest but having ROCm PyTorch finally available for Windows is big news for some,Positive
AMD,Actually yeah this update is solid for people new to local LLMs (I run ollama via Vulkan on my windows + 9060 XT 16GB rig).  I hope they tweaked the ollama install. Not all amd  cards (like mine) can use local ollama unless the environment variables tell it to use Vulkan instead of ROCm. Vanilla ollama performance like shit otherwise as it won't touch the GPU without the env vars  Edit - apparently the installer will skip ollama install if it's already installed. The ollama build that the installer installs is preconfigured to use rocm including the libraries needed. I'll have to configure some env vars manually to take advantage of it,Positive
AMD,"God yeah  Im in computer science and absolutely hate the trend of LLMs and how its feasting on resources.  But good lord do I despise the people who will toss anything Machine Learning, or even remotely """"""""AI"""""""" into that same pot and burn it immediately. Harrassing people doing genuine research or using it actually efficiently pisses me off greatly just because they cant see the lines inbetween.",Negative

AMD,It's really strange to me how almost every reply to this post is disagreeing that it's bad with lots of upvotes and yet the post itself has 1.5k upvotes.  I guess all the people who just hate AI blindly are upvoting it without really bothering to engage in the discussion.,Negative
AMD,an ai tool to run local offline ai using your gpu as the accelerator while using free open source model...,Neutral
AMD,"This is not that. These are local llm tools. They are tools and open source softwares, not openai, claude etc... You can say these things are bad. It's worth a discussion but it's like comparing nestlè to perhaps a mid size wheat farm.",Negative

AMD,It just makes the entry to local LLMs easier. Nothing wrong with that.,Negative
AMD,"Im not a developer. I just used python for the first time the other day to make a tray icon app that tells me the last episode i opened of the show I'm watching on VLC. I always forget to make a note of the last episode i watched, so this tiny script i learned how to make is very very helpful. I'll be using python some more, just have to think of ideas.  Its really simple and just the exact thing i needed. Basically it reads VLC for file names and updates a text file with the last opened episode, and then i have a little tray icon that reads the text file and when i hover over it with my mouse, it gives me a tooltip popup ""Last Opened: The Office S05E03"". Yes, I'm watching The Office",Positive

AMD,"doesn't seem weird at all to me, those tools are meant to run local AI models, which need your GPU and some small configuration steps",Neutral
AMD,Could it be because GPUs are used in areas other than video games?,Neutral
AMD,A lot of developers working in AI use their graphics card to run models. This looks like a convenient way to get that set up without too much fiddling.,Positive

AMD,"I know Optiscaler can, but for like 99% of people it is either the built in solution or none. To make the FP8 version run in FP16 should be relatively easy for AMD and they should at least do that. If some people want more upscaling performance then they can use Optiscaler with the INT8. Of course it will be for the best if AMD actually uses the INT8 version and also keeps the model updated in parallel with the FP8. That means maintaining 2 different main models (which in each model there are optimisations for several upscaling targets) which I doubt they will do.",Neutral

AMD,Except when given that option they try it and when it does t work they blame the company and demand they make it work,Negative
AMD,Nah.  It just won't run as well as it will on RDNA4.  AMD is being dumb by trying to keep it on RDNA4 only.  Sure isn't getting them any sales and has pissed off a whole lot of people.   Its a pretty egregious unforced error by AMD execs at this point.,Negative
AMD,I can play performance mode at 1440p in cyberpunk 2077 with all settings cranked without any noticeable artifacts on DLSS 4.5.

AMD,"I'm not sure what other software you wanted to use, but for ComfyUI I've actually been using the Portable Install for ROCm for about a month now on my 7800 XT. Even before this AI Bundle, the Portable Install automatically set everything up for me. I downloaded it, ran the .bat, and was immediately able to start generating.  That's rough. I mean, if it's only been a week and you'd really appreciate the extra $150 bucks, you could probably still return it and buy a 9070 XT instead?  That said, you might want to keep your 5070 Ti, because there's still a few things on the local AI side that are still designed completely for Nvidia. Nunchaku quants don't work on AMD and the devs have stated they have no intention of getting it working for it, and one of the best S2T models out there right now, Nvidia's Canary, is unsurprisingly only able to run on Nvidia cards because it uses Nvidia's NeMo as one of its dependencies.",Neutral
AMD,"You don't need to install anything, the whole point of this is that it does it all for you.  What you might need to do is uninstall things. I switched over from ZLUDA to ROCm a little while back, and while it worked it was acting weird because I had an old version of ROCm (6.2.4 or something) installed along with a bunch of HIP SDKs from my ZLUDA installation. Uninstall those before you update and remove variables from PATH or things might be weird.   I can't remember everything I had to uninstall, but ask an AI like Gemini and it'll walk you through what needs to be done. That's what I did.",Neutral

AMD,"Almost because it’s a hack and not supported natively by AMD. still works better on many games on some cards. A lower FSR4 setting looks better than a higher FSR3 setting, and performs about similarly. That’s a big jump in visuals for not much performance hit. I’m going to run cyberpunk that way on my 7900XT since FSR4 is the next best thing compared to DLSS, and way better than FSR3.

AMD,"It's fine, I got the 7600x combo at microcenter and matched it with a 9060xt 16gb for my dad, and my nephew was using it for cyberpunk for hours at 1440p, played and looked great",Positive
AMD,Its a great entry level cpu.,Positive
AMD,"I'm rocking the same CPU, but with a 5070 Ti. I totally agree that this CPU isn't talked about enough. I'm more than happy with it.",Positive
AMD,Coming from a i5-7600k to a 9600x I think it's a damn good CPU!,Positive
AMD,"Yes, quite good. It's not good anymore only for new builds as ddr5 ram is very expensive so AM4 is way cheaper",Positive
AMD,>because nobody talks about it i  What?  Great combo btw.,Positive
AMD,"Especially in 4K, as the general workload will be heavily GPU dependent. Wife's got a 9600X and 5070 Ti at 4K no issues.",Neutral
AMD,For 1080p it’s one of the best CPU price to performance wise. And pairs well with mid range GPUs like 5060 Ti 16gb / 5070 but for 4k definitely want something stronger.,Positive
AMD,Yeah i’m using a 5060 TI 16gb with the 9600x and It gives me 120+ frames on Arc Raiders in 1080p and Balanced DLSS,Neutral
AMD,"I look at it like this. If AMD was doing a huge number of RMAs and they thought it was due to the packaging exposing the CPU to impact, etc. they would likely change the packaging. I have a feeling the retail boxing is a non-issue.",Neutral
AMD,This is the Answer! 😎  https://preview.redd.it/b9avfnd3breg1.jpeg?width=283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb6eb9b8bd15ed2c58c544cb6324109322a9fb71,Neutral
AMD,"Not ideal...  But realistically you could probably throw it at a rock and, assuming no physical defect to inhibit putting it in the socket(or pad damage), probably be okay.",Neutral
AMD,I just find it amusingly contradicting when the store wanted me to package the damaged CPU in 2inches of padding when sending it. And they just yeet the thing in a box with nothing and its good to go in their opinion.,Negative
AMD,Edit: I have a ryzen 7 3700x not a 5700x,Neutral
AMD,Very nice upgrade. It does look like it's just one ram stick.,Positive
AMD,I was about to say I think raw load the 5700X is faster real world it’s blow for blow. But if you have 3700X yeah this is an upgrade. I’ve seen better deals lately but if it’s all you can access yeah it’s okay.,Positive

AMD,"It's obviously better than a 7800x3d, but I'm wondering do you see any noticable difference? Like not numbers but exeperience-wise?",Neutral
AMD,Benchmarks Please!,Neutral
AMD,Same TSMC 4nm node as 9800x3d with 7.7% faster boost clock so doesn't seem like a significant upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"Honestly it is disappointing. It is not any faster than my stock 9800X3D at 5.2GHz in MH wilds benchmark with an RTX 5090 and it runs way hotter. Frequencies not even hitting 5.6GHz, hovering around 5.3-5.5GHz stock with 6000MT/s CL26 2000FCLK 3000UCLK. Adding a -10CO makes it go to 5.45-5.58GHz but I get BSODs on desktop.

AMD,how big is the difference with 7800X3D ?,Neutral
AMD,So this is the 14900k.. i mean the 9850x3d.  Let see how long it last,Neutral
AMD,They usually add support for new cpus beforehand,Neutral
AMD,it managed to boot with the latest msi bios (from Dec),Neutral
AMD,"The reason we knew the CPU existed at all before it was announced, is because people pull apart BIOS updates every time there's a change, and that's how they found support for this CPU.",Neutral

AMD,What is the issue? Genuinely curious.,Neutral
AMD,whats the fps gains by doing this from a 5.6ghz stock clock? Its worth all the try & error?,Neutral
AMD,It's a 9800x3d that's a tiny bit better. Still the same architecture just a tiny bit more mhz boost,Positive
AMD,klar ;),Neutral
AMD,when i find time,Neutral
AMD,"ich bin dran, aber ich habe keine zeit",Neutral
AMD,the website where I bought it doesnt list it anymore.  So it must have been a mistake :D,Neutral

AMD,Thx for reassuring me on my 7900x,Neutral
AMD,Or paradox games. Maybe you can play large map Stellaris till 2400,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think resolution is going to play such a major role in cpu usage. They actually lower the resolution to 1080p to compare cpu's to remove the gpu bottleneck. Very game dependent ofc.  I believe this cpu is made for the no-compromise setup, stellar at gaming ánd productivity, that last is where it will leave the 7800x3d in the dust",Neutral
AMD,But how do you know!?!,Neutral
AMD,"Yo. If you enable a 200 boost clock override in the bios and play a game that is receptive to single thread boost like Hogwarts Legacy, does it boost up to 5.8GHz",Neutral
AMD,danke aber scho guet ganz zfride mit mit 9800,Neutral
AMD,they die early.,Neutral
AMD,"Dann schick ihn mir, ich teste ihn",Neutral
AMD,eh,Neutral

AMD,Frying from what exactly? Just upgraded to an AM4 5700x3d so just curious.   I did upgrade my BIOS well in advance though.,Neutral
AMD,"Wrong. Same 96MB L3 + 8MB L2.  Check with official sources or news sites, not AI overviews",Negative
AMD,Are you confusing this with the 9950X3D that is coming sometime later this year?,Neutral
AMD,I’am getting similiar frames with 7800x3d,Neutral

AMD,I can either my 9800x3D 😃,Neutral
AMD,"Same architecture, same cache, just faster clock",Neutral
AMD,Bigger number = faster,Neutral
AMD,"I also had this happen to me, and with a +200MHz override with didn't move past 5.6GHz, I assume because the bios doesn't technically support it yet (X870E Apex), external clock gen does work though, and I got mine to around 5.9GHz with it.",Neutral
AMD,"Isn't that because of motherboards, or is it confirmed a CPU issue?",Neutral
AMD,It was the AM5. Release of 7000 series. I dont remember 5000 series frying.  https://preview.redd.it/wxeko72k45fg1.jpeg?width=576&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=379f6fc9eff44e7d10d6daced45b0b8f520de0df  Dark times,Neutral
AMD,"Certain motherboards from certain manufacturers only. They have not had a great time with the 800 series BIOSes overall imo.  I had an x870 tomahawk that had beta labels for all bios versions for months after release. They eventually just removed the beta entirely, but it feels like little has changed. So many of these boards have memory compatibility problems that go away with a motherboard swap, for instance.",Negative
AMD,Certain motherboards like Gigabyte,Neutral

AMD,I was getting the same score with my 9800x3d. I think we'll need to wait for a BIOS-update.,Neutral
AMD,tbf those CS2 benchmarks are pretty useless.,Negative
AMD,It was certain motherboard software making it run to hot and toasting it. There was a bios update to fix it.,Negative
AMD,We don't know,Neutral
AMD,"they still haven't admitted to which is really the culprit but regardless, them cpus getting toast quick",Neutral
AMD,Cause the main selling point is the dual 3dvcache in both CCD? 9975X3D suggests its just a 9900x3d with better clock boost,Neutral
AMD,"Anything above x950 is reserved for Threadripper (Threadripper PRO is effectively +5, 9945WX, 9955WX, etc up to 9995WX)  Also would conflict with the 32 core PRO 9975WX",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, sorry typo.",Neutral
AMD,Fair. share an update when it’s post bios update,Neutral
AMD,"I see you have identical setup to mine, what is your benchmark result? Mine avg 930, p1 320",Neutral
AMD,"So far, haven't seen any cases with Gigabyte motherboards. Obviously, that's not a guarantee, but it seems like ASRock and Asus have been the main culprits.",Negative
AMD,"thats true, but 75 > 50, so just thought so.   Your statement does make sense tho.   Now that i think of it, an OCed 9900X3D whould be a 9925X3D?",Neutral
AMD,"oh, yeah I forgot about that...   also congrats of being part of the ThinkPad represent.   Im joinig soon as well!",Positive
AMD,"And especially they're software, too much power, too much heat.",Negative
AMD,yes so far have only seen Asrock and Asus as well.,Neutral
AMD,"Its honestly an AMD problem.  Asrock/Asus just has more aggressive default overclocks in the bios when you turn it on compared to other companies, however all of their overclocks are within the spec sheet of AMD.  Its AMD's bad batch vs an aggressive overclock.",Negative
AMD,what about 9952X3D? or is it too convoluted/feels too close to 9950X3D?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah it's kinda odd lol, but again HEDT is kinda dead. Wish they could follow something closer to the Epycs in naming convention  ThinkPads are great machines. They'll last you a long time.",Negative
AMD,"Nothing to do with OC. It is all about voltages and Asrock and ASUS (but especially ASUS) pump around unnecessary high voltages and some more sensitive chips might not enjoy it and die. But as i keep saying, the incidence of dying chips is pretty low. I built over 100 systems with 7800X3D and 9800XD combined and i am yet to receive a return due to dead CPU.",Negative
AMD,... What about 9955X3D?,Neutral
AMD,higher voltage gives more headroom for a stable oc.  Its overclock.,Neutral
AMD,"I just hope AMD releases a 9900X3D, but with 3D V-cache in both CCDs",Neutral
AMD,"But you need to apply the OC manually, the board does not automatically OC the CPU. The increased voltage should not be applied from the factory.",Neutral
AMD,What next gen path tracing does that game use? 😅   And why is it in Lego game? 😅,Neutral
AMD,">Next year you prolly gonna need a 4080 to play a remaster or snake or some like that  But look at it this way: soon, your GPU will no longer appear in the system requirements!",Neutral

AMD,Why optimize when you can just vibe-code?,Neutral

AMD,You can usually run games at quite a bit under minimum requirements. It's not something i'd worry about.,Neutral
AMD,"I will do you one better.  In the future, games will require that your GPU supports frame generation.",Neutral
AMD,This requirement is most likely with raytracing turned on. Turning it on results in these high requirements for even the most basic looking games.,Neutral
AMD,can‘t even blame people with not enough spare money switching to console at this point.,Negative
AMD,Not really. My old GPU wasn't even stated in minimum system requirements. Still I could play new games for like another 7 years.,Neutral

AMD,"I replaced my 5700XT recently, glad I did. Let's hope the replacement lasts.",Positive
AMD,Imagine not even making minimum requirement list,Negative
AMD,"Im not saying this is good, just stating the potential reasons. The game uses UE5, which is already heavy out the gate, and those minimum specs line up with the PS5 and XSX.   So, given that the XSS is a thing lower than minimum, it will be viable for 30 fps at 1080p. I'd imagine.   Either the consoles are 1080p@60, and they're just using that as PC min spec, or they just chucked the equivalents as min spec even if they aren't the minimum to run it.",Neutral

AMD,"I never see my specs recommended now im worried that I bought bad parts =( why wont any game recommend my system specs?  /s  Fr though, the recommended specs never make sense. They never give a target or configuration for the minimum or recommended, so it ends up being meaningless. I always thought recommended specs should be controlled like nutritional facts on food are.  For example:  Cyberpunk 2077  Minimum (720p, 30fps, lowest settings, Fsr 3.1 performance) GTX 1030 Xxx Xxxxx Xxxx  Recommended (4k, 240fps, maximum settings, DLSS 4.5 performance, FG 2x, pathtracing enabled) RTX 5080 Xxx Xxx Xxxx",Negative

AMD,"It's a nearly 8-year-old GPU. The last Lego Batman game (2014) also had 8-year-old GPUs as its minimum specs (The NVIDIA 7600GS and ATI Radeon 1950, both released in 2006).   The recommended specs are slightly more generous than the last Lego Batman game: recommended was 4 to 5-year-old GPU's (GTX 480 and Radeon 5850), while the 3080 is nearly 6 years old.   You being uncomfortable with the passage of time has nothing to do with optimization. It's been more than a decade since the last game. Graphics improve. Not just the actual effects, but also the amount of stuff that can be rendered at once in a map.",Neutral
AMD,another unoptimized slop,Neutral
AMD,"I have the explanation.  You know how everyone was begging for a return of AA games, right? Everyone was fed up of only AAAs with inflated budgets and indies? People wanted mid-budget ""AA"" games more often?   That's where Unreal Engine 5 comes in. The Monkey's Paw curls a finger.   It allows teams to make games much more quickly, and gives lower budget games the opportunity to have a much greater scope both in terms of graphics and content (e.g. Clair Obscur Expedition 33). Also just because it's Lego doesn't mean it's not going to look gorgeous. If this has Lumen, this is going to look better than Arkham Knight in terms of lighting.   But UE5 is notoriously tougher to run. That's why they don't want to underbelly how intensive the game is. Odds are, it should run fine on a lower end card. But they don't want to be complained at if it doesn't.",Neutral
AMD,NOOOOOOOO,Neutral
AMD,Minimum 3080 wow is it crysis,Neutral
AMD,The 3080 is 6 years old and the equivalent of a 5060 Ti which is a current gen mid range GPU. For such a card to appear in the recommended requirements is very reasonable if you ask me,Neutral
AMD,With requirements like that I better feel like I'm in Legoland watching a moving diorama,Neutral
AMD,Cant remember if it was in the Skywalker Saga Lego game but that shit looked amazing for it being Lego.,Positive
AMD,cant be rt or pt judging by how they put 3080 and 6800xt which are no where near comparable in that.  the game is just that fucking horridly made it seems...,Negative
AMD,But it will be *under* the system requirements…,Neutral
AMD,His won't but then mine will :(,Neutral

AMD,"Or when a graphics card started to appear in required specs.   Or when EverQuest released an expansion with a graphics upgrade, that recommended 256 RAM.

AMD,"To be fair Oblivion had a bunch of seriously stupid things going on, like massive texture files for random little prop rocks and the like. That sort of thing is very sloppy and it's not the kind of optimisation that costs anything to do. Bethesda's reputation isn't unearned.",Negative
AMD,For a bit of context on this. I had a 2 year old ATI X800 XT that couldn't run Oblivion properly. Todays equivalent would be a 4090 being only able to run a game on potato settings.,Negative

AMD,8 year old GPUs now are much closer to modern GPUs than 8 year old GPUs were 8 years ago.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah no, this is a bad optimisation, a Lego game should run on a toaster. This is UE5 doing what it does best",Negative
AMD,"The problem is that how many factors of 2x power increase GPUs launched in that time, and also look at the CPU minimum spec which is really high compared to the old one. The older one could run on really old CPUs. The new one needs something released relatively recently. Not that this is an unfair ask but it's still high as a minimum.",Negative
AMD,"This a terrible comparison in so many ways. Much akin to people comparing gpu/cpu prices in the 00s to today.   Look, I don't expect the gtx 1080 to be running this game at ultra, but I kinda thought stuff like it would at least reach minimum requirements.    RTX 3080 recommended is crazy.

AMD,"> We truly need to call bad craftmanship out more.  People really want 'Indy' or 'AA' games while demanding a degree of technical excellence that even most AAA productions can't afford...  E33 made an excellent compromise to deliver on its aesthetic.  You can't do this on the same budget with a custom or older engine, or at the very least take a huge risk that it just won't work out.  It takes much bigger studios to maintainwell optimised engines with modern feature sets that are suitable for general game development, like id with its id tech engine or Ubisoft's Anvil engine.",Negative
AMD,"Comparing a 2015 game to a 2025 game is kind of weird man idk.     Clair obscure runs decently on modern hardware, I've seen people with budget rtx4050 laptops running it.",Negative
AMD,"In which sense does Clair Obscur look like it should scale down nicely? It features all the standard photorealistic graphics and characters you'd expect from a high-end 2025 release, with a large amount of natural environments. I would expect it to scale down as well as, say, MGS Delta.",Neutral
AMD,RT isn't required in 99.9%+ of available games. I'll survive without the remainder. Those devs are choosing to make their games exclusive to a small portion of the market.,Neutral

AMD,"My kid's 2070 is *outraged*, *outraged, I tell you* but the kid just drops to medium or uses DLSS and he's happy.  Probably throw a 9060XT at him later this year.",Negative
AMD,"I remember buying Command and Conquer Generals only to find that I couldn't run it on my still fairly new PC. It often only took around 2-3 years for hardware to start becoming seriously obsolete.  Generals released in 2003 and required a DirectX 8.1-capable GPU with at least 32 MB VRAM. This ment it needed an Radeon 8500 or GeForce 4 from late 2001/early 2002. Radeon 7000 and GeForce 3 GPUs from 2001 were already outdated.  Those GPUs released at $299 MSRP. Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $550 today. So depending on how you want to compare prices, that's roughly on par with requiring an RTX 4060 or RTX 4070 Super for a game released in 2025.  The fact that people now believe that games requiring 7 year old hardware is a sign of declining optimisation is kind of hilarious.",Negative
AMD,"Oh heck, don't remind me about Evercrack. I was on Windows 2000 at the time with 512 MB, so didn't see that particular issue!",Negative
AMD,I've got the original big box PC version of Everquest pre expansion and the list of recommended GPUs on the back is absolutely wild. Shit you've never heard of. Diamonds and Orchids and Matroxx this that and whatever.,Positive
AMD,"dudes who be yappin about ""games aren't optimized anymore!"" don't know shit about ""unoptimized"" games. GPUs from 3+ years ago are still completely viable today but back then a GPU that's a year old would barely be able to play anything new",Negative
AMD,"I was running a Radeon 9700 when Oblivion dropped, bought it in late 2002. It was the king of the hill, I had it overclocked slightly over 9700 Pro spec.  Oblivion *killed it*. Even on ""Medium"". Even at 1024x768. FPS was below 20 at all times and dropped into single figures when refraction shaders were used.  That'd be like an AAA game today running badly on an RTX 4080 or 4090 from 2022.",Positive
AMD,Gpu improvements have heavily stagnated. The 3080 is still stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and even trails the 4070 from last gen.,Neutral
AMD,you couldnt play games maxed out on $500 graphics cards even in 2005 without framerate dips.  as for now. a $500 5060ti 16gb running dlss 4.5 at balanced 1440p looks good and hits 60+fps.,Neutral
AMD,"It's a LEGO game now set in a larger open world and the visuals absolutely look more detailed than the last Star Wars LEGO game, which was set in smaller linear environments. Open world games just take more to render then closed environments do.   Like, I dunno what else to tell you. The 3080 is almost six years old. It's aging and it's perfectly natural that older GPUs move down into the ""recommended"" spectrum.",Positive
AMD,Thank u i was panicking. Still not great,Negative
AMD,"tbh for real, a lego game shouldn't be demanding this much lol. ue5's wid for this",Negative
AMD,What would you say is closest to a 3080ti?,Neutral
AMD,The 4070 super is about the same,Neutral
AMD,"This isn't something subjective, it's verifiable. According to TPU, the 5060 Ti is only 11% slower while the 5070 is 15% faster.   The requirements talk about the 10gb variant so that's the one I'm considering.   Iceberg Tech also made a video comparing the 3080 12gb and the 5060 Ti and they seemed to be close, so the 10gb variant would be closer.   I'm sure there are more benchmarks you can lookup to verify the performance of the cards and reevaluate your understanding based on the results",Neutral
AMD,thought you were talkin about the Forza Horizon 4 expansion for a sec,Neutral
AMD,Playing Horizon with my son right now and it looks amazing.,Positive
AMD,"Me, personally, have a much better time with ue5 games than I did on the 4070.  Less stuttery",Positive
AMD,UE5 is bad on all cards,Negative
AMD,Arena Breakout Infinite is UE5. It runs in 3440x1440 at over 200fps on my 7900XTX. It's buttery smooth so to say.   UE5 runs fine on AMD cards.,Positive
AMD,"Seriously. When folks do these comparisons of older games vs. newer games, it's always games that at the time they released were technical achievements from some of the biggest studios pushing the boundaries of what was possible at the time.   That often had not only outsized budgets, but development timelines relative to what a smaller team can afford.  It's like uh, yeah, the game looks good because they put an immense amount of time and labor into bespoke assets and toolkits to achieve a specific aesthetic within the boundaries of that period's hardware. (and oftentimes not even within those boundaries, but pushing beyond them like Arkham Knight)",Neutral
AMD,Truth. I had no issues when I had a GTX 1080 last year.,Positive
AMD,The fact you can play the majority of modern games on 10 year old hardware seems to say the opposite of the point you're making.,Negative
AMD,Yeah but you need RTX and more CUDA cores to get all the best AI copilot features,Neutral
AMD,Big part of it as well. Everything is UE5 slop nowadays.,Negative

AMD,"I played it on a 6800xt 1440p no upscaling and it ran great, so you missed out.",Positive
AMD,"RT capable cards have existed for eight years, if your PC rig doesn't have one it might be time for an upgrade ngl",Neutral
AMD,the 9060xt is pretty similar speed as it lacks dlss and fsr3 looks bad (unless the game supports fsr4). 9070 or 5070 are upgrades though,Negative
AMD,"And before Steam and indie games really took off we had a period of publishers dismissing all PC gamers as pirates. That era was full of just *atrocious* ports from consoles, if the publishers even bothered at all.    It was pretty much just Valve and Blizzard holding the PC flag for a while, and Bioware was at least good about adapting their UIs for PC (tactical mode in DAO, for example).",Negative
AMD,"I had ME at the time, and after adding ram to my system, I was soft locking about every 30-45 min.",Neutral
AMD,"Not to mention that a lot of the stutters of the Oblivion remaster are not because of UE5, but because the original Oblivion code still stutters on hardware from over 15 years later.  Asset streaming in open worlds is a hard problem. We live in a blessed time to treat the occasional shader compilation stutter in UE5 games a as a major issue.",Negative
AMD,I had a vanilla GeForce 6800 which I was able to unmask some extra pixel pipelines for extra performance. Not sure if I ever played Oblivion on that though because I played it a couple years after release. I might've played it with my next build with the GeForce 9800 gt.,Neutral
AMD,It doesn’t matter how old the 3080 is. It’s not a weak gpu by any means. It’s like 10% stronger than the 5060ti 16gb and only slightly trails the 4070 for comparison.,Positive
AMD,Eh I blame developers just as much,Negative
AMD,"12gb 3080 and 3080ti are essentially the same performance, so the closest equivalent would be a base 4070 and 4070 super or 5070",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah there are a lot more advantages to the 3080(like its near 2x bus), and there are 2 variants of the 5060ti... don't know ""iceberg tech""... so wont speak to that.  When looking at either. We see that when in RT, the 3080 just smacks the crap out of the 5060ti 8Gb, and makes the 5060ti 16GB do a very good impression of the french. Only winning when it can leverage the 16GB Vram buffer, which is predominantly 4k, which is not a great res for that GPU anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"Tech power up isn’t accurate down to the perctanges like that, it’s more of a rough idea on where the perf of a card stacks up.   In real world benchmarks and game testing at 1440p/4K the 3080 is much closer to the 5070.   You even said that the 3080ti is closest to the 4070 super, which is correct. The 12gb 3080 is essentially the same thing as a 3080ti in perf, and a 4070 super is around 5070 perf too, so you basically agree with me already.",Neutral
AMD,haha. Lego Horizon Adventures to fully clarify!,Positive
AMD,"Probably able to just brute force it a bit more, I found I had a better time when I went with the x3d chip from my 12th gen i5. The stutters hit less frequently recovered much faster than the gpu upgrade",Positive
AMD,bad developers are bad on all cards* ftfy,Negative
AMD,I mean 7900 XTX is still tied for like 8th best amongst non-commercial cards.  Its kind of a beast.,Positive
AMD,"There are definitely examples of ue5 that run fine on amd cards, but there are a lot that don’t.",Neutral
AMD,Worse than a game at max settings? Well yeah. A game from 2014 at lowest also looked worse than a maxed out 2004 game. Maxed out 1440p half life 2 vs lowest settings 720p shadow of Mordor (which was considered a good looking game on release…not so much later). Half life 2 clears.  It’s been like that for a very long time. Basically ever since graphics settings.,Negative
AMD,I think we're saying the same thing? Only a small number of recent games require RT.,Neutral
AMD,"And the physical hardware was so low quality.  GPU didn't even need a 12VHWPR connector to frequently fail within 2-3 years, because capacitors, coolers, PSUs, and the general build quality were so bad. [This thing was a $299 card in 2002](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce4-ti-4400.c180), and it's not like high-end cards were built much better. Even on a purely physical level, it's awesome how much better built a [modern equivalent like the 5060 is.](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060.c4219)  I lost 2 GPUs to those dreaded flickering polygons (afaik indicating that some memory cell or data channel had broken) just in the 3-4 or so years I was playing World of Warcraft.  Not to mention the buzzing audio because most cables and speakers broke easily. I had to weigh down the cable of my speakers to make up for a partial cable break constantly, and had buzzy sound every summer when temperatures went up.",Negative
AMD,Whoever said it's *weak*? It's now a mid-range GPU. It is *literally the recommended GPU* for this game.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you for the insight 🤝,Positive
AMD,Is HUB a big enough channel for ya? Their review puts the the 5060 Ti 11.5% behind the 3080 12gb at 1440p so within 10% of a 3080 10gb. I would not call that a smacking.   I'm not saying that the 5060 Ti is a good card or that the 3080 10gb is bad. All the comparisons I'm saying indicate that they're reasonably close to each other and that's about it,Neutral
AMD,"The post specifically mentions the 10gb variant of the 3080 though. HUB's 5060 Ti puts it 10% slower than a 4070/3080 12gb at 1440p as well, and the 10gb variant is a few percent slower. Am I missing something?  https://preview.redd.it/pvqh1o7aoleg1.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed5bda7f6f8891119c5126bc371b1930bca8bf04",Neutral

AMD,"Oh yeh it usually runs bad, but this is Id's engine which runs amazing on amd cards generally. They did black magic to get it running smoothly. Obviously I couldn't use the path tracing mode but who cares.",Positive
AMD,"That's funny, because of course both Indiana Jones and Doom TDA at max settings run *much* better on your GPU than Control does. Because they have 'forced RT' so the games are actually built to *properly utilize* it, unlike Control which has the nice non-forced RT everyone loves - because it's bolted onto the existing engine and runs like crap. Just like *every* game that has RT bolted on runs like crap when it's enabled.",Positive
AMD,"I had one of the earlier fan cooled GPUs, and it had the bearing in the fan fail. It rattled for a bit, then the card died.   I remember all the issues with audio drivers, and it being generally recommended to have a separate sound card to get better stability for games",Negative
AMD,What I meant was the guy I was replying to says it’s perfectly natural for a 6 year old gpu to be seen in the recommended. Kinda insinuating that the 3080 is an older less powerful card that should be relegated to this status. Despite it being stronger than the less than a year old 5060ti,Neutral
AMD,"Again, what 5060ti...  You used a source. I used the exact same source. When you actually dive into the specific results, the ""12%"" average. Turns out its a lot more than 12% but occasionally the 3080 didn't run a vram parasite. You just have to open up the techpowerup results to see the details.",Neutral
AMD,Where my bro the 3070 ti? He falls right above the 7700 XT in 1080p.,Neutral
AMD,9800s only recently came out and honestly even the 5800x3d is still a premium chip. You wouldn’t be putting yourself in a bad position if you grabbed any x3d chip,Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but also it *is* an older less powerful card. It's simply relegated from a flagship status to midrange - while 5060Ti although more recent was of course midrange to begin with.",Neutral
AMD,You can't just grab a CPU and call it a day. Moving from LGA 1700 to AM4 would be monumentally stupid. He can already upgrade to CPUs equal to the 5800X3D on the existing platform.,Negative
AMD,"Of course he can, I was just on the same train of thought of I upgraded to an x3d chip.",Neutral
AMD,You upgraded to AM5 which makes sense. The 5800X3D isn't an upgrade over the best Intel CPUs.,Neutral
AMD,"If it works, don't mess with settings in the bios.  Get an anti-sag bracket to support the GPU.  Don't worry about the cables and add one back exhaust fan, bottom fans are not really necessary.",Neutral
AMD,"Will do, thanks for the heads up!",Positive
AMD,"1) You can't buy 5700X3D new anymore, and the used ones are priced horribly imo. Unless you could get a good deal, I personally like the 5700X.    2) 9060 XT has a 8 GB and a 16 GB version. Get the 16, and XFX makes a white version. Triple fans too.",Neutral
AMD,"Those parts seem fine to me. You should put those parts into [pcpartpicker.com](http://pcpartpicker.com) to check the compatibility. A white GPU is fine, but you should expect it to be more expensive than a black one. They usually are. Lastly, it's important to remember that your PC will always have a bottleneck regardless of what parts you put inside it. That's just how computers work. What matters is what's creating the bottleneck. Ideally you want the GPU to be creating the bottleneck. As long as you're not pairing a high-end GPU with a low-end CPU then you should be fine in that regard.",Neutral
AMD,Would this work and don’t mind the BiOs I can upgrade anytime. [pc part picker list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/BkxRNz),Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, that should work. Something worth noting though, you have picked a 750w power supply which is more than what you need unless you care about future proofing the build. PCPartPicker will tell you the estimated wattage of your build. You can pick your PSU based on that.",Neutral
AMD,I have an extra 200 watts which should be good for this build if I don’t overclock and if needed I can ge a new psi,Positive
AMD,1440,Neutral
AMD,1440p for more future proofing. I even aim for light 4K so it will be solid for 1440p and 4K depending on the game.,Positive
AMD,1440p. your eyes will thank you.,Positive
AMD,I've thought about it but have a 9900X3D & 7800X3D white build. I do have a lonely B850 & spare ram. But I also enjoy using more than 8 cores smacking the world boss etc. I think it would be worth for AM4 X3Ders if they have ram.,Positive
AMD,"I saw Micro Center had a 9800X3D, B650E, 32gb DDR5 6000 bundle for $749. Honestly a steal.",Neutral
AMD,"The 2 builds are very solid.  However, the Intel one has more performance for 1440p games and multitasking.  But if you want something ESTRICTLY for gaming, then the AMD one can let you upgrade to a R7 9800X3D in the future.",Positive

AMD,"When will AMD or Microsoft (whoever is at fault) fix the completely random driver timeouts caused by MPO? Whenever anything interacts with MPOs (game going fullscreen, alt tabbing out of a fullscreen game, dragging a window over a fullscreen game) there is a 15% chance that I will get a 2 second black screen -> driver timeout and a 5% chance the pc just freezes/reboots on its own  This used to happen back in Windows 10 2 years ago too, turned off MPO and it fixed it for 2 years, but then after I updated to Windows 11 a few months ago it started happening again. Even switched from a 6700xt to a 9070xt and it still happens.   Turning off MPO again fixes it but many programs nowadays rely on MPOs (see my [post about discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1nwg7ny/bug_megathread_vol_11_october_november/nr2nqht) where if you stream a game without MPOs it will force the game into `Composed: Flip`), so I can't really use that trick anymore.

I heard (and confirm it works) opening command prompt as admin, typing `winget update -all` fixes this (reboot required), and it is, then after few days driver timeouts started again, on same driver version. So what changed? Windows update have changed. Same day that timeouts started, WU installed update. Keep in mind i am on WINDOWS 10, which got opinion of being stable. I guess quality of W11 updates have spreaded into Windows 10 ESU updates.  What next? Well, increasing voltage of my UV have helped, but now i am left at just -15mv, when -40 was initially stable. Crashes (driver timeouts) started on non demanding titles, like Gates of Hell Ostfront, in totally random moments.   I'll see how the new driver will perform, but with Fedora on dual boot, i'm starting to thing about complete block of windows update at this point. What this system is becoming?

AMD,"TLDR: me too, don't know why, at least now I see I am not the only one  Edit: I also disabled MPO as one of my last changes, and that might have helped the most.  System: Intel i5 12400, 32GB ddr4 ram, 1000W psu, Asus TUF RX 9070. Nothing overclocked. Default Adrenaline settings. Main display: 1920x1080@240hz Second display: 2560x1440@60hz  I've had this issue since I first installed my rx 9070. It's been driving me crazy, being new to AMD after a long time made me think it was just me. I never had this happen before on my system, so when the only change was replacing my gtx 1060, it didn't make sense. Went through it all, replaced the PSU, clean windows installs, new and old driver reinstalls, stress testing my system(showed no issues), changing bios settings etc. Even reseated RAM and GPU, replugged cables, flipped bios on GPU. Sent multiple bug reports through adrenaline software with all data I could find.  I use Firefox and it wouldn't happen so often, but it was still frustrating when it did, so I swapped to Edge. Thought it was just a Firefox problem because it seemed like it wasn't going to timeout, until it did. Tried Chrome, happened on my first attempt. Back to Firefox now and after a recent update, v147, it looks to be stable. It could have been windows updates being helpful, though there was no description of this problem in the change logs. This occurred from driver 25.9.1 to 25.12.1. Haven't tried Chrome and Edge again since I don't use them normally, but I did it at the time to try and find a solution.  I opened a bug report on Firefox: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1996433)  After all of this, I think it is not a browser specific issue, though at first I thought it was. But I do think that for whatever reason, hardware accelerated programmes displaying media as it is drawn in or interacted with, on a second display, have a chance to cause a driver timeout. What made this clear was when I simply scrolled in Discord one time and it timed out, as it is also hardware accelerated. At this point I still try to reproduce it because it's hard to believe it's fixed, but lately it seems to be better, for now...",Neutral
AMD,I thought it was because I'm using Brave and only happening to me...,Neutral
AMD,"Bro I doubt this is a general issue, if you're talking about Microsoft Edge, the preinstalled browser on every single Windows installation, that would be a pretty famous and known issue :|",Negative
AMD,I've never had that problem with any AMD GPU. Huh.,Neutral
AMD,Dude I thought I was going crazy,Negative
AMD,"You know what? I've been having the same problem. Not with Chromium apps per-se, as I use Firefox, but I've had a hanging problem happening for the last few months which happens at pure random. Only when playing / scrubbing through video in Firefox or VLC. The hang usually happens very quickly after starting playback. I've also crashed it with Vegas Pro, which also uses the Media Engine.  But I can run video for hours, or game + play video for hours, and have absolutely no timeout. But if I lock and unlock my PC, I might get a hang 1/50 times. Or if I spend a half hour or so scrubbing through video, which is heavily stop and go. Eventually I'll crash it.  There is also a REALLY annoying VRAM memory leak I've been trying to track down. I caught Discord once using over 8GB of VRAM. It's another one of those random and intermittent things which shows up, but doesn't correspond with any GPU usage. Only uptime.  I can't crash the card with only games, or with any stress test though. Even tried OCCT with variable and fixed loads. No crash. No errors. Even tried both of the BIOSs, which were both stable for a good two years, with my card.  EDIT: Hopefully not just speaking too soon, but I remembered that my card has a problem with one of the DisplayPort outputs. If I connect just the right monitor to it, the port drives the monitor just fine, BUT... the GPU will become very unstable for whatever reason. Usually coincides with the HDMI display dropping out randomly. The other two DisplayPort ports work just fine! Might just be a board problem with the 7900XTX I have as I've heard of other reports of this happening on cards with Type C ports, with the Type C port in particular being broken.",Negative
AMD,"This has been happening to me since May on my 7900XTX. I've done driver rollbacks, Windows 11 reinstalls, RMA, everything set to default.. nothing worked.  I've narrowed it down to anything that uses hardware video encoding/decoding. It's definitely video-related.    In Firefox, I've changed **media.hardware-video-decoding.enabled** to False and I can watch videos normally without crashes.  Discord and anything that auto-plays videos will sometimes TDR and crash my whole system.",Negative

AMD,Yes it actually happens quite often for me and requires a manual launch or a complete restart,Neutral
AMD,Windows sometimes rips out the driver with their updates and replaces it with an internal driver. There was a big one recently so you could have got caught in that.

AMD,"I've seen this too (it's unbearable in the clouded forest) but I don't believe AMD can fix it as it is most likely an FSR implementation issue. Ubisoft will have to fix this. The issue is not seen in other games and is highly scene dependent even in AFOP which points to instability in the game's g buffer, not an upscaler defect. If there's anything wrong with the motion vectors, depth, reactive masks, transparency masks, or disocclusion data that the game feeds into fsr, then the upscaler output will be affected.",Negative
AMD,"Given that Avatar runs reasonably enough on consoles already and that the weakest FSR4 capable GPU is a 9060XT(which is about as powerful as a PS5 Pro), can you not just turn off FSR4?  Might take an image quality hit, but that's very different from being 'unplayable'.",Neutral
AMD,"Running Windows 11 and never had any issues with my 6950XT. I bought my 9070XT on day one and had to disable MPO for my PC to function even slightly normal.

AMD,Still good?,Positive
AMD,It's local llm,Neutral
AMD,It's for running AI models on your own hardware. like stable diffusion.  You can also subselect the parts you want. But if models are included then each one can be multiple gig's.,Neutral
AMD,Do you even know what that bundle is for?,Negative
AMD,what would this AI package be? 🤔,Neutral

AMD,Since April or May,Neutral
AMD,Sorry I don't see the correlation between AI bundle and FSR 4 for RDNA 3....  What does adding AI software to the installer have anything to do with upscaling?,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, the first number always tells you what year the driver is from, the second number tells you what month it released in, and the last number tells you the ""number"" of the driver   so    26.1.1   is released in 2026 in January and it's the first AMD Driver in January.   If they would release another one this month it would be 26.1.2   one of the Few things I think AMD does WAY better then Nvidia does, cuz I switched to Nvidia recently and I have 0 freaking clue how their driver numbers are supposed to be read lol",Neutral
AMD,It was apparently fixed in 25.12.1 but I can't confirm it since I don't use it. >Intermittent application freeze when using the in-game Radeon™ Overlay.,Negative
AMD,"No, it's mostly for users that are not yet using it to make it easier to try.",Neutral
AMD,I bought the rx 9070 for dual use for gaming and training dl models  It was an important selling point to me the support for pytorch in windows,Positive
AMD,This is for simplifying running local models optionally and actually cool instead of pushing some weird integrated that’s running back to a datacenter. If it’s as promised in that linked blog post at least.,Neutral
AMD,Of course there is demand from the consumer side. Why do you think it's not the case?,Neutral
AMD,There is a large and rapidly growing community of people and small businesses who run local LLMs for all kinds of things. Check out /r/localllama   AMD gpus offer great bang for buck for AI use. I’ve got a 7900XTX and a W7900 I use for AI everyday.,Positive
AMD,"Consumers have **a ton** of demand for a lot of things with AI.  The demand for FSR4 has been all but rabid, and the amount of goodwill AMD is torching for no good reason by failing to release the INT8 model in-driver for the Radeon 7900/AI 395 GPUs is ramping up dramatically.  ComfyUI downloads will likely explode among RDNA3/RDNA4 AMD GPU owners as soon as it's not a PITA to set it up.  They just don't have any demand for 6 gigabytes of shitty chatbot or whatever the fuck Microsoft expects to get done with 40-50 TOPS in Windows while thoroughly dismantling any expectations of personal PC privacy and ownership.",Neutral
AMD,"Probably a little percentage of consumer. But my guess is to prepare their stacks (AI included) for pro-consumer and consumer with UDNA. Honestly, this is good news.",Positive
AMD,"Exactly, no one wants this shit. Only corp to enslave us and scammers .",Negative
AMD,Report to them but expect nothing I’m trying to play Silent Hill 2 and Oblivion Remastered for two months now. Their drivers break one or the other.   I hope that the UE hardware lumen fix they mention here is kind of generic because a lot of unreal engine games have crashing issues with hardware lumen.,Negative
AMD,"It is pretty much 2 installer bundled together. One for rx 5000/6000, and one for 7000/9000",Neutral
AMD,Can't use deeplinks to AMD driver files. Open the page of the release notes and find the link on that page. Or just use the AMD driver page and the small download that then detects which one you need and downloads less. The full 1.6GB is not really neeed for most users - only if you need to have the full offline installer for like deploying to a larger set of machines.,Neutral

AMD,Install over. DDU only if you have issues or if the old driver is like 3 years old.,Neutral
AMD,"Same with me, i got an RX 7600, it was just fine yesterday but now it wont even open the game",Negative
AMD,Is this a new behaviour with 26.1.1? I'm not too familiar with PC2 but generally photo modes will enable the most computationally expensive effects for its purpose. Is this a regression or something?,Neutral

AMD,"I get these in Black Ops 1, been happening with my old Vega 64 and my current 9070 XT",Neutral
AMD,"Firefox may actually be even more stable now, or less stable no issues over here yet, this was recent update on Firefox 147 so AMD was actually behind Intel and NVIDIA, no idea if it was disabled all this time because not supported, or because it was broken before and now fixed, videoplayback has been buggy in the past, and no one believed it was a driver issue until it got fixed and everyone proved otherwise.  They also testing HDR now finally on Firefox nightly  * Improved video playback performance on systems with AMD GPUs by enabling zero-copy playback for hardware-decoded video where supported, bringing them to parity with Intel and NVIDIA GPUs.",Positive
AMD,"This is something else, it’s either caused by the new driver branch from AMD or it’s an issue from Microsofts side. This has been going on for 1 or 2 months now not sure. It seems to get more frequent as well.   Hopefully this driver will fix it.",Negative
AMD,"Maybe, just maybe. I've always use Edge and never installed Chrome. My GPU history is like Vega64 -> 6800XT and now 9070XT. Never had a driver timeout once. I even only know it is a thing a year ago when I saw people talking about it on reddit.",Neutral
AMD,"There's still the occasional issue... For instance, Hytale seems to crash on 9070 series cards on Linux without warning.  Though, the difference is, on Windows, you're SOL until the driver or the game fixes it.  In Linux, you can set an environment variable for the game (and only for the game) to load a different driver (zink) that loses a bit of performance but solves the issue, so... S'long as you're willing to crowdsource fixes, Linux just lets you fix it.  And then, yeah, come in and look at the problems people are having on windows and... Well, people act like it's hard or something but I'm legitimately putting less effort into it than the people still waiting on basic fixes on the windows side, so...",Negative
AMD,"It is, once I rolled back to the 25.4.1 drivers I stopped getting the timeouts. Anything newer than that was very unstable.",Negative
AMD,"No - like others if I rollback to an older update from last year, this does not happen. It could be a combination of things, but I think it's definitely a bug in the driver.",Negative
AMD,So this applies to issues before this update how?,Neutral
AMD,"Ah, I've seen the issue outlined here except with the entire DWM with some of my crashes/hangs. Thanks for this!",Negative
AMD,"Its weird I had it once, and never again. Exact same driver. Frankly at this point I wouldn't be surprised its Windows and the driver not agreeing with each other once in a while.",Negative
AMD,I'm on windows 10 lol,Neutral
AMD,"Hmm... I've never seen it in Firefox though I'm using Windows 10, what card at you on?",Neutral
AMD,Haha your logic is good but you are horribly overestimating Microsoft :D,Positive
AMD,It's on any Chromium based browser if you have hardware acceleration enabled. If you are playing any media it has a chance to freeze and cause a timeout.,Neutral
AMD,"Possibly, however downgrading back to October 2025 driver version resolves the issue, so I am not convinced it's just Windows",Neutral
AMD,"Might be, but I only started getting them immediately after I switched from Nvidia to AMD last autumn.  So there is either a very specific Windows update timing that happened to overlap with my GPU change or there is an issue with AMD drivers.  Now that I think back, I don't recall getting driver freezes in January, so something might have been fixed by Microsoft.",Neutral
AMD,"I've had TDR issues survive a full OS reinstallation, I don't think it's just a Windows problem.",Neutral
AMD,yet some how rolling back amd updates too 25.9 somehow fixes it.... hmmm   ![gif](giphy|3o85xnoIXebk3xYx4Q),Neutral

AMD,Try driver 25.9.2 the problem is not there with that driver.,Negative
AMD,"I I have a 4k display there's no way I can run the game at reasonable settings without upscaling. 9070xt is what I have. I can just rollback to 25.9.2 and be done with it, gonna see if this driver does it if not I'll roll back just for this game.",Negative
AMD,"Since updating to Windows 11 25H2 I've had so many issues with MPO on my 6700xt, the multi-monitor or even just multi-window experience is so bad. Part of me is glad others are having similar problems so I can hope that either company can adress it at some point 😭",Negative

AMD,a bunch of people whining on reddit and techtubers throwing oil on the fire didn't change anything as they never said they were going to stop support.,Negative
AMD,They are literally just doing exactly what they've been doing for EVERY GPU they've ever made.,Neutral
AMD,Bug fixes are part of maintenance.  And why would you only count the exclusive ones? Their claim was those older cards wouldn't get any fixes.,Negative
AMD,can i ask you something? i only play newer games once in a while... do you think with a card like the 9070xt you even need fsr support for older titles? can't these cards just brute force rasterization? or are there still titles that are a few years older that benefit from fsr4,Neutral
AMD,"Same here with a 9070 XT, unchecking those ML FSR / FG boxes fixes all crashing.",Neutral
AMD,Isn't that only for lobbies?,Neutral
AMD,"It turned out that only applies when the support desk felyne is loaded and you don't already have a DLC notification, the rest of the game doesn't benefit.",Neutral

AMD,"Question, if you wanted to run local LLMs why not get a 5070 Ti?",Neutral
AMD,Hope you're right. Hopefully the new unified pipeline should make porting optimizations and SW side work easier. AMD can't be a serious alternative to NVIDIA with their horrible ROCm perf and lackluster FSR support.,Neutral
AMD,"Probably something is wrong with the OS, as the Adrenalin doesn't show the average FPS in the games stats no matter which driver version I install or whether I use DDU or not. At least everything else works fine, so that's good enough for me.",Negative
AMD,ah yes I got it. thanks!,Positive
AMD,They may as well deprecate it then since its not working anyway,Negative
AMD,"I'm not sure when the behaviour started, but I tested with 25.12.1 and 26.1.1 and they have the same issue.

AMD,"I was getting some intermittent driver timeouts on system boot which never seemed to actually affect my system performance or stability, but I haven't any pop up since the latest Windows 11 update last week.",Negative
AMD,I had that issue i think the second time windows update ripped out my driver software. Most recently I didnt realize that windows had done it again because it updated my GPU driver for the 9070XT to the internal driver but my CPU a 7700X still held onto to a 25.10.1 driver with the software that I also didnt install myself.,Negative
AMD,Does FSR4 upgrade of Avatar frontiers of Pandora fsr3 work in that driver version?,Neutral
AMD,"Even if you dont run upscaling, you can still lower resolution.  I know it's not normal for PC players to understand, but you dont \*have\* to run things at native resolution.    Sure, it'll take an image quality hit, but again, you still do have the option to play the game in any meantime.  It's not totally unplayable.",Negative
AMD,From what I've seen it's literally plug and play as in just download comfyui by selecting it from the bundle and it installs it with ROCM 7.1.1 setup for you. Now you just need to download the models and workflows and put them in the right folder (tpu article shows where this is).,Neutral
AMD,"You have two options:  1. Install the AI bundle including ComfyUI. It's an older version, and you can't add custom nodes, but it works. 2.

AMD,I saw people being compile pytorch for rdna2 themselves since preview drivers. Radeon just proves what they hate own customers,Negative
AMD,"No. You can DLL swap FSR 4 INT8 into the game directly, but for RDNA 2 you have to mod the driver too to get it to work right. With RDNA 3 you don't",Neutral
AMD,"That was never the claim. Neither from AMD, nor from Reddit.  AMD always stated that they will continue updating the driver but RDNA1/2 are moved to maintenance mode, and that game support will continue. Those things didn't really change, the only thing that Reddit achieved was getting AMD to acknowledge them better.  RDNA1/2 are still in maintenance.  I counted only the exclusive ones because the generic ones imply that the change happened outside of arch specific parts of the driver.",Neutral
AMD,"Plenty of titles benefit from proper upscaling, especially with RT involved. Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 and is still one of the best looking and heavy games out there. Thanks in no small part to the continued support.  You're looking at the problem from the wrong side: older GPUs are limited to garbage upscaling tech like FSR 3 and older (or XeSS which isn't great either), AMD released the RDNA1/2 compatible version of FSR4 which looks better than 3 and XeSS, but they're yet to acknowledge it or provide it in the driver as a DLL override.  Those older GPUs would benefit greatly from proper upscaling.",Positive

AMD,"Just go in the drivers and click on the game icon for MH Wilds, and (if they are checked) uncheck the boxes where it says ML FSR / Redstone and ML Frame Gen.

FYI these are the settings that tries to convert FSR Upscaling and FG to the new ML Redstone model, if a game supports it.",Neutral
AMD,The hub doing stupid stuff still hammers even bleeding edge CPUs and sees notably lower perf. Though idk if that's all the DLC check crap.,Negative
AMD,Thanks for that info. Helpful to know that. Appreciate it.   Main takeaway though is that it’s check ON for default installations - or was. So make sure you do custom install and toggle it off if not interested.,Positive

This one will also be binned better and prolly handle memory OCs better as well, to which the 9800x3d was known to have a bit of a weaker memory controller.  3300x was just a really cheap 4c8t cpu that AMD put out for a short while to get rid of some silicon they had lying around. It was popular cause for like $80 you had a cpu that could do some pretty decent gaming.  Knowing AMD as well, when they're trying to get rid of old silicon and make these products, they don't stay around long at all. It's a one and done, so that rarity will make them worth all the more down the line.  Say you get this now and upgrade 5 years later, you could prolly sell it still for $300+.",Positive

AMD,thank you,Positive
AMD,"Yeah that seems about right when comparing gaming benchmarks like time spy CPU scores  I think the fact that the 5000 to 7000 series being a am4 to AM5 jump highlights how big of an improvement the 9000 series is over the 7000 series  Even with the platform jump of am4 to AM5 and everything that comes with it (ddr5 ram, better mobos), the average score and highest score of the 5800x3d and the 7800x3d are closer than the average and highest of the 7800x3d and the 9800x3d, but the 9000 and 7000 are obviously both on AM5 so the 9800x3d isn't pulling that advantage with the jump from ddr4 to ddr5 as wind at its back",Positive
AMD,Which games are those? Because that might actually convince me to go for the 9800x3d.  I thought it was pretty close but I should have checked in more depth to verify. I thought it was only a few % quicker in certain games/Resolution? I should have informed myself better.,Neutral
AMD,"I've been playing Escape From Tarkov mostly since I got it, but you'll see similar results in games that are very CPU bound and/or cache sensitive.

Large victim caches are nice, but the sizes should be balanced between L2 and L3 to stop L1+L2 from relying too heavily on slower L3 (albeit still an order of magnitude faster than RAM). Sign me up for 4MB L2 + 16MB L3 per core, keeping a nice 1:4MB ratio between them. So, a 12-core would have 48MB L2 + 192MB L3 total. That's wild!  It'd be nice if we could use a physical CXL RAM storage cache that is something like NVRAM or MRAM because if RAM is slow, NVMe drives are still barely improving random reads/writes where we'd see the most performance improvement. Those high peak, deep queue throughput numbers kind of don't mean much. I thought DirectStorage would be better too. Instead it stutters like the rest of Windows features. Gah!",Neutral

AMD,"If the application doesn't overflow cache and hit memory, or isn't notably punished for doing so, there is effectively no difference between speeds for the average fps. AMD is correct about this, games don't care much under that specific circumstance.  Whats particularly important is latency though. Most applications \*are\* punished for overflowing cache, which the 3d chips have a bit of an advantage about, and the latency hit is what kills the 1% or 0.1% lows.  AMD doesn't seem to say anything about the specs of each kit beyond the speed. Its possible both kits have relatively similar latency. A 4800 CL24 has nearly identical latency as a 6000 CL30.  Theres a techpowerup article somewhere about Zen5 memory scaling using a 9950X and even that shows less than 10% going from 6000 CL28 to 4800 CL40 so you could close that gap pretty easily with better timings.

It's pretty obvious to anyone who understands how Ryzen and X3D works that performance is going to suffer *severely* when the non-V-cache CCD is trying to access data from the V-cache through the IO die on the other CCD, or from slow memory.   It's the reason I chose a 7800X3D instead of the 7950X3D I originally had in my cart, the extra cores just seem so incredibly pointless when only ~20% of my time is spent compiling or running VMs or rendering video or whatever else and the remaining ~80% is spent in-game.

At around $2000, a laptop that doesn’t match the gaming performance of similarly priced gaming laptops can be difficult to justify, and it may feel overpriced for users who don’t specifically need a high performance thin and light system.",Neutral

The marketing department is hitting rock bottom, with all these attempts at coolness and all-caps writing.  By Blizt_324 > You know what's funny? At least your edited image is more realistic when it comes to comparing hardware. You are pitting the 9070XT against the 5090, literally the best GPU of either company. AMD pits their own flagships against Intel's midrange models and pretends Intel's lineup doesn't have anything better.    With that out of the way, those comments are 100% correct. This ""call out"" is a waste of marketing resources and detached from the reality of the laptop market. Almost no one covered ""Gorgon Point/Gorgon Halo"" during CES. Even when AMD made a big splash with ""Strix Point/Strix Halo"" in mid-2024 there are almost no compelling laptops or products using those chips. Intel caught up with Lunar Lake, Apple continues to consistently put out high quality and good value Macbooks, and Nvidia still dominates mobile GPU.",Negative

AMD,"> Idk if AMD will beat Panther Lake this time in that aspect, but we'll see the reviews.  Strix Point barely beat Arrow (and only in multi thread power scaling while idle draw, media decoding, and various ultrabook workloads it's a wash at best). Straight up lost to Lunar Lake in pretty much everything apart from multi core, which is easily the least important metric in a <30w class ultrabook.",Neutral
AMD,"> but I don't need an integrated GPU   In regards to your post down the chain, that's a bit short sighted. A functional iGPU is nice to have.

AMD,"Seems like AMD doesn’t really know either.   It seems like you only hear about it from AMD is when they say stuff like here, like ""we’re still on top, we still have the fastest APU"".   They only compare it to products that aren’t really in the same class either.  Apples M4 systems are typically much cheaper and systems with dedicated GPUs perform better.  For local AI they haven’t shown a proper usecase for either yet. Yes, larger models do run on it but they’re so slow that you wouldn’t really want to use them.  I hope, they’ll find something for it",Negative
AMD,"The fact they still produce graphics for so many RDNA 2, 3 and 3.5 laptops, handhelds and consoles is the only reason I still have hope that they officially support FSR4 on the older architecture. It just seems recklessly malfeasant to abandon the stack.",Negative
AMD,"The 388 one is fun, should've been in the lineup from the start but oh well. Full 8060S and 8 cores, so a single CCD. The release timing is unfortunate. It should've been the FSR4 flagship product, such a perfect fit, oh well. Some day AMD will release the same arch for both APUs and GPUs, instead of this stupid 1 gen delay every time.  Generally I'm the target demographic for it. A person with a single laptop who works on it during the day and plays lighter games in the evening.

AMD,what are the cost effective options with 128gb shared memory?,Neutral
AMD,Exactly. I never go why APUs need such huge GPUs. it will be a waste of silicon for most and for the ones that need it it's till not enough.,Negative
AMD,I have seen multiple videos of YouTubers who went to CES and had hands on with panther lake. They were allowed to do everything except benchmark the CPU. They were allowed to see the TDP.  I think ETA Prime mentioned 65W max on a laptop he was trying. I don't know what Panther Lake was that.   DigitalFoundry has a whole podcast on the chips too. They aren't running at 115W this time round.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but only short term. And not on battery power which has been an emphasis with Panther lake. Strix halo will draw a sustained 120W+ all day",Neutral

AMD,"The leaked Geekbench6 scores are around 15k for multicore, which is really-really good, it is basically HX370 equivalent with a much better GPU. Also will be really curious about power draw, youtubers so far are saying really good things about battery life, so we'll see.",Positive
AMD,>Panther Lake has better graphics? By AMD’s own admission?  Given how they've been managing their APUs and iGPUs and the driver stack I feel like that wouldn't be a huge shock?,Neutral
AMD,"That's turbo clocks, if you apply that same logic  Strix Halo uses 120w as that's the max rated wattage.",Neutral

AMD,"It is a matter of choice. Back when RDNA3 is released they refused to put RDNA3 on APU too. We see it on APU today, so it was not impossible back then. No, it is not a design flexiblity.

AMD,What do you need 128GB (in reality it’s far less € shared memory for?,Neutral
AMD,Because they're building an all in one system so you can work and game on the same SoC. All while saving on PCIe routing. If you don't need the GPU part just get a 9xxx series CPU.,Neutral
AMD,"Agreed, it's shocking they stuck with RDNA3 for their APUs and iGPUs.  They must have assumed they wouldn't have any competition at that level, and could force anyone who wanted higher end graphics to buy discrete RDNA4 cards.  Miscalculation at this point.",Negative

Panther Lake isn't quite enough of a compelling upgrade over the Z1E--it's definitely a better chip, and it's an exciting prospect for people just entering the handheld PC space, but it's not quite enough to make me run out and upgrade from my Z1E handheld.  Once we get a mobile APU with the raster performance of Strix Halo but with a modern ML-driven feature set for under $1000 (in 2025 dollars) in a handheld, I'll be all over it.  Don't care if it's AMD or Intel.",Negative
AMD,And those run at like 5-10 tokens per second then?,Neutral
AMD,But for 128GB the memory is super slow. What do you need that for? Both Apple and NVIDIA only use 64GB on an Interface like that (and a faster interface for more than 64GB).  The DGX spark is specifically marketed as a dev kit not a desktop system. The DGX is up to like 8 times faster in AI workloads but in all AI related subreddits people don’t really see a point in that much ram that is that small.

AMD,"No one is talking about HBM memory.   Question is: what is it actually for? Yes, RAM capacity determines how big a model can be but with a 256bit memory interface it's very limited in performance. Even DDR4 based CPU systems come close to that with much higher performance.    A current Threadripper/Xeon W build easily beats it in both performance and memory bandwidth and memory capacity.   Apple offers 128GB too but with a much faster CPU, GPU and a 512bit memory interface at a much higher speed. Yes, it's more expensive but arguably better value.    The M3 Ultra comes with a 1024bit memory interface.   Both base DGX and M4 (Pro) use slightly faster LDDR5X with 8533MT/s RAM for their memory  The Jetson also exists too with faster memory but only 64GB of it.

There is probably a slightly bigger improvement on the NPU, and most importantly,but not immediately visible, probably some fixes that increase realibility, improve yield, reduce power consumtion, maybe fix some bug that would otherwise need a microcode workaround, tc. Lots of small improvements, none of which really matters by itself, but combined enough to make it worth it.

The dGPU laptop that I have, and have physically seen in stores, are all rather thick and heavy, at least in comparison to most iGPU based laptops.  I guess my question was really more about the packaging logistics.  People tend to buy iGPU based laptops cos they want something thin and light. An iGPU laptop that draws as much power as a dGPU laptop, and requires just as much cooling and weight to go along with that cooling, but still performs below that of a dGPU laptop for games is likely the issue here.  If you want a thicker, hotter, heavier gaming laptop, then you're going to want a dGPU as the tradeoff for that packaging.  The AI Max+ 395 asks for the same tradeoffs, but with gaming performance about on par with a 4060.

There is only one logical explanation for this article:   Someone wanted to cash in on the hype for the 9950X3D2 and chose some existing 9950X3D result as a baseline without any explanation.   With all the results, the 9950X3D2 is up to 30% faster or up to 5% slower than the 9950X3D, for any claim between that there would have been results to go with.

AMD,"Yeah, a few games do scale to multi CCX though (particularly when you have RAM and FCLK OC). With double vcache it would probably happen more significantly and more often than scaling onto a second standard CCD. Satisfactory for example runs 7% faster enabling second CCD on a 9950x3d with RAM OC and 2200 FCLK. It also often helps loading times, and basically cuts shader compilation time (and stutter) in half.  With zen 5 fixing the voltage tolerance issue, vcache CCD's are also significantly faster and more efficient than standard ones for productivity. They're basically just a better version of the CCD.  A big part of the issue with 3900x was that it had 3 core CCX's, while the 3800x etc had 4 core CCX's. The amount of cores in a CCX is really important, and 3 cores vs 4 cores affected so many games. A 9800x3d and 9950x3d both have 8 core CCX's (so it's not taking a major downgrade there), the latter just has a second one available too.",Neutral
AMD,9950X3D2 is 16-core with double 3D cache slices - one for each 8-core CCD.  There are quite a few advantages.

AMD,"The higher clocked non cache CCD makes more sense for non gaming applications on the 9950X3D.  And you still forget the fact of that the latency between the CCD’s is still a major problem that is going to be fixed starting at Zen 6 and not Zen 5. This means that in gaming you still have to limit the CPU to a single CCD so that means zero improvement in gaming.   When looking at workstation tasks, AMD has Threadripper which is what takes up that section of the market.   This means a dual CCD other than for testing purposes and engineering prototypes makes no sense.   And the argument that it is faster in benchmarks than the 9950X3D has also been debunked already.  All that and the extra costs it would be to make it and setting the price to sell at makes it not worth it for AMD.   Conclusion: 9950X3D2 is never going to be released to consumers.",Negative

AMD,"I don't think it's a specific genre exactly, but it does seem to be related to the sheer quantity of things to calculate in real time (for example AI scripts).  I don't really play Total War anymore but years ago I picked up Total War Troy because it was free on Epic Game store, that game easily gains like +50% fps when I enable the second CCD of my 9950X3D (can just run the built-in benchmarks to see it), I do use the ""prefer vcache CCD"" BIOS setting though, otherwise the gains are less (presumably because the main threads get put onto the wrong CCD). I don't know if newer Total War titles scale the same, but I think they should?  But then I also have M&B Bannerlord, and that one gains something like 5-30%fps by enabling the second CCD, depending on the scene. That's a third person medieval game though admittedly also a lot of AI units to manage, but no one would classify it as a RTS or simulator.   But yea I do think this CPU is pointless mind you. What we need is more cores per CDD.",Neutral
AMD,"> The higher clocked non cache CCD makes more sense for non gaming applications on the 9950X3D.  The non cache CCD's clock 2% higher, but vcache usually has at least a 4%+ IPC gain in productivity tasks (sometimes over +25%) on zen 5 and wins easily. It's rare to find anything that the standard CCD can match a vcache CCD in.  That used to be the case on Zen 3 and 4, but Zen 5 both scales more from vcache (in terms of IPC gain) and it no longer has a -220mv voltage restriction since they redesigned the vcache.  Looking at this kind of data, why would you pick the Standard CCD on purpose? Ignore all the games if you want, it's still just better across the board despite the 100mhz clock drop. https://files.catbox.moe/iy5ygj.png  > This means that in gaming you still have to limit the CPU to a single CCD so that means zero improvement in gaming.   It depends on the game, there are a few (e.g. Satisfactory and Riftbreaker) which see significant performance advantages from 2ccd on 9950x3d already - even though the second CCD is weaker, without vcache - which makes it the best CPU for those games. That is particularly the case when using RAM and FCLK OC's. My 2ccd perf on Satisfactory is ~7% higher than second place on the leaderboard because of this scaling.  It's also commonplace to see significant reductions in load time with multi-CCX, and having two CCX's basically cuts shader compilation time and shader compilation stutter in half.",Neutral
AMD,All you said is pure speculation and hopeful thoughts. AMD during the 9950X3D release said that a dual cache CCD is not economically viable and with practically no improvements to performance. I take AMD’s words over yours in this case.  It makes no sense for a dual cache CCD in Zen 5 while it will still suffer from latency between the CCD’s. That is not speculation that is a fact.   It looks more like AMD is testing for a dual CCD Zen 6 release which makes more sense because of the latency issues they are resolving in Zen 6.

AMD,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W.

AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough.

AMD,">We need to stop looking at the Core Ultra 9 285K through the lens of a typical generational refresh  That's all what consumers care about. They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs? Especially with the old intel socket performing just as well on a more mature platform, for most end users this first core ultra series just isn't worth investing.",Neutral

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware of CHIPS.  Like I said, I want Intel to be competitive. I hope if their new layouts mature into something that can retake marketshare that the same care will be taken to preserve AMD. AFAIK, no one came to lend them money or sign large multifaceted partnerships at that time. This ""must save Intel,"" movement is something that is borne out of how big Intel is. They're too big to fail, it would have too many implications for the economy.

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable.

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral

AMD,"As a real world example, I upgraded my primary system from a 14700k to a 265k recently. My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one.

Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one.

AMD,VR Support for ARC GPU? :),Neutral
AMD,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue. However, when I took my PC to Micro Center, technicians ran similar diagnostics and stress tests but were also unable to reproduce the freezes. They have also tested the PSU voltages and it passed.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

The real culprits are more likely things like memory issues, BIOS problems, or conflicts with virtualization features like Hyper-V.

AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Sk7Str1p3 I'm pleased to confirm that TME is indeed supported on your i7-12700F processor. TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.  Once you provide your motherboard information, I can guide you on how to check and potentially enable TME in your system's BIOS settings.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions.",Neutral
AMD,My motherboard is Asrock H670-M Pro RS. firmware version: 18.01,Neutral
AMD,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Negative
AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
