Intel,"so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding? and they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name? … but Xe3 plus will be enough to call it C series.",Neutral
Intel,"I loved how Tom Peterson did the circuit of tech blogs, tubers, and related last Fall to announce and advocate for ARC Battlemage.  Looking forward to seeing alot of him over the next few months for Xe3 and ARC C-series",Positive
Intel,Everything about Celestial I've heard seems to be regarding mobile. Is there actually going to be dedicated discrete graphics?,Neutral
Intel,The Intel driver downloading a shader cache for games from Intel sounds very noteworthy.   I'm really skeptical tying GPU drivers to a manufacturer's online service.,Neutral
Intel,"They don't care. These will be mid tier chips at best. The RTX IGPU ones will be their flagships. These are still damn impressive though, just have to make that clear.",Negative
Intel,"They may divide ABC depending on ISA/hardware capabilities used for example. Like AMD used ""RDNA 3.5"" on mobile as full RDNA 4 would pull more power due to more silicon dedicated to AI (including FSR 4 -\_-). RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4. So Xe 3B will be better than current but Xe 3C will do better at DXR and/or AI frame gen/whatever new tech they added.",Neutral
Intel,"This will help you to understand: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intels-xe3-graphics-architecture-breaks-cover-panther-lakes-12-xe-core-igpu-promises-50-percent-better-performance-than-lunar-lake  This is not brand new architecture, it's refinement on battlemage to work more efficiently. Thinks of it as Xe2.5 but for some reason marketing is calling it Xe3.",Positive
Intel,">they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name?      No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral
Intel,An alternative explanation could also be that Celestial dGPUs *are* launching as Xe3P and they would want the launch of C series iGPU and dGPU to be around the same time and the same architecture.,Neutral
Intel,">so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding?  Wasnt it always so? Xe is the architectural names, ABC was just branding for customers.",Neutral
Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.  They are excellent value products that would allow Intel to get a chunk of that market, given they are available in sufficient quantities at intended price points.",Positive
Intel,>RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4  Do you have a source for this? I vaguely remember 3.5 wasn't really bringing particular changes,Neutral
Intel,That's exactly what everyone's new GPU generation is.  An entirely new architecture is extremely rare for any company.,Neutral
Intel,That's not what Peterson was talking about context wise when he addressed this in the video.,Negative
Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,"There are more to that, if you look at RDNA 4 and blackwell for example they had changes to the SMs, enc/dec, etc.   Here it using basically the same cores, but changes are made to better utilize those cores. I think this sentence summarize it the best:  ""Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products"".  Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware. By going this route the basically giving pretty good improvement only year after initial release with basically almost the same drivers. It's just not a new generation but something in the middle between a refresh and a new generation.",Neutral
Intel,"Not rare, but more like it only happens when there's a paradigm shift in graphics that necessitates it.   GCN -> RDNA or Pascal -> Ampere are the most recent ones.",Neutral
Intel,"its not extremely rare. It happens once every 7-10 years or so when they redesign it for significant changes. but yeah, most generations will be refinement.",Neutral
Intel,"In the end it is all matter of marketing, filter it for a moment and understand what it's. As he said ""leverage all the good work from battlemage"". As I read it and looking the architecture it's battlemage with some enhancement that will come to future product celestial. Something like RDNA 3.5. I think they messed up the naming - they want to present it as something new and different (it's in some aspects) but it's not the real next gen in their roadmap.",Neutral
Intel,By discrete iam assuming you mean client graphics SoCs? The margins are not enough on those - you make much more money on Pro cards/ HPC.,Negative
Intel,"No this is not the case. The decision is purely branding. Xe3 and Xe3P are part of the same generation architecture wise unlike Xe2 and Battlemage, he addressed this.",Neutral
Intel,It's this. IGPU's will be for gamers and DGPU for data center. They basically both have said this :) People just don't notice anything. What do folks think RTX IGPU's on intel chips are gonna be for. LIKE LOL!,Neutral
Intel,"Then why he said ""when we move to our next architecture...""? Meaning they are not the same (Xe3 and Xe3P), also look at the slide they're grouping Xe2 with Xe3 under battlemage.  What you say contradicts their statements, and the article. The decision is of course marketing but nowhere they say Xe3 and Xe3P share the same architecture. This is why I said before it should've been called Xe2.5 or something of that sort like with RDNA 3.5.",Neutral
Intel,Next architecture is just rearrangement of existing cores into more effective set up. No contradictions.,Neutral
Intel,"When we will see deep dive into X3P celestial we will see what have changed. Until then it's just speculation of the differences between Xe3 and Xe3P. My bet there will be more changes than mere ""rearrangement of existing cores"".",Neutral
Intel,"Love a good TAP interview, hopefully he'll do some podcasts too once the embargo lifts.",Positive
Intel,"I like how TAP said ""expect even bigger investments in graphics in the future"". I hope this means what I think it means, because Intel \*must\* continue heavy investment in their own graphics. Accelerated compute is the future.",Positive
Intel,MLID must have an aneurysm seeing the guy still employed at Intel,Negative
Intel,"Tom's an absolute gem. It's so frustrating to see the most passionate and effective communicators locked up behind embargoes and NDAs, so fingers crossed that this marks the next wave of tech exploration and deep dives. Always nice to see him pop up in a random GN or PC World video.  Credit where it's due, Lex (Alejandro) has also always been attentive and forthcoming in his Reddit interactions, even factoring in the usual embargo/NDA constraints.

Intel,Igpus not discrete gpus,Neutral
Intel,"I would not attempt to read much into claims like that. This is marketing, not an investment roadmap. I'm sure if you pressed them on it, the lawyers would have some words.

Intel,Hahaha I can hear Tom saying “fucking Tom Peterson has been *lying* to you” as you say that,Negative
Intel,Problem is we don't know the real roadmap is for Intel. I really want them to put out a roadmap like they used to. But things in flux probably :s.,Negative
Intel,I think only way for intel to enter consumer GPU space is to start via iGPU at this point.  They just need to make bigger faster iGPU to make Nvidia RTX xx50/RTX xx60 redundant.,Neutral
Intel,I don't think partnership Nvidia iGPUs will be ready until TTL/HML circa 2029/2030.,Neutral
Intel,"Agreed, but then similarly I would also not attempt to conjecture on their roadmap outside of an investment roadmap... lack of a public roadmap update on graphics in a while is certainly saying something by not saying anything, but it's also not saying cancellations, etc...",Negative
Intel,There are just too many Toms in tech media. Tom of Moore's Law is Dead needs to thin out the competition.,Negative
Intel,I don't think even Intel knows what the real roadmap is anymore. They're so far behind on the previous ones that it's not surprising that they're not releasing new ones.,Negative

Intel,"You think Intel is going to maintain these footholds any longer than they would need to?  This push of their dedicated GPUs into the professional space, is just a mere attempt to get rid of the unsold inventory of ARC-GPUs at the highest possible price-tag right from the beginning – Dumping those into the enterprise- and datacenter-space, in noble hope that someone clueless might bite upon the Intel-brand, and then dip into it at high costs *at non-existing support software-support* Intel pretends to deliver some time in the future.

A tighter bottleneck is obviously not ideal, but it might still make sense depending on the price of the hardware.  As long as a copy of the full model and optimization state fits on the 24GB bank the PCI-E interconnect isn't really too limiting for training. Small models, like a 1B parameters voice model, will naturally fit.

Intel,"What I took away from the video: more or less fine with 5600 and up, still struggles with 2600. Intel is doing per game optimizations, so your mileage may vary. Space Marine is still struggling, Spider man 1 is running great, SpiderMan 2 does not.  Drivers are constantly improving, HUB has bright outlook. The bigger issue is 9060XT8 within 10-15% price range, but delivering 30% better perf.     Edit: A lot of people talking about how old or slow 2600 is in replies. And that's part of the point, I obviously didn't get across well. The issue is not the absolute performance, but the relative loss compared to AMD. In CPU bound scenarios they both should be close, since the limiting factor is CPU. But in this scenario 9060XT is even further ahead than when they are unconstrained.",Neutral

Microsoft is only now working on a directX based upscaler API that solves this problem. We should have had something like that years ago like we did for RT.",Negative
Intel,"I mean, surely it depends on when they have to share it. If they can release with the feature exclusively first, but then have to share at or after release, then it can still help the current generation of their cards until it's time for the new gen.",Neutral
Intel,"It makes adoption slower though. Especially for smaller devs and the smaller graphics vendors. Even now with pretty large games we still have software lumen only. If RT was pushed as an open standard earlier we might actually have more games and better implementation across the whole market, not just nvidias pet projects.",Negative

Intel,Nvidia controls 90% of the discrete GPU market on PC.   Anything proprietary that they make essentially becomes the standard going forward.,Neutral
Intel,"Huh?  1. RT in games is now done through DirectX APIs, which are vendor agnostic.   2. For GPU features, NVIDIA usually introduces them through a DirectX standard, they are just usually the first vendors to support it until others catch up.   3. RT is limited because current gen consoles are not good at RT. AMD took multiple years to adopt RT or AI acceleration cores.",Neutral

Intel,"> RT in games is now done through DirectX APIs, which are vendor agnostic.  Now being the key word, Nvidia launched their RTX before DXR was even available.  AMD's slow adoption is absolutely one of the problems which might not have not been so delayed if AMD, Nvidia, console makers and Microsoft worked on RT together from the start.   This is all just musing really. Maybe nvidia did us all a favour by breaking the mold forcing everyone else to play catch up.",Neutral
Intel,"Depends on country/industry. Copyright also depends on country, but for most civilized word its authors death + 95 years (thanks disney).

In Japan it does not and technically you can get sued for saying Zelda is fun because you broke copyright by saying Zelda without permission. Its why Nintendo is able to get switch reviews removed from youtube.",Neutral
Intel,The DirectX RT spec and SDK came out in 2018. The blame lies entirely on AMD. Imagine Nvidia waiting for AMD to agree,Negative
Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Negative

Intel,"It'll live on our hearts, yes.",Positive
Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

Intel,"Im not sure what you are implying, but nvidia partnerships have historically not broken from their side as far as I know.   Apple gave them the boot, not the other way around.   AMD are the ones who rejected the Nvidia-AMD merger back in 2005.   Tesla kicked nvidia out as well, because they did not want to keep paying them to develop the tech.   If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement. Even then, XFX only got blacklisted because they were a premier partner who were seen as jumping ship when the going got a little rough with nvidia stalling between 2009-2010.",Neutral

Intel,"Nvidia seems to make working with Nvidia too difficult for their partners to continue. It's the business version of someone emotionally bailing, and abusing you until you leave them.  They did that with smartphones, consoles, Linux, Apple, and likely countless other projects I didn't follow in as much detail.",Negative
Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.  But that is not the same thing as losing money on each card sold based solely on the bill of materials and distribution cost etc. Which is what actually matters when looking at if a product is ""sold at a loss"" or not.",Negative
Intel,"Hardly. Even after the bubble, Intel needs in house GPU, for both APUs and data center... which means they'll make a gaming version if the work is already mostly there.",Neutral
Intel,"In the case of Intel and Nvidia chipsets, it was Intel that decidedly ended the relationship, paying Nvidia off to exit the chipset business so that they could make integrated graphics.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, if nVidia has an Achilles' heel, it's their company culture's near total inability to do semicustom without fuckery, and it's the reason AMD dominates basically every high performance gaming graphics application outside of Windows desktops and laptops.",Negative
Intel,Well yes. But you do need to amortize the tape out and dev. costs over the production life cycle of the product. And with low volumes I'm not even sure AMD is accomplishing that. AMD is saved due to the console business funding dGPU tech development.,Neutral
Intel,"They've already cancelled every data centre GPU after Ponte Vecchio (which was forced out by DOE contract) despite reassuring us Rialto Bridge and Falcon Shore were on track as little as months before the chop, and their next is apparently Jagure Shore in 2028.

Might not be much, but it beats not selling them.  They might still be ""losing"" money on them when all costs are included.

So i expect them to be used here like HD Graphics and will get very little improvements from Xe5 onwards. Just to keep display and needed functions.  In a way they are still commited to GPUs   H, U and V are almost certainly getting their Arc GPUs replaced with RTX ones.  We all know with RTX tech those Laptop CPUs will sell a whole lot more and make intel way more profit. Anything with Nvidia's tech sells like pancakes now.  So going forward they can't recover Xe development costs through the laptop iGPUs using like they did before. Remember laptop iGPUs are the highest volume ARC sales.  Without those sale it's hard to justify full on Xe spending needed for dGPUs. Especially with Intel's financial situation.",Neutral
Intel,"This deal seems crazy.  For Nvidia that's an easy way to get custom x86 CPUs for datacenters and a way to directly compete with Strix Halo tier products.   If the products suck they can just blame Intel and walk out as if nothing ever happened. They don't really have much to lose here.  Even if they cancel their own CPU cores as a result of this deal, they can still use stock ARM cores in the future when/if the partnership ends...  But for Intel? For Intel this seems like a complete nightmare.  What did it take for them to convince Nvidia? It's hard to believe this won't have any impact on Arc... In the worse case scenario they'll be giving up on high-end graphics, just for Nvidia to abandon them right after when x86 isn't as important anymore...  This sounds like a desperate gamble, and it's difficult to understand where it came from because Intel does have pretty good iGPUs... Why are they so desperate?",Negative

Intel,There are definitely more Intel ARC iGPU users than Arc GPU users. This will lead to a cut in workforce (already happened) and more in the future. This also means less investment into things like XeSS.,Negative
Intel,The thing is that Intel barely sells any dedicated ARC cards. Almost all of their graphics userbase comes from Intel integrated graphics with their new XE tiles on them.

Like, the volume for both ""launches"" is supposed to be low, actual devices probably won't be available to purchase until the next year, but. Companies are supposed to be receiving samples of Panther Lake. Now. Presently.   For them to say their roadmap isn't affected, isn't changed at all. Unless that's a massive lie, that's only possible if samples of integrated Xe3 have already been fabbed, are already in working silicon.   ...Like, not to get too into the rumor mill, but supposedly the early Panther Lake samples aren't doing great. The CPU side isn't very efficient compared to Lunar Lake, and the GPUs sometimes don't work. But, when they do work, supposedly, the performance is really good, and, again, rumors, but the problem is supposedly more about Intel's drivers than the hardware or architecture itself.   ...I can completely believe that Intel would panic and would rather kill their GPU division entirely than. Invest in their software stack. Developing good technology and then abandoning it instead of advancing, because abandoning it is cheaper and easier is an extremely Intel move.   But if nothing else, the sunk costs for Xe3 at least make me feel like. They sorta have to figure it out, if only because they don't have time to replace it with NVIDIA, in the time frame Panther Lake has to come out.",Neutral

Intel,"I think client inference is kind of stupid. It's limited in capability by your local memory amount, and it's economically inefficient because you can't batch requests.  No AI system that exists is ""there"" yet, all of them can be improved enough that people would switch over to a better one. The current top of the line commercial models are hundreds of GB for the weights. To use client inference today you need to use a severely castrated model. Alternatively, if you ship all those hundreds of GB of DRAM on every device, they will be very inefficiently utilized because a single user rarely has the token flow to keep them working, and when they do it's all serial so you can't even batch, you just have to do a linear read over the whole model to get a single token out. And when there's an improved model next year that takes twice the ram you have to roll out whole new machines to the whole fleet.  In contrast, centralized inference can fit as much memory as you put on it, there are no power constraints, you can batch hundreds of requests in one go, and you can update the whole system much more easily. Client inference won't even win in latency because even though you have to pay for network latency, the centralized solution is probably much faster.  The only real advantage client inference has is privacy, and that's not a problem in business, they just get their own inference server. For office work, that even makes latency very fast.",Negative

Now the Intel+RTX looks more expensive right by costing 25%? WRONG   Cause if the two laptops are built with exact same components and Intel+ARC laptop costs $1000, the Intel+RTX laptop would cost $1100.  Suddenly the Intel+RTX becomes the obvious choice at only just 10% more money.  It gets worse the higher you. $1500 intel+arc v $1600 Inte+rtx.

Intel,"B580 needed to get out very early to beat RTX 5060 and RX 9060 to the market. Nvidia's and AMD's cards outperform it in gaming raster performance thanks to having been in the market for much longer. They have the more efficient architecture and software for gaming. It wouldn't be great for marketing if Arc came out at the same time with similar pricing, yet got beaten in the FPS benchmarks.  But productivity cards could wait. Arc's always been very competitive in productivity tasks. Maybe because Intel has more experience in this department. So reliable driver is the focus here.",Positive
Intel,">Only if your marketing plan is to sell 0 gpus because who will buy gpu with bad driver and application support?  Good driver and application support is not possible to deliver without a significant install base of your product in the wild. PC configurations vary wildly and usually driver issues are about some bad luck combination of hardware, driver versions, and application versions.  The incumbency advantage in this market is immense.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

Intel,"iirc, SR-IOV and VDI support in the coming months, toggleable ECC support, and it is ISV certified",Neutral
Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral
Intel,Software support is a thing. CAD applications like solidworks and inventor don’t officially support the GeForce rtx or radeon rx line of gpus and they’re considered untested unsupported options.

I'm not saying it's extremely profitable but it can't be too expensive to make since a portion of the volume is likely faulty G21 dies that can't make a B580 or B580.

AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Intel,"It's needed whenever the work you're doing matters and a single-bit error could cause significant harm.  Something like audio or video, a single-bit error probably isn't very noticeable.  Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Intel,"The problem with Gaudi (I know, I've written code and run training runs on it) is simply that the programming model is not oneAPI, or whatever oneAPI becomes. Yes, pytorch works, but people care a lot about software longevity and long term vision when buying $5mm+ of GPUs (and these are the purchases Intel cares about that can actually start to offset the cost of development).   The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package. Unifying graphics and compute packages is what NVIDIA was able to achieve but not yet AMD, and it's really great for encouraging ML development in oneAPI.

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time. Plus you are limited on virtual machine by the physical GPU count. It works with Intel GPUs and is FOSS with them.  SR-IOV on Intel fixes all of that. It works amazingly well with their iGPUs, has no license issues, and is fully FOSS.",Negative

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral
Intel,"It's good they launching this, this card adds some competition to the landscape, but before anyone buys it they should figure out if their drivers are lighter weight.  It's hard to think of this fitting a niche of someone with a pretty powerful CPU who wants a midrange GPU.

They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive

After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple.

Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung. SD8EG5 seems to be closing the gap, and that'll be very interesting tho those GB numbers don't tell things like power.",Positive

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral

Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip.

Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.

I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU.

Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power? On a phone, I'm of the opinion that power is paramount and should be forced to lower levels.",Neutral
Intel,">Aren’t they exactly the same p cores?  Definitely not. See the SPEC perf / GHz: A19 is nearly just the A18 Pro. Thus, this seems to be the final picture:  A19 Pro = new uarch, 32MB SLC, 12GB LPDDR5X-9600  A19 = binned OC of last year's A1**8** Pro, w/ faster LPDDR5X-8533, but smaller SLC (12MB)  New uArch clearly didn't pan out as expected in fp efficiency. A19 Pro may sit at a flatter part of the freq / power curve, A19 Pro may have more leakage, A19 Pro's [faster RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A19) may eat *a lot* power (Geekerwant tests mainboard power, not purely CPU power), etc.",Neutral

Intel,">I think AMD will have a hard time to win any efficiency crowns, but historically speaking they always had the peak ST performance on process node. Of course this is not as impressive because those are desktop chips which draw 100W+, and there have been historically gaps between desktop and laptop chips in ST for AMD (even though laptop technically had the TDP to sustain ST).  M2 and Zen 4 launched around the same period. The desktop chips score around 5-10% faster in Geekbench while using 20W per core power and 30-40W more for the I/O die. Taking the ST crown by a hair's width while using 5-10x more power isn't a win at all imo.",Neutral

Intel,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Positive
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year.

That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving.

Intel,"Does it actually fall behind the b580 or is it due to vram bottleneck in certain instances?  Either way, this should open up people’s eyes about the b580. The b580 is just marginally above the 5050, which is a terrible product, with 4gb more vram… even at its 250 dollar price point, it’s never been a good deal.

Intel,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working. Those will be some absolutely sad little GPUs.",Neutral

Intel,Same can be said for the 5050 no? Both have CPU overheads unlike AMD which any mid-range AMD GPU can easily outperform Nvidia's 5090 at 1080p.   The 12GB VRAM however are better suited for people who are stuck at older Gen3/Gen4 PCIE speeds.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll run nearly every game in existence at 1080p with playable framerates with the right settings. IDK why it would be a product for non-gamers.

It's so bad that even the prebuilts with the 16GB 9060XT will be outsold by prebuilts with a 5050 at the same price range, as companies like to pair trash GPUs with ""high"" end CPUs like a 13700F to clear stock but the ""i7"" allows them to mark up the price.",Negative

This card is 80% the performance of a 5060, which should probably be called the 5050.  To take it a step further, the GT 1030 was 13% of the 1080ti, the 5050 is 20% of the 5090.

Intel,"It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup. You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral

Also comparing the performance diff between the 1030 vs 1060 because guess what the 5060 should have been the 5050 looking at die size and memory bus.   Not sure why people keep defending these naming schemes, do you think the engineers use them internally lol? Its bullshit that marketing comes up with",Negative
Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters. How large the top die is and what core configuration it has. Is irrelevant for the value for cards further down the stack.",Neutral

Intel,Someone’s awfully angry haha the guy didn’t post anything regarding budget. I also mentioned 5060 was a huge upgrade and just said what I would get.   If he’s gonna go through the trouble of upgrading his CPU and ram which would require a new motherboard anyways why not get something that’ll last him years. No one “needs” half the pc parts they get but if you keep your pcs for 6+ years then yes a 7800x3d would be a much better choice.   It’s already dropped in price and likely to go on sale during Black Friday. Also gives the guy a chance to upgrade his monitor over the next year or 2 if he so chooses.  You see I don’t mind going to work saving my money and spending just over $1000 for a pc I’ll get years of use out of.

You a bit overkill on the psu as the wattage is nearly double what you might be putting together. Great for later upgrades but overkill for this build.   It is not a bad combo deal but there are better choices to be had. The ram is slow but you can use it for now. I would change the ssd. That is a gen 3 and you wil want at least a gen4 with a higher speed.   Using your combo I would change the cooler, cheaper option with good performance, the ssd, while budget and not the fastest it is 2tb gen 4 with decent speed and fully modular 750 80+ gold atx  or you can stick with your 850 watt which ever you prefer.

In your last post, we advised you that your ram was too fast because you had a CL28 ram kit. you might have over-adjusted and picked slow ram, my friend. 5600mt is good speed, but cl46 is slow reaction time.

Intel,The best upgrade would be the 7800x3D/B850 MoBo/2x16gb 6000 CL30 RAM. It will absolutely be an increase in FPS and it will improve your FPS drops.,Positive
Intel,"If you are building your computer and unless you are spending like under $700 on the computer I would recommend that you go with an AM5 CPU. AM4 only really makes sense if you really have to like get under $700 and more in the $600 and below range.  If you are building on the AM5 platform then you probably want either a 7600X or a 9600X. The 9600X is only about 3 to 5% faster than the 7600X, but the price has come down considerably and has even dipped cheaper a few times.   If you're going all out then you can get a 7800X3D or a 9800XD3, but I would really only consider those for like really top-end expensive builds that are more than two grand. They shine the best when paired with a high end GPU on low end resolution because you can get ridiculous fps. They also do a little bit better on extremely CPU intensive games but I don't know if battlefield 6 is that intense, I'm pretty sure like a 7600 would be fine.",Neutral

Intel,"well, sometimes a Used PSU is a good deal, but u have no clue how old this PSU is or what its been through. Just my opinion but spending like £65 for something even like the Thermalright KG-750 is worth it over a potentially old and worn PSU.  As for the RAM, I mean buy as much as u can when u build honestly, DDR4 will only get more and more expensive if bought new as its no longer being produced. and yes 3200 CL16 or 3600 CL 18 is a great option for a 5700x",Neutral
Intel,"I'd saw the thermalright ones on UK pcpartpicker but I didn't recognise the brand, are they reputable? I don't want to burn my house down but I suppose an unknown second hand one is just as risky.  I thought the ram would be cheaper tbh but that makes sense.",Negative

Intel,Goes a bit over my budget. Probably going to go with the B580. Thanks!,Neutral
Intel,"You can reasonably assume that there will be driver support for a significant amount of time for the B580, honestly it'll probably be supported for the entire time that you have the card.

Intel,This is shit. Hopefully they still make the mid range 700 series. I was sort of holding out for that but it's taking too long.,Negative
Intel,"This does suggest that Intel GPU unit will likely get the axe.  It also suggests that ARM doesn't have the HPC ability of x86.  ARM was half as fast, at the same power, as AMD EPYC.

Intel,They aren't going to sabotage a division of a company they just bought for 5 billion. I think it's a problem for the new year release of the 7 series cards though.

I'd expect a 10% jump in msrp but still.. They aren't in business to lose money. I think they'll keep production going personally, put their stamp on it, sell it for a bit more and keep the status quo.   I think they were worried about what the new intel card was going to do to their low/mid range lineup. The dev cost for the 700 series has already been spent. They will release it..

Intel,Save a little more and buy 9060 XT 16 Gb to serve long life without pain in the ass because of potential Intel discontinuing of support or lack of VRAM - this is the best solution.,Positive
Intel,"B580, the 8gb 9060xt isnt a super attractive option. The 16gb variant is a better card but its usually above ~40% more than the b580",Negative
Intel,"If you are not going to be buying a new gpu for a good few years I would go with the 9060xt. There is no telling how long Intel is going to maintain driver support, and how much improvement there will be with the driver support that is left. B580 still suffers with issues from launch like cpu overhead, if there are game specific bugs or optimizations that they need to do for in drivers for new titles you might just be shit out of luck.",Negative
Intel,B580 is significantly slower on weaker cpus like your i5. Get a 9060xt,Negative
Intel,Neither. Get used if those are your only new options. 8gb is not enough for a new card and Intel GPUs are e-waste and are plagued with driver issues. I also doubt Intel is going to be pumping resources into improving that situation because dedicated intel graphics are effectively canceled.  9060 XT 16GB is the cheapest GPU worth buying new.,Negative
Intel,That 9060XT will become obsolete by its own VRAM very very soon. Either save for the 16GB version or go with the B580. Run away from any 8GB GPU if you want it to last more than a year.,Negative
Intel,"It's a solid GPU for the price point. Just keep in mind that it isn't really ""on sale."" That's the MSRP for it.",Positive

Intel,"It’s unpredictable. GPU prices are trending downwards, but you never know what’s going to happen. My opinion is if you need the GPU, just get it.",Negative
Intel,Huge leap in performance if you can squeeze a little more I would go with 9060XT 16GB.,Positive
Intel,"From the research I've done, a lot of the more widely seeked out GPU'S sell out before black friday. So if you see one you like at a price that fits your budget before then, go for it. Here in the next couple of weeks I'm planning on getting mine (9060xt 16gb).",Positive

Intel,B580 has weird ass bugs so if ur ok with tinkering : troubleshooting weird stuff occasionally it’s good,Negative
Intel,Sometimes they put them on sale towards the end of the day when they are getting close to expiry date.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm wondering the same about the 9060xt 16gb.  they're quite cheap right now so I don't want them to go up in price or go out of stock, but I'm not sure I can afford one right now but maybe in January or so.",Neutral
Intel,"When they are cheap and make sense to buy. There is no set time, prices change all the time for countless different reasons including random sales.  Any decent current gen GPU for $250 in 2025 is not bad. You can get 3-4 years out of it no problem, then think about the next upgrade. And if you're lucky you can recoup about 40-50% of the cost you paid for the card when it was new.  I paid $250 for a 6700XT three years ago to the date. Still using that card now, and it's worth the same.",Positive
Intel,It's pretty random. Sometimes the price of last gen GPUs go down a little when a new one is coming out but demand fluctuates wildly directly affecting prices & availability. Most of the time when a new GPU comes out the inventory gets snatched up pretty quickly by bots online at retail price then people flip sell them for almost double the retail price. Your best chance of getting a new GPU for retail price is maybe Best Buy or Microcenter.,Neutral

Intel,Sometimes you can find bags of them in the dumpster behind bestbuy after they close for the day,Neutral
Intel,I just traded in an RX 7600 for a 9060xt 16gb from NewEgg and it has been awesome.  I was on the fence for a while but I’m happy I went with it,Positive
Intel,I've seen several comments recommending it so I actually cancelled my order I had placed of the B580 to reevaluate lol. It seems that even the 8GB version of the 9060XT is a tier above the B580. Would the 8GB version be worth getting over the B580? Or only the 16 GB version?,Neutral
Intel,At 1080P most games no issues but AAA games of the future could limit graphics at higher settings.,Neutral
Intel,would absolutely not recommend getting 8gb of vram in 2025  just get 12 or 16 and not worry about it for years,Negative
Intel,Consider a used 3080 too. It's faster than both and has dlss4,Positive
Intel,nice.  I'm on a 3060 and still deciding if I should upgrade for bf6 or not.,Positive
Intel,"No, don't get any 8GB card. Performance suffers, graphics quality can really suffer, on newer games. The price difference is small, get a 16GB card.",Negative
Intel,If it's just about the vram then he might as well just get the B580.,Neutral
Intel,"Why not try BF6 on your current system and see if you're fine with the performance at the settings you prefer? The game comes out tomorrow (October 10), so you'll have an answer soon!",Positive
Intel,It's as if it's not all about vram... Which was the entire point of me linking the video.,Neutral
Intel,"Clearly shows the B580 being the weaker card, **despite having more vram.**  >getting a new 8gb card in 2025 is always going to be a bad idea, it's extremely limiting.  Yet the 12gb card is clearly weaker. Pick a lane.  Where in the planet can you buy the 16gb variant of the 9060 XT for $260?",Negative
Intel,"And here, ladies and gentlement, is a fine example of the dunning-kruger effect in action.",Neutral
Intel,What are you upgrading from? What resolution do you play at?  [https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb.c4292](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb.c4292)  its 65% faster. 5060ti 16gb is like a strong 1080p to entry level 1440p card while 5070ti is a strong 1440p card to a decent 4k card. I'd say it's worth the upgrade. usd msrp is $750 so I'm not sure which country you are buying in.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes it’s definitely worth it. The 5060 are entry level cards, 5070ti should blast through any game as long as you’re not playing at 4K",Positive
Intel,"You get ARC Raiders Deluxe Edition if you buy a 5070 or better right now.   So that narrows the margin by 60 bucks that you’re going to spend anyway, so I’d get the 5070ti.",Neutral
Intel,"100% worth it if you can afford it. i got my gf a 5060Ti 16gb because she plays minimal games and Im a broke student where that extra $120 is really crucial for me. otherwise, the 5070 is better value.",Positive
Intel,"At 1440p, yes.  At 1080p, no.",Neutral
Intel,the 5060ti will probably fulfill your needs but will it sate your wants is the question.,Neutral
Intel,"yes.  especially if you are playing ""competitive"" type first person shooters AND you have a high hz monitor and want smooth gameplay.   there are people who play only older games or ""cinematic"" single player games and having 60hz and 60fps is fine.   but for online multiplayer shooters, higher hz and fps matters more.",Neutral
Intel,"I think if you want to have very high performance for the next few years, yes.",Positive
Intel,Yes for sure.,Positive
Intel,"I've had both (currently on the 5070ti). It was well worth the extra money.   I play a lot of vr, and using the exact same settings,  my 5060ti was almost always running at 100% usage, my 5070ti does not even break 50% usage",Positive
Intel,"Yes. It is faster but the fact you asked this question, if you go with a 5060 Ti, you’re probably going to have serious FOMO right away. Just bite the bullet and get the card you want, especially if you’re planning AAA titles.",Neutral
Intel,Most likely if your current power supply can handle it and you're playing above 1080P.,Neutral
Intel,"very worth it, looking at around a 66% performance jump at 1440p.",Positive
Intel,"I have the non-ti plain old peasant 5070 and it runs any game at 1440p, 120fps with no issues.",Positive
Intel,"I got the 5060ti Good 60fps at 1080p on cybperpunl full ray tracing. Its a good card for 1080p. But had to RMA and got a 5070. Middle ground: way to overkill for 1080 but lacks a punch for 1440p. Then had to rma again (both Zotac twin edge fans) and got a MSI 5070ti. Crushes 1440p as well as 5060ti crushed 1080p. Both are good cards, just pick your resolution and go with it, for me it was worth",Positive
Intel,"Don't believe anybody claiming the 5060TI 16gb isnt capable of 1440P gaming. This card is an absolute unit. Mine is overclocked and the performance is slightly higher than stock 4070/3080. It sips power at 140-170 W, super quiet, runs everything i throw at it at 2k fully maxed out. I play the witcher 3 next gen fully maxed out ray tracing and all and hair works with DLSS Q im getting 55-60 FPS. Throw in framegen and thats an easy 100 + FPS. And yes framegen is amazing i dont care what doomers have to say. Also having 16gb of vram gives me peace of mind with no texture popping whatsoever. Honestly id grab it if the price difference is that high",Positive
Intel,Yeah just get the 5070TI at that point if you have the money for it. Even the 5070 with its 12GB of VRAM is better than the 5060 TI 16GB. Especially if you're gaming at 1440P or 1080P. Right now since it's prime day I'd also take a look at the 9070XT as it's right around the same price as the 5070TI or could be cheaper. And it's raw rasterization it's on average about 5-10% better than the 5070TI depending on the game. But if it's cheaper than might be the better buy.   Obvs if you just want NVIDIA then just stick to them but I'd take a look at the prices to see what makes sense for you,Positive
Intel,Yes,Positive
Intel,1080 - 5060 1440 - 5070,Neutral
Intel,"Just last week I was mulling the same thing.  I bought a 3060 in 2021 because that was the only thing I could get my hands on.  Now that we're back at MSRP, I thought to myself, ""will this last?""  With all the turmoil, I figured it may very well be possible that we don't see MSRP for another 4-5 years, so I just went with the stronger card to, hopefully, last me longer.  My 5070 TI just came yesterday and I don't regret it.",Neutral
Intel,"The 60 cards are mostly 1080p/ultra. 70 is 1440p/ultra. 80 is 1440p/ultra high fps and 4k. 5090 is overkill but good for production jobs.  These are numbers for unoptimized 2025 AAA games. If you play old stuff, 5060ti can probably be a good 1440p card for that",Neutral
Intel,Yes,Positive
Intel,"Only you can make the call, but yes, they are *very* different GPUs. The 5070 Ti is an entire two performance classes above the 5060 Ti, and close enough to the 5080 that people question whether that is worth the extra cost. Do you need all that extra performance? Who knows, but the difference in price is definitely warranted.",Neutral
Intel,"If you can afford (this is the important part) it you should always go for the better card. Trust me, no one ever regretted buying the better card at the end but many did regret not spending a bit more to get the better card.",Positive
Intel,"What's your setup?   Are you playing 1080p, 1440p or 4k?   What PSU do you have?   What CPU do you have?   What do you plan on doing for future upgrades?   These are all relevant in deciding whether it's worth it or not! But fundamentally the 5070ti is an incredible card!   Or, you could get nigh on 5070ti performance, but at least cost, with an AMD RX9070xt. Prices probably vary depending on where you live though!",Positive
Intel,"i would say the middle point between those 2 would be the normal 5070. Its at msrp or lower nowadays. Its the one i use and i like it. It runs any game better than the 9060 xt or the 5060 ti.   But if you want more power and you can afford it, go for the 5070ti. In my case after seeing what i play the 5070 was the perfect fit for me.",Positive
Intel,Why not a 5070?,Neutral
Intel,"Consider your CPU as well. I just bought a 5070ti, and while it's great, any game that demands CPU power is not a big difference. Basically any multiplayer game i've tried doesn't appear 65% better.  Also, at least where I am, the 5070ti is 75% more expensive after tax.",Neutral
Intel,Make the big jump *and* save yourself some money by getting the 9070xt,Positive
Intel,Yes it is on another level.,Positive
Intel,The price is almost double because the performance is almost double. Get the best you can reasonably afford,Positive
Intel,Get the RX 9070 Xt if you do end up going with saving. The Rx 9070 Xt performs much better than the Rtx 5070 Ti. AMD GPUS also work better with Linux (which doesnt necessarily affect everyone but is still nice),Positive
Intel,5070ti and 5080 are only like 250$ apart with all the sales going on... might wanna just get a 5080.,Neutral
Intel,I'm running on a 3060 TI currently and run on a 3440x1440 ultrawide monitor,Neutral
Intel,"lol what? I’ve been using 5070Ti for months now, and had no trouble running anything at 4K. It absolutely crushes 1440p.",Positive
Intel,5070 ti imo is 4k card with some caviat (dlss),Neutral
Intel,"I didn't even know this until AFTER I bought the card, which was awesome because I hadn't preordered arc raiders yet lol",Positive
Intel,"Just curious, why not the 9060 16gb?",Neutral
Intel,What about the non-xt 9070? How/where does that fit into all this? Is it a better buy than the 5070 non-ti?,Neutral
Intel,What about the non-xt 9070? How/where does that fit into all this? Is it a better buy than the 5070 non-ti?,Neutral
Intel,https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-9070-xt.c4229  The 9070 xt is on average slower than the 5070 ti in raster although it can be faster in some titles but on the other hand the 5070 ti has some pretty big outliers occasionally  20-30+ percent faster in a few titles in raster,Neutral
Intel,Wdym much better it is litterly slower with worse features,Negative
Intel,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w94bD3S8K0M&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w94bD3S8K0M&t)  5080 is the worst price performance card of this gen and this video illustrates the point well. tldw, both cards are strong 1440p and decent 4k level cards, you are getting basically the same gaming experience for worse price performance and same vram.",Negative
Intel,The 5070ti is definitely a better buy than the 5080 a for the price. You get very little more power for that 350-400 price difference. If they were $750 vs $850 then sure but not 750vs1000 or more depending on location,Positive
Intel,"5070 ti, or a used 4070 ti super.",Neutral
Intel,5060ti 16gb is a 30% jump but tbh its not worth it. Id say a noticeable change to your gaming experience would be a 5070ti and it would better handle your resolution,Negative
Intel,"This is what I upgraded from to 5070Ti, it’s another league, you won’t be disappointed.",Positive
Intel,"People subjectively have their own opinions about performance. So, for many a card that does 4K/60 isn't a ""4K card"" because it doesn't do 4K 90, 120, etc... which is wild because not long ago that argument was ""but can it do 4K 60?"". Or, they move the goal post in some manner.  And the market is now flooded is cheap high refresh rate mid quality or worse IPS screens, because it sells better than a quality accurate display at a lower refresh rate. Some prefer visual fidelity and some prefer higher frame rates. It's not like they can't coexist, instead people just project their opinions about resolution, framerates, and panel type.",Neutral
Intel,Depends what you accept as acceptable. I prefer max quality 90+ for single player. 140+ multiplayer.. I also went 240hz and no card does that in new games in 4k without DLSS or frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,Well depends on the game and RT settings.,Neutral
Intel,I mean it’s like what 4k 50-60 usually? If that’s what you like that’s fine but I personally wouldn’t l call that great,Neutral
Intel,Game looks so good. As a tarkov refugee I can’t wait for it to come out.,Positive
Intel,"$380 at Best Buy when I got it so close in price to a 9060xt, and the bigger reason is because she wants to get into content creation and I opted for nvidia’s better hardware encoder.  otherwise I would’ve gotten her a 9060XT.",Neutral
Intel,"It essentially has the exact same performance as a 5070 at 1080P. But the 9070 is slightly better at 1440P and also has 16GB VRAM. It also is exactly the same price most of the time, should be about $550 for both. Even in Ray tracing the 9070 is actually on par or better than the 5070 in most games RDNA 4 really was a big leap for AMD.   It really comes down to price and if you find either below $550 it's a really good deal on the 5070 or 9070. Finding either the 9070XT or 5070TI at below $750 would also be a really good deal.",Positive
Intel,Overall that might be true I was probably reading an article or viewing a video where the test cases favored AMD looking back at Daniel Owens video where he did 100 benchmarks on both overall the 5070TI was indeed about 3-4.5% faster generally speaking.      I did see a video where the 1% lows were actually quite a bit better on the 9070XT but honestly can't find the source so I could be talking out my ass on that.  But realistically they are more or less the same unless its in RT Performance than the 5070TI is the one to get for sure,Neutral
Intel,Got a guy i know that runs a 4070 and claims they are playing on 8k. Claim kinda confusing to me.,Neutral
Intel,Im sorry I dont speak serf.,Negative
Intel,"Its about preference I guess. I want 120 FPS stable, which I won’t get with 4K in many games. 120fps is more important than 1440 vs 4K, since I play on a tv and it is a few meters away.   I can’t really see the difference between 4K and 1440p.  It may have been different if I gamed on a large screen close to my face.",Neutral
Intel,4K is awesome but I absolutely hate 60 for multiplayer. Loving my 1440p OLED for 5070ti,Negative
Intel,"It can do many games at max quality with more than 90 frames though... Cyberpunk native, absolutely not, but neither can a 5080 or a 5090.",Neutral
Intel,I ran a 7900XT for a while with a 4K 144hz monitor and never felt it was struggling. Many multiplayer games above 200fps native The 5070ti is a more powerful card as well.,Positive
Intel,No? Most games I’m playing surpass 100+ with DLSS,Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate that, thanks!",Positive
Intel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/s/BJXoqoh8WQ  Yes the meta review shows in about 30-40 or so of the reviews the 9070 xt was faster than the 5070 ti in like 6 or so. Averaging the reviews the 5070 ti was slightly faster like 3-5 percent  Basically it is game dependent which is faster but there are a few large outliers for the 5070 ti that push it over on the average  Rt performance is also very similar between the two only(10-20 percent difference)   path tracing is where there is a major difference but that is only in like 3 games,Neutral
Intel,Its possible  The games they play might be easy to run or they are not sensitive to low/choppy fps. I’ve never heard of an 8k monitor being used lately haha,Neutral
Intel,"I have a 4090. But even if I didn't have one, it's just the objective facts lol",Neutral
Intel,Yeah what are you running there big dawg?,Neutral
Intel,Then why are you talking about a 5080 instead of a 5090? Surely you're trolling?,Negative
Intel,"Yep, it's absolutely a preference. Personally I prefer the visual fidelity, but that's a personal preference fuled in part by my background in graphics. Do I want higher frame rates too? Absolutely. But, gaming at 4K on my 32"" display varies a lot by tittle with some modern titles being a rough ride, particularly with any RT. If I was mainly playing FPS games and competitive shooters, I absolutely would prefer a lower resolution and higher FPS. Since I primarily do design, the higher PPI is more important for clarity than the headache of driving a game at 4K. Of course, I do absolutely love the beautiful butteryness of a OLED screaming along at a high FPS. I've considered adding a second OLED to my setup just for gaming, but damn if I don't have room for another chonky monitor.",Positive
Intel,Yeah I hate 60fps. Everyone has their own preferences for sure.,Negative
Intel,I have no idea. Had never heard of it being done before myself. I run 3440x1440 34inch myself. Didn't even know 8k monitors existed. Hence my confusion.,Neutral
Intel,Maybe he uses a TV? Most newer TVs are great monitors although if they're too big you need to sit further away.,Positive
Intel,"Ahhh, ok that makes sense. Totally forgot about TV, that's cool! Thank you.",Positive
Intel,"If you can afford to step up to the 9060XT 16GB, it's much better. It's about 30-40% faster on average and has 4GB more VRAM. Not to mention better driver support and access to a better upscaler with FSR 4.   Why are you considering going down to the B580?",Positive
Intel,The b580 is a great tinkering machine or amazing if you're building for video editing first but for a PC gamer who has to ask I'd avoid it. It's fine if you literally only play new releases a month after release but for freshly released stuff or anything before like 2022 it can get rough. It's kind of like being in a really cool beta nobody's sure if Intel will commit to,Neutral
Intel,"9060 XT, not even a question imo.",Neutral
Intel,The B580 is great if your CPU can handle it. Judging by the pricing you gave in that other comment i'd say it could be worth it. That all depends on your CPU though.,Positive
Intel,I love mine. Got it for $200. Maxes out my 1440p monitor on maxed out settings on fh4 native no fg. Runs other games great too. Can't wait for mfg support!,Positive
Intel,"Don't listen to the other people here. As someone who owns 9070xt, 5060ti and B580, the Intel card is an amazing performer for the price and the drivers keep getting better.    I think with XeSS it is the best budget 1440p gaming card.   The only major issue is UE5 games not performing very well, but the drivers are improving.",Positive
Intel,"i will go with B580, save your money to buy something else, since you are playing FHD then yes B580 is a better value",Positive
Intel,"The biggest reason was the price, I saw an arc b580 for R$1800, compared to the 16g 9060xt which I was only finding for around R$2800",Neutral
Intel,$230 for that would be bad in the states but just depends what country you are in I guess.,Negative
Intel,i heard it was a pretty decent entry level card,Positive
Intel,"The B580 costs 330$, RTX 4060 costs 380$ and 6600 costs 270$.  (Ronded up/down currency conversions)",Neutral
Intel,"In the majority of countries you have to pay 20% more of the MSRP just in taxes alone, now add the importation costs and tariffs, that's not a bad price, considering there aren't many options around $20 in the GPU market.",Neutral
Intel,"It can run beamng drive, My igpu run the game at 20fps on lowest settings in 720p, and my rx580 sounded like a jet engine while running the game on medium settings.",Neutral
Intel,What country are you in?,Neutral
Intel,well i hope it does you wonders friend,Positive
Intel,Poland,Neutral
Intel,I love Poland!  I flew to Krakow to visit my family in Ostrava earlier this year. 🫡,Positive
Intel,"I'd go for the 7600x because that deal is crazy. Unless you have a pretty powerful gpu and high refresh monitor and want to target those ultra high frame rates, then the 7600x3d. I'd stay away from intel until they get there shit together.",Negative
Intel,What is specifically wrong with intel? I thought performance wise the 275kf out performs 7600X3D? I'm not playing on a high res screen either but I don't upgrade my pc often so I kind of want it too last another 6-8 years and will the 7600x be able to keep up?,Negative
Intel,"The 265k is outperformed or at best matches the 14 and 13600k in gaming. The 7600x3d is a few % below the 7800x3d and closer to the 700k models from 13 and 14th gen.    Is it fine, sure, but that x3d cache really helps on gaming.",Neutral
Intel,I see but isnt the productivity and multitasking much better for intel? So say im playing a game and i ahve steam open in the back with discord and google chrome would the intel outperform the ryzen? Not trying to argue just wondering whats best for me,Neutral
Intel,265k is a good chip but am5 will have better future upgradability.,Positive
Intel,Now we need Nvidia to fix its CPU overhead problem.. which it has had for the last 10+ years... here's hoping!,Neutral
Intel,Only for some games though,Neutral
Intel,"If you are a gamer dont buy ryzen 8000, that cpu is slower than 7500f in gaming since the lack of l3 cache. Just get b650 MB and something like 7500f/7600, the gpu is ok at the price but frankly slow for todays standards, if you have extra money buy better gpu. Also try to find 6000mhz cl30 ram, as its proven to be the best for am5 ryzens",Negative
Intel,is a ryzen 5 7600x better?,Neutral
Intel,"7500f, 7600, 7600x are all very similar and good options, 7600x might need better cooling because of higher TDP, if you are going with low tier gpu(the one you choose) it really doesnt matter, you can get 7500f",Positive
Intel,And with the Rx 9060 xt 8g graphics card?,Neutral
Intel,También se me olvidó decir que mi monitor es 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,"If you can get 9060xt 16gb it would be ideal, but 8gb is fine aswell",Positive
Intel,i'd go with the RX 9070 more VRAM better drivers better performance its more money but should last you longer,Positive
Intel,Bro that thing looks less like a PC and more like it’s about to open a portal to hell,Negative
Intel,9070!!,Positive
Intel,"If you can afford it, the 9070 is way faster than the B580. It's not even close. And I think pairing it with an 11700K is totally fine. That's still a decently fast CPU.",Positive
Intel,"That is legitimately one of the coolest PCs I've seen, such a shame it's nearing the end of it's life...  You BETTER build a worthy successor of it!!!",Positive
Intel,man i playing on 1440p and 4k on a 9070. get that and thank yourself.,Positive
Intel,"Glad to see people actually considering Intel GPUs. I hope they can catch up with Nvidia and AMD in terms of performance and compatibility.  That being said, I'd get the 9070.",Positive

Intel,Rip 🙏,Neutral
Intel,yeah i know some people still rocking 11th gen intel you should be fine with the new GPU now and then a full upgrade later,Neutral
Intel,You and me both,Neutral
Intel,with the 1050? fuck no,Negative
Intel,"Depends on your regional prices and the specific models. If you ignore the prices I would prioritize them like this: 5070ti > 9070xt = 7900xtx > 5070 > 9070. If you need the additional VRAM a 7900xtx is an easy pick, though I think their prices are a bit too high.",Neutral
Intel,"Awesome good to know, thanks 👍",Positive
Intel,No I'm replacing it. The 1050. With the 9070. Can my 11700K and ddr4 ram work with the 9070?,Neutral
Intel,"That's a pretty helpful way to visualize it. I'll probably wait for a deal/sale, I have a Micro Center 20 min away and just grab whatevers cheapest for now 🙏 thanks.",Positive
Intel,"that should be good depending on the game. cpu intensive games can be tough, but if youre planning on 1440p and/or 4k the gpu gets taxed alot more anyway. the 9070 is a great card, ive owned one for about 4 months now and im very impressed with it. theres some OC headroom too.",Positive
Intel,"Sounds great! If you are gaming on 1080p+high settings or 1440p+mid/high settings, consider the 9060xt 16gb. Not as powerful as the basic 9070 but it's an excellent price/performance card, that might get you faster to the 5090.",Positive
Intel,"[Test with an i7-13700 + ARC A770 at 1080p max settings](https://youtu.be/qOhaZFrMbKA?t=592) from a year ago. 65-70fps average seems about right. Not sure why you would run Fortnite at max settings tho, set a few things to medium or high, so you can get around 120-160fps.  And ""CPU utilization"" means nothing, you have to check if the individual cores are maxed out, games don't usually run on all cores. But GPU at 99-100%, means the GPU is limiting performance.",Neutral
Intel,"Trash gpu, expected performance.",Negative
Intel,It’s a pc I built to sell. I was just getting some benchmarks from low to high and noticed that with settings maxed the fps tanked,Neutral
Intel,"Also, I just recently did a Ryzen f5 7600 with a 12 gig 3060 and so much better performance so I assumed the Intel would do better with more chores than Fortnite being a CPU bound game.",Positive
Intel,"Yes, I did recheck that though and above 4g decoding. Also xmp enabled at 6000mhz",Neutral
Intel,"You cannot compare core count, clock speeds, compute units, or anything like that for different architectures, only way to know for sure is by running benchmarks.  An example of that is the recently release Arc B580. If you looked at the spec sheet for the A770 and the B580, the A770 seems much, much more impressive, [but in games, the B580 deliver much better performance](https://youtu.be/aV_xL88vcAQ?t=676) (and even better with the recent driver updates).",Neutral
Intel,"you need to replace the whole pc, since the i7 870 is not only old, but ancient in terms of pc specs.   that would mean new motherboard, new ram, new cpu cooler, likely also new power supply due to the age.   gpu would also need to be upgraded.   case could be reused if you want to make it a sleeper style pc build.",Neutral
Intel,"Buy a GPU now (recommended if you want immediate improvement picks to watch for in your price range:  Intel Arc B570 (excellent value on many 1080p titles and efficient ~130–140W cards), or good used cards such as GTX 1660 Super / RX 580 / RX 6600 if you find a trustworthy local seller. These will often let you play Rainbow Six Siege, Apex and CS at ~60 FPS on medium settings.   Why do this first? GPU gives the largest immediate FPS uplift per dollar in gaming. Even if the i7-870 bottlenecks some situations, many competitive games scale well with a stronger GPU at 1080p if you lower CPU-heavy settings (e.g., view distance / physics / background processes).",Positive
Intel,I need a CPU cooler anyway because I need to help it start spinning when starting the PC :)). Power supply is also quite new. So I need a new motherboard? Does it just not work with new components? What is the consequence of not buying one?,Neutral
Intel,Thanks. I probably won’t have enough money to buy more than one component per month anyway. So I will just buy that and see the result.,Neutral
Intel,your motherboard don't support a new enough cpu that wont bottleneck a newer more powerful gpu.   also your motherboard is running an old version of pcie called pcie 2. which will bottleneck any newer gpu heavily.,Negative

Intel,Damn not even testing 3000 series GPUs,Negative
Intel,"Ugh, one should NEVER post numbers with DLSS/FSR/XESS turned on (at least not as the ONLY numbers). It should be raw performance, and then people choose if they are willing to do upscaling after the fact.",Negative

Intel,Another game that requires DLSS and frame gen with almost every card to get 100+ FPS in 4K. Gotta buy a 5090 for native lol,Negative
Intel,"The worst part about DLSS is it obfuscates and reverses the typical order and language of upscaling. 4k ""performance"" is 1080p. A $1,000 GPU sitting at 84FPS at 1080p in 2025 is absurd and embarrassing",Negative
Intel,Not even a 3090ti?,Negative
Intel,So um where are my 5070=4090 numbers?,Neutral
Intel,"So \~117 FPS with DLSS on performance is ""running well"" now? But 100+ FPS with DLSS on performance was ""running like shit"" in Borderlands 4?",Negative

Intel,"Looks about right. Max settings/DLSS Quality/RT Off for me  HDR when enabled looks better than RT, without the performance cost.",Positive
Intel,Dunno if id consider sub 100 fps with dlss performance of all things on a 4090 running well.  I expect that kind of performance/fps out of dlss quality usually.,Negative
Intel,"I'm more or less fine with this Game's performance.  On native, I get around 60FPS with my 5070TI with Raytracing (HW Lumen) disabled. With DLSSQ I get around 80FPS up to 100FPS. With DLSSQ and FrameGen I'm at 140FPS or more. All in WQHD. Framegen also reduces (yes, you read that right) Latency by a big chunk because Reflex is activated with it. An option to disable Framegen and activate Reflex would be cool, tho. I modded it in with SpecialK, but not offering an Option in the settings is a huge miss from the Devs. That game has huge Latency Spikes (up to 100MS) and you can feel it drastically. So Reflex is a must even without FrameGen.  I settled to use FrameGen with a Reshade called Lillium HDR Reshade witch offers a Reshade to Sharpen the Game, so I don't have many troubles with ghosting from Framegen. I also installed a Mod Manager named UltraModManager that greatly buffs visuals and offers a fix for black floors (Color grading is a little bit off in games from those Devs). Right now I play with Game with 120FPS+ with DLSS Q and Framegen enabled but without much noticeable Ghosting and with decent Latency and HW Lumen enabled. If you like to Fiddle with UE and don't hesitate to install Mods, it's a great Game. The ""Basic"" experience is meh, tho. Not because of the lack of FPS, but because of that huge Latency thing.   I also gained huge performance increase just by downgrading my Driver to 572.83. Newest Driver has horrible micro stutters in my opinion.",Positive
Intel,"Just disable hw lumen and the game looks the same but with more fps, a lot more",Neutral
Intel,"Why was XeSS used on ultra quality instead of perf mode? One interesting thing I've noted is how 3000 series are getting slower and is consistent with Nvidia drivers where older GPUs, despite official driver support, always perform 10-15% worse even after taking Vram, bandwidth into account.",Negative

Intel,Another game when AMD does really good with RT enabled at 4K and at 1440p it's even better.,Positive
Intel,\> upscaling  can we stop turning upscaling into norm of gaming for modern high-end GPUs? upscaling should be used only on older hardware to get performance increase without having to sacrifice looks.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it runs well for me and looks gorgeous too. I love the intentionally clunky combat. I feel like sh2 combat was a bit too op. Like I could 1v3 mannequins with a pipe in my hand lmao. They toned it down well and the guns feel satisfying to use. Story so far is very mysterious and I am enjoying the buildup hope it delivers. That said the real standout to me is the combat and the atmosphere.,Positive

Intel,Be very curious how the 5070ti and the 9070xt stack up one another using the UEVR VR mod - but that might not be hardware that you can really use with UEVR on this game.,Neutral

Intel,The 3060 Ti was tested for 1440p.   Why they chose that card and that card only is beyond me.,Neutral
Intel,Lol no love for my 3070 Ti,Negative
Intel,100% agree,Positive
Intel,I 100% agree but it is funny seeing people over in r/hardware saying that since people use DLSS-Q/B/P that those should be the posted numbers.  In nearly every benchmark video post there is someone complaining which is sad.,Negative
Intel,"I can agree with both but upscaling is now an industry standard and those numbers are going to be more accurate for the majority.  Well unless you bought a $900 card that doesn't have access decent upscaling for some reason, but that would have been a silly choice.",Neutral
Intel,"If they turned ray tracing off (which is software then), it runs a lot better. Like… a lot.",Positive
Intel,"Native 4k gaming is pretty much dead, especially with ue5.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, my 17-30ish fps during the intro with my 4090 at native 4k with everything maxed out HURT. With DLSS and frame gen on, I get 50-60ish most of the time. Thankfully it actually looks great in this game.",Positive
Intel,Then you don't have a good enough CPU because it runs perfect on my 5090 native with a 9950x 3D,Neutral
Intel,Even that wouldn't do ;),Neutral
Intel,Wait. This says Ray tracing on. These numbers are fantastic lmao,Positive
Intel,A game that can run at 60+ 4k native on a 9070 XT which is quite far from being top of the line sounds excellent to me  (Edit) Is it native? Nothing in the images suggest it's not native but I don't actually know lmao,Positive
Intel,"To be fair, rtx is on too. With it off those numbers ar probably much higher",Neutral
Intel,"It’s not just the resolution taxing performance. Graphical settings such as lighting effects, reflections, shadows, etc. all play a role. Lowering the resolution is just one part of the equation when it comes to performance. You can lower everything down to medium and most likely  increase your frame rate more than just lowering the resolution.   Yes, a $1000 GPU should get better performance, but as how it’s always been with PC gaming: you want bleeding edge graphics, you take a bleeding edge performance hit, no matter what your hardware cost.   Is UE5 a mess? Yes, but so was UE4, which took years to get right.",Neutral
Intel,"Unfortunately, there is no ray tracing performance improvement in the 5000 series compared to the 4000 series. Ngreedia is too busy promoting DLSS tensor cores marketing garbage over raw GPU power. Raytracing should be the future not DLSS, which is just an over-glorified blurry TAA.",Negative
Intel,Ha,Neutral
Intel,If that's the case then overriding in the Nvidia app should get you the transformer model,Neutral
Intel,I heard through the interwebs that AMD is not good at Ray tracing. Outdated tales.,Negative

Intel,Honestly it's a perfectly fine card.,Positive
Intel,Or my 3090ti :(,Negative
Intel,It's nice to have both the pure native numbers and upscaling numbers to help consumers make a decision. It's not fun when either bit of information is left out. Just give us both numbers.,Neutral
Intel,it's so dumb since even nvidia cards with 1 generation difference can use different upscalers. And then you add AMD and intel to the mix. you're comparing upscaling software at this point,Negative
Intel,Dlss perfomance in qhd? Nobody's going to use that,Negative
Intel,It didn't exist for all that long. I played everything at 4K for 5 years on a 3080. There were only about two years where the hardware was sufficient before ray tracing became part of most AAA games and running at 4K required significant compromises.,Neutral
Intel,Sad but true. I usually don't go down to performance dlss unless I absolutely have to. It doesnt bother me as much in something like Marvel rivals for example. I noticed the game shimmered a fair bit even with dlss 4 balanced. Frame gen also cuts the 1% lows a fair bit which doesnt feel great.,Negative
Intel,meanwhile tekken 8,Neutral
Intel,"That cannot feel good, your input fps will be around 40. That would give you pretty high render latency. Id recommend dropping a few settings.",Negative
Intel,I'm running it in native and it's totally fine.,Positive
Intel,With performance upscaling... I use upscaling 95% of the time myself but would rather leave it at quality or balanced. Making perf the starting point is borderline disingenuous.,Negative
Intel,Exactly. Ray Tracing is ON,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah but with DLSS 4 Performance, I own a 4080 playing in both 1440p and 4k and those performances aren’t great. At least the 1% lows seems stable",Negative
Intel,"Text description in the post says it's FSR/DLSS performance. It's upscaled 4k.  It's not that bad. 9070 XT isn't supposed to be a 4k card and this is with Ray Tracing on. It could be a bit better though, and hopefully it will over time.  Edit: 1440p stays above 100FPS even in its 1% lows too.",Positive
Intel,Thanks man I had no idea resolution wasn’t the only factor.,Positive

Intel,But our current hardware is not good enough for AAAA games!,Negative
Intel,"It’s not that’s it’s not *valid*. They practically made it a *requirement*. It should be a helpful tool, not used to fix a lack of optimization.",Negative
Intel,It would be more accurate to say that poorly built software (UE5) can’t make the most of hardware that already exists.,Negative
Intel,"Arguing in favor of dlss will get you downvoted to oblivion by this subreddit that represents less than 0.01% of gamers. They'll all use it but also whine about it because it's the cool thing to do. Probably a good balance is to quantify the visual impact of dlss in conjunction. Though in almost every game dlss is so good now that u barely notice it. Visual artifacts from dlss are like nothing compared to the ridiculous amount of pop in and low quality lighting they seem to be fine with in older games.   So yes, most of these people will downvote you for using dlss in ur benchmarks even tho I think it's perfectly fine, be prepared for that.",Negative
Intel,"And FSR Performance being used on the other side, so I'm not sure what your point is?",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia has had a vram problem for a while now. It's great that the 5060 Ti has a 16gb variant, but they also have an 8gb variant....   Not to mention that the 5070 only has 12gb for some reason. You have to buy a 5070 Ti to get 16gb, when the Ti could have absolutely been 24gb.",Negative
Intel,"5080 being a 16 GB card is the biggest crime, least they could do was 18GB.",Negative
Intel,"The 3060 base model is the second most common card according to the Steam hardware survey results for this year. 3060 Ti is the 7th, 3070 is the 8th, 3060 mobile is 9th, and the 3080 is 18th.  If the 3060 Ti got included, I think they should have at least included the 3060 and 3070. Especially the 3070, which is a more capable card.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah honestly good budget option,Positive
Intel,You gonna be maxing out texture quality for a long time:),Positive
Intel,"Yes this, cuz right now there is a lot of narrative being pushed just to get clicks and we get presented with fake data.  I don’t think raster is a valid result, I mostly use dlss q on 1440p and ray tracing, while now “nvidia bad” narrative is going on, a lot of reviews just show raw performance no frame gen, no dlss and no RT, like whats the point?  And when cards were released all those same reviewers were hyping up frame gen and said how good it is and didn’t notice any issue until it was ramped to the max, so is it good or not? Are cards good or not?  I use frame gen on 3080ti with dlss on native and results are phenomenal in AC Shadows and Cyberpunk, so if it works that good on software level, I am convinced it works insanely well on 50 series which I will purchase when super cards come.",Negative
Intel,"I still decided to drop down from 4K to 1440p and turn off ray tracing. I just found the compromises you mentioned to be too much for both. 4K takes beastly power, and ray tracing guarantees you won't get great frames without DLSS.   I now live the high refresh, 1440p life. It's peaceful.",Negative
Intel,I don’t mind the upscaling but I have absolutely no interest in using frame gen. I don’t care for seeing higher numbers that aren’t actually real and make the game look worse.,Negative
Intel,esports titles usually have better performance than other games,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, thankfully due to the style and speed of the game, it doesn't feel too bad. It definitely isn't the best, but it's tolerable to me. It is a BEAUTIFUL game. It's just wild to me that even in places where you're basically only able to see where your flashlight is shining, the framerate is still rough lol",Positive
Intel,"He wanted 100+ fps in 4k, max settings at native. If you can do that with a 5090, that's awesome bro. I stand corrected. A 5080 can't do even 60 on some other games even including AW2.",Positive
Intel,And so is dlss performance. This is very flawed benchmark.,Negative
Intel,"So it's a little more performance on a 5090 than on Cyberpunk (Path tracing), which is not bad depending on what level of RT we're talking  is it full ray tracing or only select effects?",Positive
Intel,Isn't the game capped at 60fps? And aren't physics tied to this limit so unlocking it is janky?,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I totally agree.  But showing benchmarks with it isn't an affront to gamers,Neutral
Intel,"based on what? UE5 bad? I don't see other engines do much better, same thing with UE 4.27",Negative
Intel,"Hardware RT is On, which is pretty good in my opinion",Positive
Intel,"That ""runs well"" includes fg and dlss/fsr perf.  Yes, let's downscale 4k to 1080p, input fake frames and call it runs well",Neutral
Intel,"That's not a problem, that's being greedy. And 16gb 4060 and 5060 cost significantly more than 8gb variants. Last time they gave a budget card decent vram people bought and kept them, 3060 is still the most used gpu I think. Which hurt their greedy sales, so they went full ass.",Negative
Intel,hear me out: 5060 TI Super 24gb.,Neutral
Intel,"I understand what you mean, but does 2 gb really matter at this level? 8 to 12 is a significant 50% difference, but 16-18 is 12.5% increase.  What task will benefit from that? Because 18 isn't enough for AI and overkill for gaming.",Neutral
Intel,I didn't want to buy a new monitor. A 4K display running at 1440p looks worse than it does at 1080p.,Negative
Intel,Frame gen can look good if the input fps is decent.,Positive
Intel,"Everything max, even ray tracing at 4k, at 100+ frames per seconds is wild though.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm using g-sync so technically anything 40-180fps feels smooth.  Realistically anything 60-180 feels smooth.  Optimally 80-180fps is absolutely perfect.    I'd say I'm getting 70-140 range maxed out. DLSS quality puts me 90-160, so not worth it for the ghosting/shimmering during fast movement.",Positive
Intel,"Yes thats the only game that is stuck at 60 fps, I forgot to mention that. All though it is still mostly 60 fps at max settings 1080p upscaled to 1440p. Yeah also the UI goes crazy for unlocking the framerate",Neutral
Intel,If only stalker 2 gave us an option to use hardware RT which at times can be easier to run.,Neutral
Intel,"I meant a problem for the consumer. Nvidia absolutely did it on purpose, like you said.  There's a reason I bought a 16gb 9060xt and not a 5060 Ti. The value is worse for the Nvidia card, and that's including AMDs own problems.",Negative
Intel,"I don’t know about overkill tbh. More memory will allow you to use higher quality textures for a long time, if you’re the type to keep your card for a long time. Textures don’t hit gpu utilization much so it’s no problem in that regard. Even 2 GB would make a bit of difference and at least show that Nvidia is gimping vram less on their high end cards.",Neutral

There were no AI tools to help smooth the pain.   I know all the arguments for DLSS / FG / VRR etc. so not trying to start a word-war here, just saying that buying a 5070 today is not what buying a GTX970 or 2070 was back in the golden days ;)  If one has to still think about sliders in games with a $2000 GPU, we are not doing something right.",Negative

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.

Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios).

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive

Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive

Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative

Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral

Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

Intel,">AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs  AMD doesn't need to make ""Monster"" class APUs as they cater to the x86 desktop market where they make ""Monster"" dGPUs which can be upgraded independently.   And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo.

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.

I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing.

Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables.

So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise.

At some point GPUs will be so powerful and game engines will have RT in the bag that RT will be used in basically all indie games...and then suddenly nobody will talk about RT anymore because RT is in everything for years.",Positive
Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral
Intel,Don't forget about Frame Gen too. IMO that's the worst part because that means it's 30 fps without it. Imagine the input latency...,Negative
Intel,The actual true crime here is even having fsr to begin with. It should just have dlss,Negative
Intel,Seems like they tried to cover every basis with these.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah it's kinda weird, even games that had a massive difference of performance when using dual channel RAM never listed it on their requirements :/",Negative
Intel,"I've noticed that many developers do this, for some reason developers seem to have some kind of secret passion for the 1070 lol",Positive
Intel,It's because the minimum settings is with software RT enabled and thus they're using the fastest cards without hardware RT that can reach 1080p30 FSR2.,Neutral
Intel,"GCN support is over, RDNA1 is the lowest currently supported arch.",Negative
Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.   Either the game runs like shit on AMD hardware, or the system requirements are wrong and they just write down the components that they tested with.   Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative
Intel,"They're not, those are the cheapest/slowest GPUs that have 8 GB of VRAM. Clearly game devs are done pandering to people who bought Nvidia's e-waste.",Negative
Intel,What do you mean forced raytracing?,Neutral
Intel,1440 + upscaling looks better than 1080p because you're on a 1440 resolution monitor.   Do you even 1440p?,Positive
Intel,"Honestly RT has a lot of fluff and the majority of which is the most costly for the least amount of noticeable fidelity increase. Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt. If games only leverage certain aspects of RT then the performance is still comparable, that's also why the 3080 and 6800XT perform similarly in Fortnite with full RT/nanite/lumen settings.",Neutral
Intel,It's actually 960p :(,Negative
Intel,"can advertize pushing all the triangles and RT if you dont stick with a low resolution, certain things launched WAY before they should have in the consumer space.",Neutral
Intel,Support FSR3.0 and being able to use FSR3.0 at launch gives me a bit of skepticism lately,Neutral
Intel,We'll see in a year.,Neutral
Intel,AFAIK  &#x200B;  It is with RT,Neutral
Intel,Seems pretty good to me given it is at 4K with RT,Positive
Intel,"Likely includes the RT features , its also 4k",Neutral
Intel,"Its ubishit, what do u expect, however, since the game has RT reflections, shadows and GI, then i would say this is based on AMD shit RT performance, so lets wait and see how the 4080 is gonna perform.",Negative
Intel,"I wouldn’t mind so much if it was exclusively a 4K thing, but now devs are leaning on upscaling *at 1080p*, where it still objectively looks like ass and blurs everything in the background.",Negative
Intel,"Everyone asked for this. ""iTs tHe fuTuRe"".  ""LoOks bEtTeR tHan nAtiVe"". ""BiGgeR nUmBeR bEtTer"".",Negative
Intel,and we were called [names that frankly should have resulting in bans] when we said this is where it would lead to. and we still get shat on for saying the same about fake frames,Negative
Intel,"I think the top right table is listing the available features/settings the game supports. Depending on the presets, RT may be enabled by default or it may be a separate option from the presets. I guess we'll find out.",Neutral
Intel,"Nothing will stop DLSS / FSR nor RT in new games at this point.  The problem with the rising hardware requirements is, that it will keep a lot of 1440p/4k dreaming gamers with 1080p for a very long time and FSR doesnt really look good enough in 1080p.",Negative
Intel,I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.,Neutral
Intel,Exactly! It even got xess so Intel users also can use xess,Positive
Intel,">Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. T  its not much different for consoles , like alan wake 2 uses Low to mid settings and FSR balanced on PS5 even on switch titles use scaling and no man sky even FSR and stuff.",Negative
Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative
Intel,"How so? The 4080 and 7900xtx are neck in neck, same as the 6800 and 3080.",Neutral
Intel,"It's 4k, it will take another 5-8 years to be mainstream.  1440p slowly creeping to 10% marketshare give it another 2-3 years to be mainstream",Neutral
Intel,"Consoles use fsr as well, and not just fsr but often at low precision making the upscale rougher. Its an industry wide trend.",Neutral
Intel,">what a shame pc gaming has become.  Could be worse , Consoles use mostly FSR balanced like in Alan wake 2 the PS5 uses Low to mid settings and FSR balanced.  its likely the trend of going from specially home made engines  catered to the games needs to "" Can do everything , but nothing great"" multi tool engines like UE.",Negative
Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative
Intel,"Absolutely agreed my friend. Time to leave pc gaming and focus on building yourself. The gaming industry is corrupted to the extreme, and will continue to do so as long as players continue to praise lazy developers. In the pussy that whole shit.",Negative
Intel,"Mirage is PS4 game, Avatar is PS5",Neutral
Intel,"Update: I must've read that wrongly somewhere! Apparently, it uses their own Snowdrop Engine 😳  Well AC: Mirage is nowhere near a next-gen game. Avatars of Pandora, on the other hand, uses Unreal Engine 5 with hardware ray tracing. So it's only natural it needs more horse power. But it'll look 10x better than AC: Mirage. So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Positive
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative
Intel,Kind of a messed up opinion.  Maybe games don't look much better than PS4 on your PC but they sure as hell do on mine and that would still be true at a lower resolution and framerate.,Negative
Intel,Ubisoft no longer employs achievements on new titles.  Don't get your hopes up.,Negative
Intel,Try ubisoft achievements :),Positive
Intel,"It's doing rt at all levels and 4k? Ye... It isn't mainstream yet, heck 1440p is like At 10% market share",Neutral
Intel,"Iam using afmf daily, the input lag introduced by afmf is between 5-12 ms for me.  Doubt any can literally feel this.  I have afmf enabled in all possible games & emulators.  If you think it's bad for you, you don't need to use it",Negative
Intel,Pretty much yeah... Was inevitable that Devs will use up scaling as excuse.  Same for taa being a absolute shoddy aaatleast up scalers do better aa :/ . But even consoles run now heavy fsr like the PS5 uses fsr balanced on WLAN wake on mostly low settings,Negative
Intel,We don't know the settings.  If its like cyberpunk psycho rt on release which 3080 and 3090 easily needed dlss balanced or performance for on 1440p and 4k...    Then I can see the same case in this game for 4080 and similar cards  Also they dont speak about frame gen just fsr2 ( which doesn't exist here because they support fsr3 which does up scaling and frame gen it's not split like dlss 2 & 3),Neutral

Intel,"Really comes up to how far the rt and lumen stuff can be pushed, if it goes to cyberpunk psycho rt levels? At release it needed a 3080 and 3090 with dlss.   So it could need top end gpu of this gen if its a similar case",Neutral
Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.  They got anyway already confused with fsr3 and fsr2 ( cause 3 is fsr frame gen and up scaling it's not like dlss where 2 is up scaling and 3 is frame gen)",Negative
Intel,Very similar performance I guess,Neutral
Intel,Ye,Neutral
Intel,They've been using it since forever. The difference is that PC GPUs were 10x faster than console GPUs so there was no need for it on PC.,Neutral
Intel,"It mentions dlss, fsr3 and xess support, doubt they limited it to dlss2.",Neutral

Intel,Honestly... Maybe fsr3 frame gen can help you but... A 3300 Was already outdated when it came out.,Negative
Intel,Most likely the upgrade part called FSR 2 and the frame creation part called FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,If they didnt get confused between FSR 3 and 2 then yes fsr 3 roughly doubles fps same for AFMF.,Neutral
Intel,"Nah usually enthusiast in hardware did mean "" max settings no compromises high frames"" but let's say... This changed the last 3 gens sadly.",Negative
Intel,"with AFMF it works , didnt test with FSR3 now.",Neutral
Intel,Reading before raging :),Positive
Intel,"It is even low quality with 30fps and still needs 5700 ~~XT~~. That is pretty bad :D  *Corrected to 5700, which I think is still a lot for FSR2 at low fullHD, but definitely cheaper GPU.",Negative
Intel,That's with 5700 and 1070.... WHAT exactly are you expecting those cards to do in visually demanding AAA titles in 2023?  People have some crazy expectations. Everyone wants the eye candy but no one wants to pay the performance cost.,Negative
Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Negative
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral
Intel,"dlss looks better than native with TAA because taa is so bad, but dlaa/fsraa at native >>>> upscaling",Negative
Intel,you think engine devs can pressure AMD and even Nvidia? Come on man. Be real.,Negative
Intel,"Ever notice how multi-GPU vanished the moment DX12 shifted the onus from AMD/Nvidia over to the developers?

Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Neutral
Intel,speaking facts my guy,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't have downvote dood wtf redditors ?,Negative

Intel,"Uhm, me btw...",Neutral
Intel,"> Who actually plays games at native these days, if it has upscaling?  I do.",Neutral
Intel,"I won't judge your preferences, but at least using native rendenring isnt the clown show we have here. Native 4k look the same no matter what gpu render it (performances aside). Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.  RT is the future because there are scenarios that rasterized rendering is just not capable of resolving. Screen space reflection artifacts, light leaking, weird glow on indirectly lit models... I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Neutral
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative
Intel,Or the game performs at 50 fps at 1080p low on 5700 but 50fps is a weird number to target and they can't say 60 so they just say 30fps and call it a day.,Negative
Intel,Not if it's using mesh shaders like Alan wake. In that game the GTX 1650 outperforms the 1080ti.,Neutral
Intel,The game is raytracing only with a ridiculous ammount of foooliage.,Negative
Intel,"I'm so glad this is finally getting more main stream spotlight.

Intel,i wonder when dual rank and dual channel will start being listed too. since dual rank does help gaming,Neutral
Intel,Honestly my 1070 still runs great for what it is. It’s in my sons rig now because it couldn’t keep up with 1440p depending on the game and definitely not 4k. Still a fairly solid 1080p card.,Positive
Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Negative
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral

Intel,Completely agree.,Positive
Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral
Intel,"Sometimes the DigitalFoundry reviewers use their meme powers for good (eg:fighting shader compilation stutter), but their  >""it's better than native!""   memeing about upscaling seems to have gone sideways.",Negative

Intel,">I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.  Facepalm...  Avatar Frontiers of Pandora very literally uses a custom engine, not Unreal Engine.",Neutral
Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Positive
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,"Next gen seems promising so far, low native rez hidden by upscaling, 60 FPS target on +500$ GPUs, traversal stuttering thanks to the glorious UE5. But hey, we have great reflections on puddles so at least we can take good looking screenshots.",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Negative
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Negative
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Positive

Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative

Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD.

It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral

Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Negative
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Negative
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Negative
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral

Intel,r/FuckTAA,Negative
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral

So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Negative
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative

Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

Intel,"Does this fact really matter tho? Dlss in cyberpunk is known the look on par or even better than native, frame generation will further smooth it out.

But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Positive
Intel,"Did you try DLSS?  Imagine getting down voted for asking if he was using DLSS. What a fragile community. Sometimes it's okay to use DLSS, other times you better not or people will come to your house with torches",Negative

Intel,"Someone ate up the marketing. I often see people wonder why games are so unoptimized today, your answer is right here. \^",Negative
Intel,All graphics you see on your computer screen is fake,Negative
Intel,Path tracing is more demanding than Ray tracing,Negative
Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Positive
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral

Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Positive
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative

Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive

Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative

Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive

Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative

Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral

Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative
Intel,Intel design will be a little bit different as far as now.  If I understood it right AMD chiplets communicate via lines on pcb but Intel wants to make something like chip-on-a-chip.,Neutral

Intel,"There is a lot of room for improvement, both in the software and future generations of hardware.  It's coming along though!  Overdrive mode looks nice, but there's just a lot more ghosting than the regular RT mode.",Positive
Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative
Intel,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,Positive
Intel,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, better graphics costs performance. SHOCKING",Negative

Intel,It’s not way slower. I get 110 FPS at 4k with all DLSS settings turned on and honestly it’s insane.,Positive

Intel,Nvidia fanboys being happy with fake frames and fake resolution will never not be funny to me.,Negative
Intel,What? I thought amd was always more tuned to raster as opposed to reflections,Neutral
Intel,Which is why nvidia is rabidly chasing AI hacks,Negative
Intel,This and rumors are saying that the 5090 is gonna be 50-70% faster than 4090 which wont be enough for native 4k either.,Negative
Intel,Say that to the people playing upscaled games at 4k (540p) on PS5.,Neutral
Intel,"I understand some RT effects might not catch everyones eyes, but seriously, path tracing cyberpunk vs 0 RT cyberpunk IS a big difference",Neutral
Intel,Huh? [Watch this is in 4K on a big screen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7_eHxfBsHQ&lc=UgyO2vRiSI6CRU5kYmV4AaABAg.9uyI5P8oamz9uylTN_rdmL) The differences are really apparent in each version.,Neutral
Intel,"PT looks way better in the game to me - it makes everything in the environment have a more natural look to it.  It adds, not ruins it...",Positive
Intel,"That's how I feel as well. It looks awesome don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look like cyberpunk to me.",Negative
Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, Alan Wake 2 is also releasing with path tracing so my guess is we're definitely gonna see more games featuring heavier RT, although not necessarily path tracing due to the performance hit.",Neutral
Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral
Intel,Raytracing now is a gimmick *  ( * - in AMD sponsored games where RT effects are so tiny you have to zoom on to notice them),Negative
Intel,"Except this is a tech demo. CP77 has lots of cut corners to achieve that, NN was trained to keep the interface stable in that game and even then, ray reconstruction creates horrible artifacts at some angles and distances. And that's with Ngreedia's engineeers literally sitting at CDPR's office.",Negative
Intel,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,Neutral
Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative
Intel,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,Neutral
Intel,"Don't forget that all NPCs will be controled by AI to simulate a real life.  They'll wake up in the morning, shower, commute to work, work, then go home.  All this to do it over and over and over until they die...  mhhh... this is kinda sad to type out.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)",Negative
Intel,It absolutely is. I’ve been playing at 1440p with DLSS Balanced and Ray Reconstruction and it is absolutely the worst version of DLSS I’ve ever seen. It’s basically unusable.,Negative
Intel,There are horrible artifacts with RR. And ghosting. It replaces artifacts with different ones. Needs a lot more work tbh. Or training.,Negative
Intel,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",Negative
Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped. Remember using artic solver ceramique instead of as5 due to it potentially not degrading as fast as well.   Good times =)",Negative
Intel,"Yea same here, didn't play crysis until I got a hold of a 260 after having 2 8600gt's in sli. Played mostly wow at the time and those 2 8600gt's in sli got blown away by the gtx 260, but man that card was hot!  Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it. Ended up turning off tessellation cause it hit the card too hard, least until I got a second 570 in sli, which sadly died like a year later due to heat while playing Shadow Warrior.",Positive
Intel,Q6600 was the bomb. I ran mine at 3.0GHz all its life and it's still alive today. Had it paired with an 8800GT which was IMO one of the best GPU value/performance of all time.,Positive

Intel,> I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.  In those days I was a broke teenager and I remember upgrading to a GTS250(rebadged 9800GTX+ with more vram) and crysis still hammered my Athlon x4 965(?) system.

Unsurprisingly it's in a laptop that I bought during the [illegal GeForce Partner Program](https://hothardware.com/news/nvidia-geforce-partner-program) before the public knew about the program.  Not making that mistake again.  Screw NVIDIA.  Every other card I've ever gotten has been ATI/AMD (and obviously the low-end integrated Intel GPUs on some office laptops)  EDIT: Keep them downvotes coming.  You've all been bullshitted by NVIDIA's marketing.  Your boos mean nothing; I've seen what makes you cheer.,Negative
Intel,Anyone who owns an Nvidia GPU should be ashamed of themselves tbh.,Negative
Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, but not after Nvidia bought Ageia.",Neutral
Intel,"If the $200 cards of today aren't 3x better than the flagship cards of 10 years ago (they're not), then you shouldn't expect a $200 card in 2033 to be 3x faster than an RTX 4090. Average annual performance gains are more likely to decrease between now and then, rather than increase.",Negative
Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Positive
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

Intel,"Until the next generation of consoles, I think path tracing will be added to something like a couple major games per year with Nvidia's help. If I'm right, that's wouldn't be a lot, but it's definitely be a bonus for those who have GPUs that are better at ray tracing.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090).

Intel,"Both DLSS and FSR have weird image artifacts (FSR is worse though) so i guess if you don't see them then DLSS only works in your favor then.  I personally want as little noticeable image artifacts from DLSS/FSR when I play so opt for native resolution, generally.",Negative
Intel,Have you tried dlss quality. Dlss balanced sacrifices image quality and dlss quality doesn't/can enhance it sometimes,Negative
Intel,">a lot of the comparisons just make it look like it gives too much bloom  This is due to colors being compressed to SDR. In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now. It's something like when you get a high refresh screen and can't look back at 60Hz anymore.",Negative

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Intel,"Anyone can say anything.  Anyone can change their intent after the fact.  Happens all the time.   Judge them by their actions alone and ignore what they say.

It's not conclusive, but I'm not going to rely on any company's PR statements to sway me one way or another because they will (obviously) say whatever they're able to prevent lawsuits and public image damage.

They likely can't tell what cause the feeling to begin with even if they can notice it.     But everyone can instantly judge how real something looks, which is the go-to standard for ""good"".

It's like teaching a kid how to illustrate shadows on an ball vs the how light actually works. Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful. There's just not enough information for them to look correct, just enough to trick you when you're not really paying attention.",Negative

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive

Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no.

Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral

Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral

Intel,"It really is a mess, someone should've been fired long ago.",Negative
Intel,Intel wasn't a static target since the 10th gen. They've been pushing (at least in terms of performance) since then. It's mostly the efficiency which stepped back. And they messed up their current lineup in terms of performance and pricing but they've improved for sure.  Next gen seems good for them though. Hope they price it well. AMD isn't zen 1/2 either. They're bumping core numbers too and introducing some new cores as well.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, why?  Is AMD going to be coming out with anything more powerful than the HX 370 in that power range?",Neutral
Intel,because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 50% more performance.,Neutral
Intel,"There are so many variables here that we have no way of accurately saying that.  It's possible that Xe3 is simply treated more like RDNA in this benchmark, and that the Xe2 140V is unfairly biased towards in that way. If that is the case, the 890M and 8060S may be better metrics to base off, and we do see over 50% gains for a 50% wider GPU than the 890M.  It's also possible this is a power-limited scenario. Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.  This could be pre-release drivers not getting the true 100% out of the hardware or silicon with non-final clocks still being tuned. The point is there's no way to know for sure.",Neutral
Intel,I don’t understand why you people continue to use that MSI claw to demonstrate “intel improved lunar lake performance post launch” when there are millions of lunar lake laptops that never had performance issue of that one handheld.,Negative
Intel,"they're keeping their jobs because this is technically better than the past. back in the day you'd have model numbers exclusive to a retail store, much less specific to an OEM, because businesses wanted to feel like they got a bespoke deal.   These days the SKU naming is mostly for accounting purposes, while the ""real"" naming decisions are made by the OEMs. basically most people are buying the Thinkpad/Yoga/ROG ""brand"" rather than the specific processor model, which only a much smaller crowd bothers to comprehend. It's like how people buy the Steamdeck rather than whatever APU is in there, which is fairly old at this point.",Neutral
Intel,"Energy efficiency is huge in mobile but I was explicit in saying they were no longer a static target in graphics, where they were not making significant or impressive gains in iGPUs for many years, it seemed. Now they are making one of the best iGPUs on the market.",Positive
Intel,"Possibly yes.   Current AMD handheld chips are better than Lunar Lake performance. Assuming normal cadence. Next generation would be similar performance to Panther Lake.     I was hoping more of a leap frog, rather than similar performance. %50 would be a very clear edge.",Positive

Intel,"As weird as it sounds actually Lunar Lake improvement mainly comes from MSI Claw not laptop, that because majority people who use MSI Claw give feedback the most which is why Intel focusing on the handheld first then laptop.    Intel even use Claw as benchmark for Lunar Lake compared to laptop. You can read from this article :  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/   Also Claw got BIOS update way faster than any laptop with the same chip so it helps Intel to mitigate power and boost behavior to maximize the performance. There is so many bug reports on Arc forum, most of them are Claw users, that's why laptop got benefits too.",Positive
Intel,"Mostly because people with LNL laptops are less likely to games since gaming are not the point of those laptops -> less testing, whereas the Claw 8 AI+ is a gaming PC handheld, so it is mostly use for gaming purpose and thus have more people testing for its performance.",Neutral

Intel,I have no idea.,Neutral
Intel,"We don't know what TDP was run here, and both MTL amd ARL H have been 28W outside of the Ultra 9 SKUs. It's entirely possible this was run at 28W, which is also in reach of Lunar Lake's boost envelope.",Neutral
Intel,"And is there documented so-called “large” performance improvements on LNL systems that already performed as expected on day one (it tied 890m on high power and was always better at low power, talking about real games not 3dmark)? Or was it only bringing the Claw back to where LNL should always perform?",Neutral
Intel,The lunar lake laptops are tested by reviewers all the same as the strix point ones.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal. Both frequency and sequential optimizations (like multi-level branch prediction) scale poorly.  Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though. So seeing the benefits to E cores for gaming requires 1.) e-cores exist for a while 2.) some games optimize for them.  Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Negative
Intel,It's either N3P or 18AP.,Neutral

Intel,"Really should focus on the Main/Sub thread part. Most games will usually only load up 1-3 cores, with the rest of the cores only used for incidental workloads with lower priority and sync requirements (Multithreading is hard yo, Multithreading with latency requirements is mindnumbing).  This makes plenty of games very suitable for the P/E architecture, as long as you have enough P cores for the Main threads, the E cores will be perfectly sufficient.",Neutral

Or if your 16 threads are on one die and any spillover has to go across the SoC die like with AMD and probably Nova Lake.",Neutral

Intel,">Starfield  [Not really](https://youtu.be/BcYixjMMHFk?t=1015), game doesn't benefit from more cores/threads.  >Bannerlord  Sadly, there's no benchmarks of different CPUs that I could find for this specific game, but I do know that this game heavily relies on a good CPU, but without decent data(review), which shows multiple CPUs tested, it's hard to understand the benefits of more cores/threads,  >UE5 games due to how the rendering pipeline works  It's true that UE5 can utilize 8 cores / 16 threads, but more than that? I'm not sure, if possible, provide a review/video which shows that UE5 scale with more cores/threads, so far, it seems that it is limited at 8c/16t - big channels rarely add UE5 games to their CPU benchmarks, but I found Remnant 2,[ and it doesn't show any benefits](https://youtu.be/3n537Z7pJug?t=1056) of more than 8 cores.  I heard that ""games are getting more multithreaded"" like 4-5 years ago, and in most cases, it wasn't true, with more than 8c/16t almost no games scale on CPU-side, and even when they do, in most cases it's a minor improvement over 8c/16t configuration, like 1-3%.",Negative
Intel,"UE5 by default does not support multithreading well. actually I don't think async shader is even considered a default feature yet despite being added two years ago. Only the editor compilation step uses all threads, but it doesn't need to react to user input so it would be more surprising if it didn't use all threads.  If you're seeing good thread use in a UE5 game is thanks to the developer breaking up work with their own engine changes.",Negative

Intel,Huh????,Neutral
Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral

Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.

Intel,"No I'm talking about the internal game benchmarks they shared. Yeah the GPU architecture  itself is a lot better on paper, but they probably got bottlenecked by the low bandwidth of 128-bit LPDDR5. The uplift in 1% lows in some titles is impressive though.   [power-efficient-gaming-26.jpg (2133×1200)](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/intel-panther-lake-technical-deep-dive/images/power-efficient-gaming-26.jpg)  And yeah I'd not be surprised if 4 Xe3 is going to be closer to the 8 Xe2 in LNL than people would expect.",Neutral
Intel,Well it's not out yet so these are just predictions. Better to be conservative with estimates than overpromise.,Neutral
Intel,"We already knew they cancelled desktop variants though, Panther lake was going to be around Arrow Lake laptop performance no matter what.",Neutral
Intel,"If people can get a XX60ti level iGPU in a laptop, which means you don't have to worry about MUX switches (hardware or software), possibly have a cheaper platform (if scaled) since you don't need a separate GPU board, have access to a ton of RAM (many mid-range GPUs are RAM limited), and due to reduced complexity and the ability to better dynamically manage power can get a more effective slim chassis with less throttling... then yeah, it'd be pretty good.  The next big jump is LPDDR6 which looks to potentially hit a 50% bandwidth increase and marginally lower latency.  Combine that with a wide bus and you're looking at enough to power a XX70 series mobile chip.  The framework is immature but it could be competitive in the future.  We'll see!",Positive
Intel,"Buddy, that's 140V with optimizations. They are telling you what they have done to further optimize their graphics, including drivers and power management. and that they'll further apply this in the future. Did you really look at the slide?",Neutral
Intel,"This benchmark has nothing to do with panther lake, it's about the effect of their power management software on lunar lake before and after it is applied.",Neutral

Intel,\>HUB  That's shovelware and I'm not clicking that shit.,Negative
Intel,"They've tested it with just three AMD cpus. Weird pairings. I would pair B580 with any i5 from last couple years. Seriously their testing is getting less and less ""real life"" and more for the purpose of a good clickbait.",Negative
Intel,"I couldn’t believe the video I was watching, the thumbnail was pure clickbait. They fixed one game, and improved some others a little.  And NEVER an Intel CPU in sight. I like the B580, but it deserves better ""testing"" than this.",Negative
Intel,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Negative
Intel,"Is this related to historically Intel compiler not compiling code efficiently for AMD cpus? Does it also make Intel CPUs overhead better? If yes, then they really fixed something. If no, then they wrote code normally for AMD cpus as well as Intel cpus.",Neutral
Intel,"the B580 is a modern gpu, it should be paired with a modern cpu, preferably an Intel one, going with old school Ryzen cpus is a bad path to take.",Negative
Intel,"The problem is that this title makes it sound like they fixed the cpu overhead issue in every game, but that's not the case. Some games are still affected. Obviously any fix is better than nothing, but depending on what games you want to play, you will still see an overhead issues. It is nice though that in some of the games the overhead problem has been addressed though.",Negative
Intel,"Haven't watched the video, but damn.   If rue, HUB has officially become clickbait garbage. Not outright lying, but intentionally conveying misleading half-truths. Starting at least with the AMD fine wine video.",Negative
Intel,"It's meant to test low end, mid and high end.",Neutral
Intel,"The exact CPU model is hardly relevant. The point was to show CPUs of a certain power level. Not sure how this makes it less ""real life"" as if all three CPUs shown weren't extremely popular for their time. Also not sure what one would achieve when using Intel CPUs specifically.",Negative
Intel,"These guys absolutely *refuse* to test with an Intel CPU, it's very weird.",Negative
Intel,"5700x would have made a lot of sense compared to 5600  12400f,13400f should be included as well",Neutral
Intel,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Negative
Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.      I would very much like to see the comparison   i5-12400, i5-13400, i5-13500, Ryzen 5 5600(X)",Positive
Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render. (at least as far as my debugging could lead me)  (that's also why its less impacted on ddr5 systems no matter what CPU),Neutral
Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative
Intel,"No, B580 also performed poorly on i5-8400 and 10400 (both are 5600X-esq)",Negative
Intel,"The driver compiler is for GPU, not CPUs.",Neutral
Intel,9800X3D is the fastest CPU for gaming on the market. The usage of Intel or AMD CPUs doesn't inherently matter.,Positive
Intel,It's been official for awhile. Funny how it takes a positive Intel title for people to realize.,Neutral
Intel,Do you have peer-review data that disputes the data they presented?  Their video covers the scope of what got fixed.,Neutral
Intel,Welcome to the age of influencers...,Neutral
Intel,That's not how CPUs work in games.,Negative
Intel,Then they optimized drivers.,Neutral
Intel,Do you have peer-review data that confirms it?,Neutral
Intel,The video shows the B580 not having driver overhead issues with the 5600X but we don't know if it did previously on anything other than Spider-Man. His tone suggests the 5600X performance used to be worse but he provides no data other than Spider-Man to suggest it was for other games.,Neutral
Intel,The fact that a switch from a 5600 to a 5700 with hardly a frequency gain eliminates the overhead issue suggest that is kind of  how games/drivers work.,Neutral
Intel,Which also fixed performance on 5600X,Neutral
Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees. AKA you can have mainthread use 100% of core 0, but cores 1,2,3,4,5 are all 50% used, leaving 50% for other tasks to run freely.",Neutral
Intel,"Eventually you get the drivers where they need to be. People love to whine about Arc drivers but on the iGPU side people never complained. The community is never, ever happy with anything. Focusing their eggs on the Higher performance parts and then a slower LTS cadence keeping the old stuff alive is the right move.",Negative
Intel,"They will update, just not day 1 for certain games. Who's playing with integrated graphics?",Neutral
Intel,"cant say i blame them for scaling down driver updates for pre-arc graphics hardware, ever since they announced intel was getting into gpus proper ive been wondering how long it would take before this happened.  lets be honest no one was needing monthly igpu updates for 2021 hardware that was so underpowered it couldnt even tie with a GT1030 ^(\[why does everything come back to 14nm\].)",Negative
Intel,Running an N97 Mini PC with integrated and noticed the recent driver branching. I'm still impressed that Star Trek Online is playable on it.,Positive
Intel,Developers have been complaining about iGPU drivers for years. Matrix multiplications in OpenGL driver are still broken on a lot of integrated chips. It's driving me nuts every time I get a user report. 😭,Negative

There are 8760 hours in a year. 8760 hours / 83.3333 hours is 105  105\*.17 = $17.87. Meaning, if this card were to run year round non stop at idle, it would cost you $17.87.

Intel,"> I mean the price had skyrocketed as well  This is actually not true. As someone who wanted to buy a b580 for a rly long time but only for msrp, the card took like almost 9 months to hit msrp. I was watching it for a while and I did not feel like paying above msrp for it. Like until a few weeks ago all the ones available were like 50+ dollars over msrp. Now you can actually buy one for msrp at multiple places which is a good thing.   > How much of the problem would you say has been solved since release  The overhead problem hasn't been solved. I don't even think intel can fix it or has any interest in fixing it as they knew about it since december of last year and nothing has come out to try fix it. How big a problem is really dependant on what games you wanna play. It can only be like a 5% overhead issue which still puts it faster than the 4060 and 7600 but theres some games where it's like 20% or more where you have to have a very strong cpu to not see the overhead.  Do some research on the games you play and that will tell u whether to buy a b580 or a 9060 xt.

Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

The prebuilt eGPUs with a 7600 XT are decent. Only 8GB RAM, but the 7600XT easily beats the B50 Pro and 3050 at GB6 with scores of 83093 and 99525. But... it's $550-$600 for these. They aren't upgradable. And that 8GB of RAM is rough.  And sure, the Ryzen AI 395 with the Radeon 8060S is really solid... but Mini PCs with that are at least $1000, and that's getting a whole new machine. Thunderbolt 3+/USB4 ports are now quite common.

AMD,Is Zen 6 expected to be a big change from Zen 5? Or is it mainly a core count increase?,Neutral
AMD,"The question is whether Zen 7 will be on AM5. Given AMD have upgraded their IO die every two generations, and Zen 6 is rumored to continue this trend with a major revision, I think it's possible that Zen 7 will use the same IO die, which would imply it will not be compatible with DDR6 or PCIe 6.0, so maybe Zen 7 will be on AM5 too?",Neutral

AMD,Anybody excited to see the new ways motherboard manufacturers are going to brick the next generation of cpus?,Positive
AMD,"Good. Now if AMD could confirm something like : Zen 6 will support high speed DDR5 no problem and use all the bandwidth effectively, thatd be nice.  24 cores Zen 6X3D with 8-12 channels of CUDIMM DDR5-10500+ with 1TB+ of RAM support with RDNA5 APU on board for AI would be pretty freaking glorious.",Positive
AMD,I'm glad I didn't upgrade my 7800X3D to a 9800X3D.,Positive
AMD,"Now we only need for a Zen 7 on AM5 confirmation.   I am on a R5 7600 so I plant to, if Zen 7 AM5 is real, to upgrade to the 12 core X3D variant once AM6 releases; and ride that till AM7.",Neutral
AMD,Will this work on my x370? 😂,Neutral
AMD,"Selfishly, I was low-key hoping that Zen6 would be on AM6 so I could uprgade onto a start-of-life socket, but I guess DDR6 is a pre-requisite for a new socket and it's just not there yet.  Oh well, this ol' 5800X can just keep on trucking a while yet.",Negative

AMD,looking how people whined and bitched about DDR5 for AM5 (despite the fact that at that point DDR5 was already well established and hte prices rapidly dropping towards ddr4 levels) its really the only choice.,Negative
AMD,The question is whether AM6 launches in 2028 with Zen 7 or does AMD wait till 2030 with Zen 8.,Neutral
AMD,"There's a reason I think there's at least another gen of AM5 after this, if not two. If cached AM5 gives decent results, let Intel be the lab rat and just move up the sced for making 3d a standard feature and get CAMM2 debugged. Just because AM6 will be ready in 2028, doesn't mean DDR6 will.",Neutral
AMD,"Well IO die is likely to change so yes it should be a decent change. I'd expect better memory subsystem performance,",Positive
AMD,"Aside from the other things mentioned, a new infinity fabric interconnect packaging technique like was used in strix halo.  Enables higher speeds at lower power.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen 6 is N2. It's basically two node jumps.  Quite a big improvement on just the process alone, even if there aren't large IPC gains",Positive
AMD,"Mainly the core count and a big node jump, but if I had to guess Infinity fabric changes and maybe a change to their 8-wide decoder",Neutral
AMD,"I ""hope"" for significant power consumption progress with zen 6c, 3nm io chiplet and whatever design improvement they have made.",Positive
AMD,It will probably be the biggest upgrade since OG zen but I also expect it to be the biggest price hike for the same reason.  They are going from 5/4nm to 2nm so it's two node jumps (Skipping 3nm). They are rumored to be significantly upgrading the IO die and going from 8 to 12 cores and significantly increasing frequency and IPC.   Even auxiliary downsides we have been dealing with since the original move to chiplets (Really high idle power) are rumored to be fixed.   Don't expect it to be cheap though. I wouldn't be surprised if AMD kept producing large amounts of Zen 5 just because it will be expensive and the budget segment won't want to pay for 2nm and more cores.,Positive
AMD,"I just hope more PCIe lanes, but if they keep AM5 then I guess not much hope.",Neutral
AMD,"It sounds like it will have a lot of structural changes. They are probably moving to Fanout instead of SERDES for communication and they have big changes for memory as as of now 2-DIMM motherboards are incompatible with Zen 6 if they use the old layout (mass refresh started few months ago for mini ITX and other 2 DIMM boards) from DIMM A1/B1 into A2/B2. This then can offer better latency and other benefits, especially when they are increasing core count per CCD (and the more cores the higher throughput needed to feed all cores with the workload). Zen 7 will probably transition this to AM6.",Neutral
AMD,"Should be pretty damn big and make up for Zen 5% since it's actually skipping a node straight to N2 which is significant and resulting in some crazy clock speed rumours. Then yeah CCDs are supposed to be 12 cores now, so a 50% bump, I'd love a 10 core sku, or even 8 core Ryzen 5s if the price stays reasonable.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen6 is using a significantly better IO die, bridge dies, and the node is designed for *very* high clock speeds. You'll see clocks probably between 6-6.6ghz speeds. Along with 50% more cores lol.",Positive
AMD,"Well the shrink to N2 is quite significant. There're some crazy clock speed rumors I do not believe, so will not repeat, but somewhere in the mid 6GHz range would not be surprising. And some IPC gains (~10%?) on top. That plus the 1.5x core count and reworked IO die should make it quite interesting.",Neutral
AMD,"I recall AMD saying something along the lines of Zen 5 introducing new CPU features and Zen 6 being more about efficiently maximising the gains from them.  However, keep in mind that in terms of revenue, consumer CPUs are merely the icing on the cake.  The money is *all* about those Epycs.  So Zen 6's ""improvements"" will focused on what makes it better as a server core - if that also makes them better as consumer cores, then so much the better.  If not... not.  They very likely will be better as consumer CPUs, though.  The Zen 5 vs Zen 5 3D difference makes it clear how much the old IMC is holding it back.",Neutral
AMD,I'm going to guess Intel style stagnation,Neutral
AMD,"> I think it's possible that Zen 7 will use the same IO die, which would imply it will not be compatible with DDR6 or PCIe 6.0  It could be designed to support both. Intel Alder Lake (12th gen) supported both DDR4 and DDR5, after all.  > maybe Zen 7 will be on AM5 too?  That’s the current rumor.",Neutral
AMD,"It's entirely down to whether DDR6 is ready and in the market or not. AMD has other reasons it needs to improve the IO die, reusing the IO die on Zen 5 held back the generation. I'm going to surmise reusing the Zen 6 IO die on Zen 7 will similarly detract from potential performance gains. It isn't like redesigning the IO die is some hugely prohibitive cost factor anyway, AMD does it all the time with its mobile and server SKUs.",Neutral
AMD,"Beware humans look for patterns that aren't always there. AMD's IO design process is unlikely to follow any real pattern like this, 2 data points isn't a pattern. They have also released other CPU designs other than their desktop chips that all have an influence.",Neutral
AMD,"I think that would be reasonable. DDR6 is looking more like a 2028-ish technology, maybe even later in practice, so room enough to squeeze in Zen 7 without falling behind.",Neutral

AMD's latest roadmap indicates that Zen 6 is going directly to 2nm and is expected in 2026.  > What else is happening in 2026? AMD is retiring AGESA for OpenSIL. This means that the firmware that tells the motherboard how to communicate with the CPU is being replaced right about the time a new CPU is expected to launch.  > Is it possible that the socket will not be replaced and that every motherboard in-service will require not only a new BIOS but new BIOS type in order to function? Sure.  > But it's a lot more likely that AM5 will be a two-generation socket.  I do remember still seeing the doubts still be present even after Zen 5 and Arrow Lake launch.,Neutral
AMD,"I feel like if we're getting an IO die redesign for Zen 6, they're likely to reuse it for Zen 7 and keep compatibility one more gen.",Neutral
AMD,On what would you base such expectation? A singlilar exception in chipset world that was AM4?,Neutral
AMD,"Memory layout changes forced 2-DIMM boards refresh already. Then the more CPUs the bigger the BIOS becomes. 4-DIMM 600 should be ""safe"" but also AMD allegedly stopped all 600-series chipset production so there may be things behind the scene.",Neutral
AMD,On one hand I know what you mean and it sounds about right... on the other hand I dont think AMD had even one socket with exactly 3 generations of CPUs on it. And am4 is only 1 generation of socket so it is hard to predict trends based on only 1 sample.,Neutral

AMD,">  but I guess DDR6 is a pre-requisite for a new socket   It's not, if you look at Intel they kept changing their socket every 2 or 3 years with rarely any notable change (beyond power delivery systems) external to the CPU being related to the need for a new socket.",Neutral
AMD,> minor refreshes no real change  Where did you get that from this news?,Neutral
AMD,"The rumors are 12 core ccds, much faster interconnect, faster clocks and much lower idle power, hardly no real change.",Neutral

AMD,Obviously,Neutral
AMD,"> Especially if you want to run 4 sticks at high speeds  That's not a thing DDR6 will address. The opposite, if anything.",Negative

AMD,isn't DDR6 suppose to be CAMM2 exactly to deal with this problem?,Neutral
AMD,> Many high speed ddr5 kits are still quite unstable.  Cause they are all overclocking beyond any jedec spec...,Negative
AMD,What's considered high speeds? I've got 5600mhz sticks. Would it be unstable if I added 2 more?,Neutral
AMD,"This is why cudimm became a thing. When you have very high clock speeds and sending the clock signal from the cpu to several memory sticks it became a problem so they moved the clock to the memory module which makes it more stable and should be able to go even faster. With 5ghz the clock goes from [0 or 1] to [1 or 0] every 0.0000000002 second (200 pico seconds). So with less distance to travel the less it can get distorted or make timing errors between sticks, the timing window is very narrow at these speeds.",Neutral
AMD,The memory is stable. The only thing making it unstable is the garbage io die and motherboard layout.,Negative
AMD,"For what use case do you need 4 sticks of RAM even today, let alone a future with 2x or 4x DIMM sizes which would be supported by DDR5, let alone 6.  Consumer, prosumer, enthusiast, there's support for 2x64 GB which covers basically 100% of use cases.  For those 0.0001% use cases and enterprise, there are 256 GB RDIMMs, so dual-channel gets you up to 512 GB of RAM.",Neutral
AMD,I'm excited to see the evolution of the x3d lineup.,Positive
AMD,Finally AV1 encode,Neutral
AMD,should we see low idle power or still high due to chiplet design,Neutral
AMD,"Strix Halo also has almost 50% worse latency to main memory, and InFO packaging is more expensive and its manufacturing is low throughput so the final product is much higher cost.   Strix Halo using InFO is a one-off thing (likely used to fit a big GPU since SerDes takes up die space as node shrinks don't give better scaling on it) until cost and throughput improves in a way that makes it palatable for DIY.",Negative
AMD,That's maybe for server for client it may be N3 or N4 to save costs.,Neutral

AMD,"Looking at David Huang's SPECint2017 testing perf/GHz data and comparing an M4 Pro 3.04 / GHz against 9800X3D (2.40) and Strix Halo (2.08) shows Apple's M4 Pro currently at \~26.6% to 46% faster per clock than AMD's best.  Zen 6 only getting \~10% IPC gains would be pretty disappointing. If we assume the M5 Pro is around the same \~10%, then Zen 6 will still leave us with the current large perf/clock gap (which will roughly translate to perf/watt).",Neutral

AMD,"I read that DDR6 is going to be very expensive and probably move away from DIMMs entirely due to signal integrity constraints. So probably CAMM2 modules or something similar. Maybe consumer adoption will take a bit longer than previously for these reasons.

AMD,I imagine no drops in idle power. Lets see though?,Neutral
AMD,"The latency change ain't caused by the interconnect or packaging, it's caused by the use of lpddr with really loose timings. Point here, the product focuses on bandwidth for the igpu and not cpu gaming perf. It's a mobile workstation design that focuses on raw compute and not games  >That's a sea of wires. We use fan out, we're for level fan out in order to connect the two dies. So you get **the lower latency**, the lower power, it's stateless. So we're able to just connect the data fabric through that connect interface into the CCD. So the first big change between a Granite [Ridge] or a 9950X3D and this Strix Halo is the die-to-die interconnect.

AMD,A similar approach to how strix halo works. The rumor is they are using a fanout interconnect instead of their traditional infinity fabric interconnect. High yield talks about it in depth if you are interested in how it works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maH6KZ0YkXU   These are rumored improvements but it is more concrete then most rumors because they already used the technology on strix halo so it's not just possible but they have already done it on another consumer product.  It already massively helped with strix halo it's unknown if they improved it even further but even if they just use the same design we have already seen it make a massive difference.   You can look up the phawx videos on strix halo to see how efficient it is below 15w (Not Idle but like an entire 40cu IGPU and 16 cores running that low of a wattage.) The actual idle is orders of magnitude lower than their older chiplet designs you are probably aware but most single ccds zen desktops idle at like 30-40w so it's a big gap.,Neutral

In fact it is this conversion/encoding that consumes the most power and costs latency in serdes. Not the actual transmission of the signal.  With InFO you still have to figure out what goes where - and that will always cost some latency.  >Ever considered checking out steamdeck?

InFO connects electrical traces from one die to another using a passive electrical connection.  It introduces no more latency than a similar length connection on die.

I would expect the InFO interconnect to have around 3 clocks less latency than a SerDes connection, but at the clock rates involved it is still not very significant in the grand scheme.  \* a one-inch-long trace takes a small fraction of a nanosecond for electrons to traverse (less than 1/10th).

You learn these things in the final two years of high school. Clearly you're talking about things you don't understand.  Even the most basic operations use two loads and one store. With 32 bytes/cycle read/write BW, that is up to 96 bytes that can be requested from or written to memory to do a single operation.

This is just such a suggestive introduction. Because either the author wants to portray AMDs position on this issue as wrong (therefore claim AMD spreads misinformation) or really doesnt see any other way why AMD would make ARM Systems. Which could be to introduce ARM cores as it seems like a lot of the server market and maybe even windows pushes into the ARM Space, AMD just wants to get a piece of that cake too independent of the ISA.  >As an Arm design, it's likely to incorporate a big.LITTLE architecture  Interesting wording, lets see how Videocardz (which seems to be the primary source for this) comments it:  >Earlier leaks described the chip as featuring 2 P-cores and 4 E-cores. It reportedly integrates four RDNA 3.5 compute units \[...\]  Interesting, if this is a small AMD CPU, do we have any Comparison? Ohh yes, there is Kraken Point with 3+3C and 4 RDNA3.5 CUs, so if AMD just applies the same philosophies to their ARM IP (of which they likely have their own cores) which they have applied to Zen 5, we wont see a true big.LITTLE, but just a performance.COMPACT layout which is different from the usual ARM structure of actually changing the core. So I dont know if I am missing something here, but I dont see how this is any more likely to have a big.LITTLE architecture than any other recent client AMD CPU released.  >This computing power is designed to operate within a 10 W TDP power envelope, meeting the demand for extended gaming sessions on battery power alone.  Gaming on 4 RDNA3.5 CUs will be, ""ok"", wont be anything great, and the 10W TDP is also not that low. If we look again at the Ryzen AI 340 which has a similar layout this chip can already play on 10W, and chips like the 8840U as found in the GPD can already game on a 10W power cap. And with indie-games those chips might consume only \~5W, so it isnt really that impressive.  The question is if AMD can get their idle/office use power draw for these chips below \~2W and standby power draw to almost nil. 10W TDP isnt anything new for gaming on AMD chips. Especially because the Steam Decks Van Gogh (which I wouldnt use for comparison because it is a very old chip) games in the same \~10W since forever.  Also just imagine if we put Kraken Point on N3E or something, the cTDP of AMD currently goes as low as 15W on N4P (even though OEMs can introduce custom power limits). If we shrunk it to N3E, and put the CPU into a 2+4 config we could see how a roughly 10W lower cTDP is not really that far off.    So yeah, next-gen APU goes as low as 10W, shocking.

AMD,"I think both options are possible.  On the one hand: Why would AMD go through the effort of creating a ARM core or repurposing a Zen architecture (I'd suspect it be Zen 6) just for a niche product, also AMD probably has good experience building ARM APUs, from their cooperation with Samsung.  On the other hand: AMD has good experience with ARM and invested into custom designs in the pre-Zen time, they already have all the design capabilities and a strong CPU-Architecture they could share many structures with. And they can only win with (semi)custom CPUs anyways. I dont think they can gain the edge in Servers (which is most likely the long-term-goal), with default ARM cores which the Hyperscalers could just license themselves. AMD doesnt need to ""practice"" building chips, they have all the experience.  I think the PPA of something like Zen 6 on N3 isnt to bad compared to ARMs big cores. The X925 or C1-Ultra aren't particularly small. The only question is if AMD can solve idle power draw and performance-efficiency, but that is something they have to solve either way, especially to keep the x86 data center moat healthy. Additionally I dont think these cores are suited for server, so if AMD wants to share knowledge as heavy as they do it with Zen, this might not be a good investment.  So yes while it might is attractive and much simpler to go with ARM based core IP I think for the long term goal it might not be so beneficial, as they are going up against Nvidia+MediaTek who have access to the same IP, so if AMD offers nothing different it will be interesting where they believe they have the edge.  I could be totally wrong though, I have not a bit of good info on this.",Neutral
AMD,"But AMD has right now no high-performance ARM-compute offerings, only some of their IP has some like Xilinx Zynq and the likes.  So they have a history with ARM, but currently they have no real ARM offerings. So it is more of a ""reentry"" than a ""new entry"" for them.",Neutral
AMD,"I think a 4xRDNA3.5 on N3 could perform not to far off from the SteamDeck, depending on all the factors, including if AMD can manage to make RDNA3.5 on N3 sufficiently efficient to get going with such a small TDP.  The bigger problem will be that this is an ARM machine and a lot stuff will probably just not run as good from the start.  So I think 720p low gaming, as known from the SteamDeck, is not unrealistic if AMD can improve the efficiency of RDNA3.5 on this chip. So that is probably mediocre performance when we consider what we can get, but if the SteamDeck is ok, and this isnt far off, it is not terrible.",Neutral
AMD,"How would an ARM chip cheaper than something like kraken point? For kraken point they don't have to pay licensing, they have the core either way because server needs it, so they just put it onto an SoC and be done.

The X925 or C1-Ultra aren't particularly small  Looked up the size of a X925 and it's way bigger than the X4 was, I didn't realise these had grown so much. Regardless, I have my doubts a Zen 5-based core is going to be competitive in perf/w with C1-Ultra, and Zen 6 might even be bigger on N3 than Zen 5 is (i.e. designed with larger transistor budget of N2 in mind).  >they are going up against Nvidia+MediaTek who have access to the same IP, so if AMD offers nothing different it will be interesting where they believe they have the edge.

In Europe, on the well publicized court case, the commission thought that being dominant player automatically means you cant do exclusivity rebates (note even the prosecution didn't think the exclusivity rebates are per se illegal) but ECJ ruled that a exclusivity rebates used by a dominant player cannot automatically be considered as abusive conduct. It can be deemed abusive if it has the capability to foreclose competition. The court basically mandated analysis of actual market effects in cases like this.

AMD,"RISC-V didn't exist in the 90s and x86 marketshare hasn't ever been this low.  You are conflating RISC and RISC-V (which didn't exist until around 2010). As a historical aside, RISC was winning until Intel's EPIC/Itanium resulted in major RISC systems like HP-RISC and Alpha were shut down and the CEOs of the rest got scared and left the market. If EPIC had not happened, RISC would likely have taken over back then.  On the RISC front, all three big ARM cores beat x86 in performance, performance per watt, and performance per watt per area (the three key metrics).  Qualcomm is shipping tons of ARM-based laptops whatever you feel about them. Apple's ARM computers make up some 15% of the PC market in the US. MS recent Windows 10 security update situation has turned 200M+ laptops into E-waste overnight. At the same time, Apple's rumored A19 macbook is supposed to be hitting the market for even less than the M1 Macbook (which is often selling for $600 or less). We could see ARM/RISC marketshare jump yet again in a huge way.  On the server side, the money saved from using something like Graviton instead of x86 are way too much to ignore. There's a peak performance price to be paid (not that it matters most of the time), but Graviton 5 (Neoverse V3) should be extremely close to Zen5 performance levels which will drive RISC adoption even further.  RISC-V is a different story to other RISC because it is open.  Open means guaranteed compatibility, better free-market pricing of licensed cores and cheaper core development costs (eg, Qualcomm paying many billions per year to ARM who does nothing but own the ISA). This in turn means cheaper chips and devices for consumers.  We've already seen the first casualties in the embedded market. All the new chip designs are RISC-V (the smallest 32-bit RISC-V cores are smaller than something like 6502 IIRC). ARM has essentially ceded the market and refocused on phone/server because they know it's a lost cause. Even AMD has  RISC-V designs for their FPGA department.  This goes beyond the MCU market too. All Western Digital harddrives ship with multiple RISC-V cores inside. All Nvidia GPUs ship with RISC-V. Apple is supposedly replacing its 20+ 64-bit Chinook soft cores per chip with cheaper RISC-V alternatives. Samsung is shipping RISC-V cores everywhere they can too. In short, if you buy a brand-new PC, it probably has more RISC-V cores than x86 cores inside.  There are big RISC-V cores too. Big server/AI cores like Ventana Veyron 2 or Ascalon exist and are wider than x86 cores. SiFive 800-series cores seem to have higher IPC than something like Zen2-3 and they aren't even that big. It has become blatantly obvious that something about x86 makes it very hard to create wider, slower, more efficient core designs (6-wide Golden Cove spiked power levels into the stratosphere and 2x4 Zen5 decoders require massive complexity).  The elephant in the room is software compatibility, but Apple has proven that you can get good enough performance to support all that ancient x86 software flawlessly while newer software is generally being written in managed languages (Java, JS, C#, etc) or being designed with multiple ISAs in mind.  All the chip companies want to be in the server/PC market and now it is finally possible for them to compete. I see zero evidence that the x86 moat will continue. AMD already designed ARM versions of some of their cores and chose not to release (probably because they felt it would open the floodgates). Intel has far closer ties to RISC-V and a hybrid x86+RISC-V chip could make them a ton of money. The first one of them to cave and design such a chip (and get all the related x86 to RISC-V patents) will gain a guaranteed 20 year stream of legacy support.

Intel has none whatsoever ties to RISC(-V), that's nonsense … Intel actively avoids/fights anything RISC.  Intel back then *was* in fact involved into Berkley's newer RISC-prodigy and RISC-V wonder child *SiFive*, yes indeed. Though there's a story to it, and it's not how it looks!  Yes, Intel somehow managed to plant their mole at the top of it as their very CEO in 2017 (long-standing Intel-lifer infamous Naveed Sherwani), which was even before throwing some twenty-something millions at it through *Intel&nbsp;Capital* in SiFive's latest Series C-funding round in 2018, and even managed to get so far into post a (hostile) take-over bid in 2021.  Yet that hostile take-over luckily didn't even proceeded to the stage of actually happening, since Intel in their infamous arrogance blew the whistle way too early on, about what Santa Clara's intention were with SiFive afterwards, and it immediately blew up in Intel's face, all buy-out plans were cancelled by SiFive's obviously sane share-holders and their former corrupt (Intel-)CEO got rightfully ousted – Thank God for that! ❤️‍🩹  Since what Intel \*actually\* tried to do, was nothing short of outright **destroy** SiFive as long as it was still small (*""Kill it, before it can lay eggs!""*) as a direct competitor and the RISC-based threat to Santa Clara's x86.  Intel never had the intention to dip their toes into SiFive's RISC-V, never mind suddenly having a interest into anything remotely RISC-based per se. So all the whole story actually was about, was to extinguish a arising (RISC-) threat, before it becomes a actual problem and too costy to deal with (talking about bribes).  Intel hates everything non-x86 and others with a almost manic passion and especially has a problem with RISC and ARM in general, so there was never a chance for Intel being even remotely interested into suddenly trying to 'follow the market' with RISC(-V) for some monetary success. *That's NOT how Intel works*.  In Intel's view, Intel alone dictates the market – Everyone has to follow, or just die. Everyone opposing such ruling, has to be eventually extinguished, no questions asked, because Santa Clara ruled so. That's especially relevant to anyone opposing or even remotely threatening x86 as the mainstream-platform.  So their whole SiFive-entanglement had no other intended outcome, but to kill SiFive right away anyway, and with that basically plain extinguish everything **RISC-V as a whole** quickly, in a single run, for just peanuts.  Also, many industry-analysts and the informed people already called it a (tried) hostile take-over from the moment it got announced, just to take SiFive behind the barn *as is* immediately afterwards.   Doing that by then, was something Intel painfully missed to do with ARM, when Intel had ""the chance to do so"" and when British *Acorn Computers* (then Acorn RISC Machines/Advanced RISC Machines Ltd., Arm Ltd.) was still young and small back then … until it became the costy problem Intel fought for years in the mobile space, wasting $12–15Bn for helplessly trying to fight ARM-powerhouses like Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek and others aka the myriad of ARM-licencees in tow since.  ---- Though it's highly likely, that any whatsoever take-over or subsidiary-talks wouldn't've even proceeded in light of any anti-trust vetoes anyway.

Though rest assured, that AMD did **not** kill nor bury anything of their ARM-derived K12!   *Sure enough, a while ago some engineering-sample surfaced in some mysterious GeekBench-listing* …  You can be certain, that AMD internalized one crucial thing under Su with K12/Zen and since anything Bulldozer;  > *»No enterprise is more likely to succeed, than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.«*   — Niccolo Machiavelli  So AMD is most definitely sneakily working in utter secrecy on some K12-derived ARM-design, for prepping up a Zen-like majorly potent ARM-architecture, to eventually (over-)take the market by storm (again, this time using ARM), when the time is just right …  That is to be understood as: *When Intel is weak and has become irrelevant enough, to NOT actually be able to interfere*, thus as soon as Intel can't do anything about it nor can't pay their beloved OEMs anymore, to corrupt the Userland and taint the market again (as Santa Clara always did from the get-go), to again prevent actual *natural* competition and the survival of the actually best platform the market actually decides upon.  Also keep in mind, that it was of all things AMD, who laid the foundation for ARM-designs in the server-space and brought the successful fore-runner of Amazon's Graviton, releasing their ARM&nbsp;Cortex&nbsp;A57-based SoCs as the ARM *Opteron A11xx*-series (*Seattle*) when Amazon didn't actually wanted it (only for Amazon to lengthy develop their own ARM-based Graviton-cores afterwards, when buying up their now subsidiary Annapurna Labs instead).  So AMD has plenty of expertise with ARM and did already a whole lot of basic ground-work – Intel has nothing of it, never invented anything ARM and on top of that, tossed every bit of ARM-expertise when ousting DEC's former ARM-personnel of StrongARM™ while ditching everything StrongARM/XScale to Marvell&nbsp;Technology in 2006 …  AMD is well-prepared for ARM, Intel is NOT and actively avoided anything ARM out of principle – *Their holy cow x86*.",Neutral

Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is scoring significantly higher in Geekbench 6 and Cinebench 2024 vs the best laptop CPU’s from AMD and Intel (both single-thread and multi-core) in [early testing](https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/prozessoren/snapdragon-x2-elite-extreme-benchmarks.94438/).

AMD,>Basically ARM is efficiency but doesn't scale well YET while x86 does.   That's simply not true in the modern days   AMD and Intel made desktop CPUs and adapt them to laptops and servers. ARM vendors do laptop/phone CPUs and adapt them to everywhere else and that is a winning strategy in every metric that matters.    The reason AMD and Intel chase 6Ghz clockspeeds is that way they can save up money elsewhere on the die and be more profitable. This means that Intel and AMD have CPUs that have the same frontend width as a 5 year old ARM CPU and are behind by a ton in IPC.    Meanwhile Apple and QC are now doing close to 5Ghz CPUs (QC X2 Elite Extreme reaches those clocks) too by adapting their designs and still having a very healthy PPW lead,Neutral

ComfyUI also has aspects of this, mainly with custom nodes that only work in very specific setups and node installations that can destroy your existing installation. There are users (some will know who I talk about) that spam github with ads for paid products that do this.  WanGP is IMHO the most stable one for trying out new models, because the guy behind it puts a lot of energy into it, and you can update it casually, but it has few features and the recent installation download is broken out of the box, so you again have to tinker.

AMD,The reason console companies went with AMD was because AMD was on its way to bankruptcy so console makers got a fire sale on the PS4 and Xbox One chips. After that it became more difficult for those 2 companies to leave AMD due to backwards compatibility. Apparently Intel was driving a good bargain for Sony for the PS6 but don't declined because of backwards compatibility issues.   Nintendo stuck with IBM for the Wii u and once they were out chip shopping for the Switch they weren't locked down to AMD because back compat was not a concern for Wii U -> Switch. Nintendo went with Nvidia because Nvidia too gave them a sweetheart deal. Now Nintendo continued with Nvidia for the switch 2 and I bet backwards compatibility was a huge factor there.,Neutral
AMD,Sony uses AMD hw for backwards compatibility so you can expect it.,Neutral
AMD,"Since RDNA2 it has had BVH/tri testing in hardware, but traversal and scheduling get punted back to the CU to handle, the acceleration structure is also crammed into the TMU cache so there's contention.   It's a really diespace efficient design, and provides good enough performance for rudimentary RT operations, but going forward fully discreet RT blocks are necessary.",Neutral
AMD,"Actually makes RDNA4 very impressive that it manages to perform as well as it does in RT while being handicapped architecture-wise.  Yeah, it does fall significantly behind in PT, but I guess that’s what moving to dedicated RT cores is specifically meant to resolve.",Positive
AMD,"I wouldn't call rdna2's implementation rudimentary. It is part of the pipeline in that it accelerates intersection testing, but ultimately the difference with Nvidia has always been traversal acceleration.   It will still probably do intersection testing using some clever he block like they did with rdna2, but the great news is the hw block for traversal.",Neutral
AMD,"This all basically follows what I've been saying for a good while now. AMD leverages their partnership with Sony to develop solutions that make sense in that context and simply scales it up for PC gaming.    This makes sense because both pay for the R&D. It massively reduces the risk AMD takes when building PC GPUs when their sales are an order of magnitude lower than Nvidia.    If they figure out their economics and actually undercut nvidia, they might have a chance. Merely catching up won't do them wonders but at least there won't be any real reason to discard them either.",Neutral
AMD,"Why be salty? Be happy AMD is improving, it benefits everyone.",Positive
AMD,"That’s what I really am curious about, how they gonna beat that.",Neutral
AMD,"Not really. They really only did it once (40 series), while the others were minor tweaks.  * 20 Series had a solid Lvl 3 implementation from the start. * 30 series allowed concurrent RT+Compute + implemented HW RT motion blur (for 3DFX and proviz not gaming) + 33% larger L1 * 40 series, OMM, SER and DMM (deprecated) and supersized L2  * 50 series, LSS + RTX MG HW decompression  2X ray/tri matters very little compared to the rest.  RDNA 4 while behind on some fronts are actually ahead of Blackwell on multiple fronts. They have OBB+Dynamic VGPR (now Intel has that too with Xe3) and instance node transformations in HW (NVIDIA hasn't specified this yet).   DXR 1.2 forces them to support OMM and SER in HW. AMD will also have BVH traversal in HW as well (Radiance Cores). All they need now is LSS, but they investigated that years before 50 series launched in a filed patent and it's the next logical step so they'll prob have it. RTX MG functionality is neccesary as well so they'll prob have something similar + DGF in HW.  Then there's ton of additional stuff well beyond 50 series in patents but impossible to say what will actually get implemented but it can push the implementation WELL beyond 50 series.     So the question is not if RDNA 5 will leapfrog Blackwell but instead by how much and where Rubin will land relative to it.",Neutral
AMD,"(it was just a joke, I guess it wasn't obvious enough for some people here)",Neutral
AMD,"Prob no earlier than GDC 2027 would be my guess :( But the Cerny road to PS5 is going to be something.  Other overlooked info was Cerny talked about flexible and efficient data structures for ray tracing, implying fundamental changes to how BVH's are constructed and managed. This could be things like compression for overlay trees, delta instances, DMMs and DGF and probably many things that're still not public.  Also Hunyh specifically talking about reduced CPU overhead from Radiance Engines. That can only mean one ting: Fully GPU driven BVH construction. H-PLOC was the first step, but they've gone much further it seems:   [https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US464434269](https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US464434269)  And sure enough \^here's the final nail in the coffin with BVH reduction and sorting in HW and notice who's behind the patent. Not some randos at AMD but Chajdas, Brennan and Oberberger.   Notice how it's about more than that and how all data can remain within RT cores by default thanks to the clever BVH treelet design:   *""Compared to a software-only solution, the solutions presented herein delegate more expensive processing steps to hardware. It also minimizes memory access latencies, thereby increasing overall ray tracing system efficiencies.""*  *""It also minimizes memory traffic, since all requisite data can be stored in an internal memory of the sorting circuitry, instead of multiple DMA requests between register files and sorting circuitry.""*  This should result in large speedups. I assume this Fully GPU driven BVH pipeline would benefit from Work Graphs as well.  As always nothing is confirmed, this is just speculation informed by patent analysis and some reasonable guesses.",Neutral
AMD,"You are right. Instead of hardware, I should have wrote ""dedicated hardware"".",Neutral
AMD,"You can thank Instance transformations in HW, Dynamic VGPR and OBBs for that. IIRC NVIDIA has neither rn. Merely equalizing vs Blackwell on other HW spec for NG AMD GPU still gives a big advantage from the above three.  Yeah that + DXR 1.3 compliance (beyond DXR 1.2). PT is also incredibly demanding and OMM and SER practically mandatory, which is why it absolutely destroys anything pre 40 series.",Neutral
AMD,"Might be a bit of a exaggeration.  It has also been much weaker overall. AMD really didn't invest remotely enough silicon until RDNA 4, but now they still have a massive gap due to lack of BVH traversal in HW, OMM and SER even with RDNA 4's unique features.  That trick is most likely pre-filtering that's mentioned in multiple recent patents. Using INT instead of FP multiple times higher intersect/area vs RDNA 4 and only using FP for final inconclusive tests. But everything has to be contained within one block for maximum latency and memory crosstalk reduction. Whether that's a seperate block or still coupled to TMU, who knows.",Negative
AMD,"They also share a lot of R&D with DC thanks to UDNA. Only gaming specific stuff is shared with Sony. Overall a smart strategy it seems.   Yeah not hoping for that, so the best AMD can do is lean really hard on features like NVIDIA to differentiate RDNA 5. That's a bit pessimistic, but then again we don't know anything about 60 series.",Neutral

No, but every new console gen is clean slate.  Hoping for more details at FAD in November, but probably too much to ask.",Neutral
AMD,Well unlike prev gens RDNA 5 is not RDNA 4 tweaked it's a clean slate architecture and ISA. Also no one will even know what AMD will call it till after AMD FAD in November.    KeplerL2 said it'll be the largest change since TeraScale -> GCN and many patents suggesting this as well and these have leading R&D people behind them so it's a serious tech push.  But yeah RDNA 5 dGPU will really just be console scaled up.,Neutral
AMD,It's co-engineered. I dout they'll be major differences in the GPU IP.   Yeah fs and hope they find the right balance.,Neutral
AMD,"Consoles are almost always targeting a 4k output (as opposed to many PC players who are playing on a 1440p monitor). The only GPUs that can currently handle path tracing in Cyberpunk at 60 fps with performance upscaling (1080p to 4k) and no frame generation are the 4090 and 5090 (see the 5080 getting under 50 fps in that scenario in the first part of [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIk7gad4GB8)). That's a $1000 GPU.  I think that in order for a PS6 game to support path tracing, at least one of the following will be true:  - The path tracing is sub 60 fps.  - It renders at sub 1080p. I think the PS6 will support high-quality upscaling, but I think sub 1080p to 4k is still too aggressive of upscaling. I think at that point, you're probably better off using cheaper rendering techniques at a higher resolution.  - The path tracing is very compromised. For instance, Alan Wake 2's path-tracing mode [sometimes doesn't use path tracing for certain things](https://youtu.be/tXfwvohROPA?t=886), and the bounce count can be configured to be as low as 1 (it falls back to baked lighting, which it can get away with because there is no day/night cycle).  - It's a low-poly game (e.g., Minecraft RTX or Quake II RTX). I personally would love if developers started to release games like this.  - The PS6 is ridiculously expensive for a console.  - The PS6 makes even larger performance gains than I expect (and I expect it to make very substantial performance improvements with ray tracing).  -------------------------------------  In past, I've guessed that the PS6 gen will be a gen that (after a cross-gen period), most games will substantially use ray tracing at 60 fps (e.g., an RTGI system and reflections). Then, path tracing will become the norm at 60 fps on the PS7.",Neutral
AMD,"*""...it'll have to rely on NRC and other optimizations to lower samples per pixel as ReSTIR is just not feasible rn. Too demanding.""*  Read it again.  Yes indeed, but that's ReSTIR PT which is pretty much 2020 tech.       Stuff will get better. Neural encoding will replace shader code and data encoding for many aspects, we already see that with NRC, Neural appearance models, importance sampling, AMD's GATE and their Neural Visibility cache. This is only the beginning. Stuff will run faster and look much better.  Intel also used Histogram Stratification to massively boost image fidelity compared to ReSTIR. So far NVIDIA has only used NRC to massively boost accuracy, they haven't used it with a leaner input. That's the entire point of all these technologies to lean the input and boost  the output. NVIDIA has chosen eye candy but assuming people are fine with ReSTIR PT fidelity it'll get a lot faster in the future.  PS6 HW is entirely unknown, but from what I can gather from available patents rn, there's massive foundational changes to completely overhaul the RT pipeline. This is a much bigger deal than 40 or 50 series, it's on a whole new level. So it could actually end up near a 5090 in PT processing efficiency. and not this is not me mindlessly copying what MLID said, this is based on analysis of the patents, but it does assume that AMD pushes it hard and doesn't use the increased HW efficiency to cut back on silicon investment.  1. Depends on how heavy it is. ReSTIR PT sure, something else I don't think so.  2. Can't see why that's an issue if the upscaler is another DLSS 3.7 -> DLSS 4 leap in fidelity. AMD talked about larger tiles in video and I've done some digging and this is a huge deal for the CNN stage of FSR5. When Huynh said more capable that's prob an understatement. And there's a lot of other stuff in the pipeline they can leverage. HW will be much more capable than RDNA 4, they could use enhanced data formats to make INT4 and FP4 viable for upscalers and neural rendering (MLPs).  3. Yes which is why neural rendering has to be leveraged. Raw PT is impossible but neurally augmented PT sure.  4. 100% stylized voxel or low quality asset games are basically made for PT. I hope to see some excellent games using this during PS6 era.  5. Yeah that could happen and I don't think that's neccesary. All that matters is HW sophistication for RT like I discussed prev.    \- Meanwhile AI will gobble up NAND, wafers and DRAM and push prices to the stratosphere. DRAM and NAND Inventories and waiting period are rapidly deteriorating. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets as bad for both as during crypto bubble. So 4x price jump on NAND and DRAM. This will pretty much destroy PS6 gen unless Sony can find a clever workaround (Native default injection of neural asset compression for games stored).  6. This will happen, like I said the RT in patents is bonkers. Too soon to write a post about it but safe to say this is no joke.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm sure that path tracing and denoising algorithms will improve, allowing developers to get away with using fewer rays. However, there are limits to how much it can improve, and improvements may introduce tradeoffs (e.g., aggressive reuse of data from previous frames introducing ghosting).  >So it could actually end up near a 5090 in PT processing efficiency.  If by PT processing efficiency, you mean performance adjusted for transistor count and clock speeds, then I would agree that the PS6 may well offer PT processing efficiency near a 5090. Maybe the PS6 would even offer _better_ PT processing efficiency than a 5090. If by ""PT processing efficiency"" you mean performance, then...  Console GPUs are usually lower-mid tier GPUs. For instance, the GPU in the PS5 is roughly equivalent to the RX 6700 (same architecture, same number of CU, but the RX 6700 is clocked ~10% higher). That had an MSRP of $479 at launch, between the launch MSRP of the 9060XT and 9070. The PS5 will almost certainly use AMD's upcoming RDNA5/UDNA architecture. If that history tells us where on the RDNA5/UDNA stack the PS6's GPU will be, and it keeps the same naming scheme as RDNA4, the the PS6 will likely have a GPU between the 10060 XT and 10070.  I have no doubt that the overhaul the RT pipeline will offer great RT improvements, but for a 10060 XT/10070 to have PT performance around that of the 5090, AMD will need to make architectural improvements for RT that not only match Nvidia, but greatly leapfrog the RT/PT architectural efficiency of Nvidia's 50 series.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm not just takling about denoising but also importance sampling, radiance caches, visibility caches and improved inputs for neural rendering (MLPs). The totality of changes easily add to up crazy ray tracing efficiency gains.   Yeah ghosting might be an issue, and this is why everything is moving towards neural rendering. Analytical is just not good enough.  It'll all be neurally enhanced. Some of it might be replaced entirely such as direct illumination: [https://arxiv.org/html/2506.05930v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.05930v2), Look at how close the result is to offline PT ground truth.  No I actually mean a 9070-9070XT tier GPU being capable of a PT processing speed (subpart of entire frame, not the entire frame) at the level of a RTX 5090.  I know this sounds completely mental, but here's some potential patent changes I can highlight   1. Quantized ray tracing, using tiny parallel (multiple times smaller than current) and very wide (BVH8-16) integer intersection testers to mass cull triangles, primitives and bounding boxes. Multiple to several times more intersections per area, that's independent of N4 -> N3P BTW.   2. Ray coherency sorting by object, triangle cluster and TLAS nodes. By doing this all rays tested against one point in the BVH are processed together massively reducing load on the memory system. This is the holy grail of ray tracing. Ray coherency sorting is much more impactful than NVIDIA's thread coherency sorting (AMD will have this too).   3. Delayed Any Hit evaluation with subsequent global sort across Shader engine to ensure unpredecented SIMD occupancy. This will smoke NVIDIA's shader execution reordering.   4. Global sorting unit that can arrange payloads to maximize data locality once again reducing divergence and cache memory load. Applicable for all parts of the RT pipeline in theory.   5. Shared ray/edge inside/outside testing eliminating duplicative tests.   6. Dedicated BVH ray traversal pipeline like Intel and NVIDIA.  Addional changes.   7. Native DGF decompression and a fallback method called prefiltering nodes that can prob work by default in all mesh shaded games.   8. Linear swept spheres, OMM support and SER support.   9. Fast Displaced micro maps that can evaluate 64 triangles as only 14 triangles reducing traversal steps to just one.   10. Streaming wave coalescer matching 50 series SER that doesn't require developer work unlike SER.  This is not even exhaustive. There's more stuff.  50 series has a mediocre RT implementation in comparison.  Think the consensus amongst the best leakers is 9070-9070XT raster.  Agreed which is exactly what I described above. The equivalent multiple to several gens of leapfrogging based on NVIDIA usual cadence.",Neutral

AMD,"Ok, here's how to think about the recent Nvidia and AMD deals with openAI:  Nvidia deal: basically Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for a portion of the GPU purchases with stock.  It works like this: for every $10B of Nvidia GPU that openAi buys, Nvidia invests something like $6B (iirc) back in openAI, buying their stock.  This means effectively $4B of the purchase is in cash and $6B is in stock.  AMD deal: openAI buys full price but gets AMD stock as rebate.  The deal is almost like an employee compensation plan.  Every GPU purchased earns openai a stock award.  The Nvidia deal works for openai because it's valuation rich but cash poor and works for Nvidia because it has a large margin on its chips and get to invest in a way that juices its own sales.  The AMD deal works for AMD because their stock price is relatively low and they need to jump start purchases of their ai hardware.  It works for openai because they get a rebate effectively and a Nvidia alternative to diversify supply risk.  Both deals are actually pretty safe because they are pay as you go with relatively small actual upfront commitments and no leverage involved.  Basically companies giving each other coupons.",Neutral
AMD,"So technically if everything from the Nvidia deal with OpenAI goes through and the equity stake of AMD for OpenAI goes through (not confusing at all btw) - Nvidia effectively owns a portion of AMD via it's stake in OpenAI.

While it remains to be seen how it will play out, giving 10% of the company to OpenAI to secure a marquee customer is something of an uncharacteristically bold move from Lisa, who is normally more conservative.   This does break the moratorium on AMD Instinct though. If OpenAI is buying so many, other frontier AI labs don't have much of a reason not to diversify GPUs.",Positive
AMD,"Why would AMD even feel the need to do this? My understanding was that AMD had zero problems selling all the chips it could print, and the sheer scale of OpenAI's expansion plans guaranteed they would into the future even despite NVIDIA's $100 billion backing.   160 million shares at $200 a pop is a cool $32 billion dollars in instant capital that OpenAI can leverage on its books to borrow against, and when the cracks in the financial walls finally get too big they can switch to selling the stock outright for cash to survive another year or two.

AMD,"Nvidia didn't actually throw $100B at OpenAI.  It's basically a invest as you go deal with a ceiling of $100B.  Basically, for every $1 of GPU purchase by OpenAI, Nvidia buys $0.6 of stock from OpenAI, so in essence Nvidia allows Open AI to pay for 60% of its purchase in stock and the rest in cash.  Recall that Nvidia's gross margin on their GPUs are about 70% and even their net profit margin is about 55%  So even on a cash basis Nvidia is still revenue positive on the GPUs it will sell to open ai, while it gets rewarded handsomely in openAI stock.  If the deals DO reach the announced $100B value, it will have meant that openAi would have found enough revenue to meet its most optimistic projections, in which case NVIDIA's stock purchase would be worth a fortune.  From both company's perspective this is a win win.  Where's the downside?  The downside is the extra planned production capacity, which is being shouldered by Nvidia and TSMC.  TSMC is actually carrying significant counterparty risk in these deals because both the Nvidia and the AMD deals translate to larger planned buys that may not materialize.  It's TSMC that has to build the physical factories to make all the chips, and they have to do so ahead of projected demand.  That mean they have to treat these large projected buy numbers as ""real"" or risk failing their customers.  On the other hand they know that the upper range of these numbers have got to be BS, but where to place their bets?  TSMC is probably actually happy for Intel foundry and Samsung to soak up some of the projected demand so they are not alone in carrying the risk of over building manufacturing capacity.",Neutral

A lot of times you spend as much time verifying that it's true as time saved from getting the quick response in the first place. Some use cases are pretty good- I can ask AI a general question about some topic and get a few bullet points that I can follow up on with actual research.   Or, I can ask it to write me a SQL query or Regex pattern, or an entire function in C# if it has the right context to work with, and that's great- but I still need to check all of it after.

Their fundamentals are fine for the most part, they have a valuable proprietary technology moat, aren't particularly overleveredged, are low in debt, etc. its terrible for many nvidia investors who may be depending on nvidia's stock price unrealistic current evaluation bc the stock will collapse, but a stock price catering is on its own not enough to kill a company. A stock price crash can kill a company if the company needs the investor money to invest in something to scale up production to profitable levels (nvidia is already mostly at scale so this isn't a problem), if the company is already going through a massive debt crisis/restructuring, or whatever other scenario that their revenue can't cover short term cash flow. Of course this can still wipe out irresponsible investors, but that's a different story. Hell even in the extreme unrealistic case where ai 100% dies, I think nvidia has a good chance of surviving, and even outside that, their IP and market presence is large enough that in the worst case they will be bought out, and even if that somehow fails, they're likely to be bailed out to retain any sensitive IP. If Chrysler can survive 2008, nvidia can survive the ai bubble popping  And investing in a company to buy your product isn't as dumb as it sounds at first (though I think the scale involved is a bit ridiculous.) Nvidia isnt just investing in openai to buy their products directly, they're investing in openai to scale up open ai into being a mature, reliable, and dependent Nvidia customer. This is actually pretty common among ang large industry. This is exactly how aws managed to become big so fast, they invested in random companies that weren't profitable so that they could scale up and become profitable companies that were dependent on aws, EVs do this with battery companies and vice versa, this is how most early industrial companies like JP Morgan grew, this is how telecom grew, dot com, etc. Now it pretty much guarantees a bubble, or rather it only makes sense in a bubble, since the goal is to have the people you invested in mature fast enough to survive the bubble popping and then remain dependent on you.

Also reportedly OpenAI can't find enough supply to buy already, so a written formal agreement of future purchases changes nothing and either way it makes no sense. Unless all those reports were exaggerating demand and supply.  That's not the worst case, this dilutes AMD shares, gives OpenAI stake in the company, and those 160 million shares are guaranteed to either be sold or cashed out at a future date when OpenAI suddenly needs funds. Dumping that many shares will guarantee a hit to the future stock price, or if they are transferred in full to a third party via sale/acquisition of OpenAI then that's yet another potential risk for AMD. Before this deal the largest shareholder was only around 3-4%, so if someone wanted to make a future play on a hostile takeover buying that 10% stake from OpenAI after the company implodes would be the first order of business. Honestly I don't think it's particularly likely, but why set the table so the risk is there especially when there's no gain for doing so, if the AI bubble pops OpenAI is going with it and those shares will end up somewhere else.

This was factually correct on both counts: 1) compare amd pe to Nvidia 2) see AMD stock performance day of the announcement  Being relatively low or high versus comparable companies in the current market or versus anticipated pricing in some future scenario is well defined and relatively simple in concept, free of hidden assumptions.  Being ""fair"" is not in the sense that you were putting forth where a company's stock could be deemed fairly valued based on fundamentals compared to some absolute standard or some historical average or market average.  Now you have dragged in a huge number of hidden assumptions and subjective taste, and wedded yourself by taste to a philosophy of valuation that fits poorly with the market's actual dynamical behavior.  All of this leads to confusing analysis that tends to bury rather than surface actionable insights.  Investing based on ""fundamentals"" is actually hugely complicated.  You use a simple seeming set of analyses but all of the above complexity is shoved into candidate sector selection, company selection and trade execution behaviors based on inference centered human neural network training (ie taste and intuition) combined with complex logic.    Only very few people can do that in a way that beats the market consistently after a lifetime of experience.

AMD,"The proof comes after the crash. This is nothing like the.com bubble at this point, but it is similar to the subprime mortgage. The key difference between this and the subprime mortgage crisis though, is that people are not at risk of losing their homes to the same degree that they were at risk with the subprime mortgages. When this bubble burst, it is unlikely to threaten the stability of the entire global economy and people will not be losing their homes as a direct result. Indirect? Probably, but not directly linked to one another.  Edit: So we are clear, ""the proof comes after the crash"" isn't meant to mean there's no warning signs or signals, but this isn't the first ""obvious bubble"" in the economy since the subprime mortgage or dot com bubble, and most do not result in a crash.  We never truly know when something is a bubble until the crash, failures are always far easier to diagnose and address after the fact.

AMD,"The name was intentionally misleading.  AMD has one actual chipset for AM5, Promontory 21. All the labels are marketing names for various configurations of that chip on a board.  Each P21 has 12x PCIe lanes, some USB3 hosts, and SATA ports hanging off it (among other more minor things). Every difference between the marketing names other than that comes down to certification for the most part, like if they officially say the chipset lanes support PCIe 5, or if they require the motherboard maker to support USB4.  B650, B650E, B850, B850E, and critically, X870, use one of these chips.   X670, X670E, and X870E use two of these chips.  In effect, this means that X670 *vanilla* gives you 8x more downstream chipset PCIe lanes (4 are used to connect the two PROM21 chips), more USB ports and more SATA ports, than its more expensive successor in X870.  AMD basically named X870 to make it look like a replacement for X670, when it isn't. It's missing considerable IO functionality that X670 has by having that second IO chip.",Neutral

AMD,TBH even with severe performance cost of FSR 4 INT 8 on lower - mid range GPUs It is now the undisputably the best option for upscaling for non RTX GPUs now despite it being worse on image quality compared to the official FP8 version and DLSS 4.  Now I am really curious to see a test of something like RX 6600 with FSR 4 Int 8 vs RTX 3050 with DLSS 4 just to see which hardware based upscaler is more efficient and can produce better performance on older hardware.,Positive
AMD,Reddit finally admitting that FSR3 and under were in fact terrible after all now. 😀,Negative
AMD,"With good reason, as it turns out. I tested it yesterday in AC Shadows on my 7800XT and  the performance is just not good.",Negative
AMD,"If only AMD had embraced a better model back when.  At the very least RDNA3 would have launched with the necessary grunt. Instead AMD listened to all the fans saying ""this is fine"" to crap like FSR 1-3, which everyone admits is trash now.",Negative
AMD,Most games run at 4k balanced medium at 60 FPS before frame gen on my 6800XT. I maybe able to push FSR4 at 4k on performance with a mix of low/medium with an OCed 6800XT (+12% over ref perf).,Neutral

AMD,Does this work on my Vega 56?,Neutral
AMD,"At 15:38 Tim says that XeSS Quality has higher internal resolution than FSR4 Balanced. Didn't Intel change their whole naming scheme with these modes?   I thought at one point they renamed their ""Balanced"" mode to ""Quality"" and all other levels as well were knocked down a notch in resolution. They should have the same resolution I believe. Or was that only for the full XMX version on their own GPUs???  All that makes me question if it's worth using over DP4a XeSS. The performance gains on DP4a are often larger, and if FSR4 Balanced looks similar to Quality DP4a XeSS, maybe by sometimes DP4a is the better option.   But I've also seen some very slow running XeSS implementations. It was a joke in Cyberpunk at launch costing like 2-3x the milliseconds to compute compared to FSR2.",Neutral

AMD,"Yep, they tried to hide poor performing (framerate wise) implementation of their tech from you.  Edit: Okay, okay, I was being facetious.",Negative

AMD,It's also a good alternative as some sort of better anti-aliasing option for less demanding games as well. compared to native TAA that always looks like crap.,Positive
AMD,"The examples I saw from 3 to 4, both look really good still.  HOWEVER, this one example [here in the video](https://youtu.be/yB0qmTCzrmI?t=1090) is my biggest complaint with 3 by far which seems to be solved with 4.  Yes, the absolutely tiny details aren't as good with 3, and they look better with 4, but that for me was basically a non-issue.  The real issue was particles and ghosting.  For most games, again, it wasn't an issue, but rain, snow, games in space, or thin objects like ropes moving quickly had horrible ghosting and I'm very happy to see that doesn't look like an issue anymore.",Positive
AMD,it's been insanely good. from reviews the picture/video quality is an improvement. and brings new life into the older gen GPUs.   almost as huge as introducing x3D cache into cpu. AMD has essentially extended life of both their products.   it's not on par with 9000s fsr4 but it's close enough from what I've seen from reviewers.   crazy cuz folks weren't sure if 6000s card could even handle it.,Positive

AMD,Yeah just add some optiscaler sharpening or contrast adaptive sharpening and it looks just as good as native,Positive
AMD,"You can run it on the Steam Deck, there's plenty of YouTube tutorials for setting it up.",Neutral
AMD,"Not entirely true, but it's also not your fault for thinking that. Percentage based performance charts for upscalers is unfortunately a very bad way of understanding what kind of performance uplift to expect. But because a YT audience won't really understand game performance in terms of frametimes and only in terms of framerates, I can understand why HUB chose to explain performance the way they did, even if I don't like it personally.  I could explain it here, but I suck at writing out stuff like this in a way that makes sense. So instead I'll push you over to [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nvibgd/explaining_some_misconceptions_about_the_cost_of/). Read this thread for a full understanding, but for a short breakdown, this bit is the most important part:  > Imagine I have Game A, B and C which can render natively at 720p at 30, 60 and 120FPS respectively and upscaling to 1440p with FSR3 and FSR4. For FSR3 on the 6600 the 1440p upscale cost is usually ~1.2ms, while for FSR4 it's ~4.3ms. This is how switching from FSR3 to FSR4 would impact the performance profile in each game:  > Game A (30FPS = ~33ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~33ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 34.2ms = 29.2FPS  >     FSR4: ~33ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 37.3ms = 26.8FPS  > Game B (60FPS = ~16ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~16ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 17.2ms = 58.1FPS  >     FSR4: ~16ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 20.3ms = 49.3FPS  > Game C (120FPS = ~8ms to render a frame):  >     FSR3: ~8ms + 1.2ms for FSR3 upscale = 9.2ms = 108FPS  >     FSR4: ~8ms + 4.3ms for FSR4 upscale = 12.3ms = 81.3FPS  > On game A FSR4 gets 91.7% the performance of FSR3, on game B it gets 84% the performance of FSR3 and on game C it gets 75% the performance of FSR3.  This should explain that as your input framerate gets lower, the output framerate will be closer between FSR3 and FSR4. So actually FSR4 is actually more useful when you're trying to hit 60-70fps than it would be if you're already well beyond that.",Negative
AMD,"For the most part I agree, but at very low frame rates, where a game forces you to use ray tracing, it could be worth it. Doom The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones, and pretty much all ue5 games tank performance hard at high resolutions on RDNA2 and RDNA3. You're pretty much forced to use upscaling because of how unplayable some of those games are already, and will be in the future without it.",Neutral
AMD,"The point of upscaling is to improve performance, but FSR is more than just upscaler. Its also a temporary AA. One that is much better than most native TAA implementations.",Positive
AMD,bet 6600 still wins despite the fsr4 cost,Neutral
AMD,As a long term AMD user ive always complained about FSR and used XESS whenever its available.,Neutral
AMD,"There were games where FSR 3.x and even 2.x weren't bad. In Deathloop, FSR 2.x was very close to DLSS. In cyberpunk, FSR was always atrocious. Same for black myth wukong - both Nvidia sponsored. FSR was done very well in Warhammer 40k: space marine 2. Many examples where it was implemented well and was decent. Just as many examples where it sucked. Now AMD users have a better option, but it doesn't automatically make all prior FSR3 unusable. I recently compared FSR4 native AA to FSR3 native AA in death stranding and it was very close.",Negative
AMD,I have seen nothing but bashing of FSR 2/3 for years. Who are you shadowboxing?,Negative
AMD,"Very astute observation, also where have all the ""Fake frames"" people gone to?",Neutral
AMD,FSR3 is good to have because it works on *everything*. It has pretty much been carrying things like the steam deck on its back too. My 5700xt doesn't work with FSR 4 or XeSS so FSR 3 is by FAR the best option.,Positive
AMD,FSR4 is much better than any DLSS that came before it too. DLSS 1 was absolute garbage. And people called it better than native.,Negative
AMD,I'd rather be given the choice. it still is faster than native and better looking than any other upscaling options.,Positive
AMD,"This is extremely game dependent. For example, on Cyberpunk on my 7800xt, FSR 4 has the same performance as one preset lower in FSR 3. So FSR 4 balanced has the same performance as FSR 3 quality.  But even FSR 4 performance looks much better than FSR 3 quality. So if you equalize visual fidelity, FSR 4 gives better performance than FSR 3.  In other games, like AC Shadows, the performance difference between FSR 4 and 3 is huge.",Neutral
AMD,Does that game support XeSS? The performance increase sounds like it's larger. That's why I'm not sure how much of an upgrade this is really.,Negative
AMD,"in 2020 AMD was openly laughing at Nvidia for its AI promotion and Lisa said it will bancrupt the company. In 2025 AMD releases their own solution. 5 years, the developement time of a chip. Turns out AMD was totally unprepared.",Negative
AMD,Vega literally doesn't have the compute support for INT8 that makes this work. Only RX 6000 and above do.,Negative
AMD,No,Neutral
AMD,He's got it the other way around. XeSS 1.3+ quality has an upscaling factor of 1.7x while FSR quality is 1.5x. XeSS quality's upscale factor is equivalent to FSR balanced.  So XeSS was actually being compared at a disadvantage here.,Neutral
AMD,"> At 15:38 Tim says that XeSS Quality has higher internal resolution than FSR4 Balanced.  You're right about Intel adjusting their naming but Tim was still comparing FSR4 Performance to XeSS Quality. At that timestamp, Tim said ""but on the balance of things..."" as in ""all things considered.""",Neutral
AMD,Forgive them for what exactly?,Negative
AMD,"Classic case of someone not watching the video and getting the takeaway.   Tim's takeaway was that even if you performance normalise and compare FSR4 INT8 performance vs FSR3.1 or XeSS Quality, FSR4 INT8 looks significantly better than both still. And it only looks better in comparison to the above two when you lower input resolution.   Your takeaway is like saying Intel should have never released the DP4a version of XeSS because it also performs much worse than FSR3.1. Bad enough that Intel changed the meaning of each quality preset to refer to the one below.",Negative
AMD,this,Neutral
AMD,"This. Some people just assume with enough performance you can ignore DLSS and FSR4, when most of modern games just look bad without any AA, slightly better with TA/FSR3/XeSS and actually good with DLSS/FSR4",Negative

AMD,For my case its to get me comfortably over 60fps in AAA games. I run a low end GPU (RX7600) and a 1440p monitor so im not getting native 1440p60. And fsr AA would lower my already sub 60 frames even more.,Neutral

AMD,"I guess the idea it's work in progress. In some cases FSR4 Q gave only 2% uplift compared to native TAA. This is just not good. Won't be surprised if in some situations FSR4 leads to perf regression.  Of course this line of thinking only good if AMD is actively developing int8 path and planning its official release.

I only bought the vega cuz during the crypto boom around 2018-2019 it was very hard to find a gpu, and i found ebay seller selling vega 56s for very cheap, which was a 1 in a million find at the time. I also made a mistake not selling it before ethereum quit gpu mining, could have gotten easily 800-900 for it. Also, even when it was getting official drivers they've always been ass and always behind nvidia on features. Amd driver team is just a bunch of windowlickers.",Negative

AMD,well yea but if its any close to dlss the quality difference you can observe is pretty small,Neutral
AMD,I'm on a 4k ultra wide and it still looks like ass. The fizzle is the exact issue i had in E33. I found it far less of an issue in other games like control which also uses TAA and RT though the upgrade to FSR4 is massive even there.,Negative
AMD,"In those numbers they forgot to include the fact that when you use FSR3/4, first you render natively at a lower resolution. So instead of rendering at 4K when you enable performance mode, you're actually rendering at 1080p. That can take a game rendering at say 20fps (50ms) down to 30fps (33ms), then you would add the render cost of FSR3/4 on top.   The numbers they explain in that post basically just forgot the first step: the performance gain from rendering at a lower resolution natively. But it holds true for the bit afterwards: adding the compute cost of the upscaling method to the frametime cost of rendering at your new rendering resolution. It doesn't actually change the numbers much in the end - your upscaling cost is entirely dependent on the compute capabilities of the GPU in question so regardless if what your framerate is before upscaling, it's going to be a fixed cost on top at any given resolution (AKA FSR4 cost in terms of frametime will be the same on the same GPU at the same resolution in all cases - even across games you should only see minor differences).",Neutral
AMD,Defending how? Are a lot of people saying that the image quality is better than DLSS 2+?,Neutral
AMD,"That is a thread from 4 years ago when people hadn't even tried the upscaler yet, and only seen it through youtube reviews. No shit that people's perspective changes over 4 years.  And most of the negative comments to that review are subjective views on DF, but that's besides the point.",Negative
AMD,"And I personally like frame gen. Not a super fan of it, but it's a nice option to have.  What I don't like about Frame gen is how it's marketed as ""free performance"", which it is not.",Positive

AMD,"\>Won't be surprised if in some situations FSR4 leads to perf regression.  No surprises needed - it is bound to be that way in some instances. Upscaling cost is close to fixed and is separated from rest of rendering cost mostly. So IF you have high enough framerates and IF lowering resolution with yield frametime reduction lower than frametime cost of FSR 4 INT8 - you will see performance decrease.  Both are not that huge of an IF tbh. FSR 4 INT8 is often mentioned to have frametime cost of over 4ms. 120fps has frametime of 8.33ms. For you to see FSR 4 INT8 giving performance increase, lowering resolution should shave more than 4ms of frametime - meaning going from 120fps to 240fps. Ain't happening.",Neutral

The FP8 files in that same Github folder were generated using a model from May 2025. It has me a little worried that the INT8 model has been shelved.  That being said, from what I've heard form others the INT8 model looks like it contains some of the weights from the FP8 model already. So nobody really knows if it will be part of the upcoming FSR Redstone release.",Negative

AMD,"Not better, but that it's either ""just as good/not that bad/can't tell the difference from DLSS"". I noticed a giant uptick in it when the 5000 series came out and people were trying to justify their AMD purchase. It's people in denial that their chosen platform can't compete.",Negative

AMD,"I like AMD but it's unclear if it's just pure underdog effect. As a an enthusiast at the high end unfortunately there is no real choice so the hope is that they can become relevant again. some rumors I've been hearing about CPU/GPU/APU/IO die fusion/tiling in the future coming from red team seems quite exciting; and it would be apt for them to get creative since they uniquely have those competencies in house. It looks like things may get a lot more interesting given Intel and Nvidia will also team up on that on-package integration side of things. On the other hand, I suppose it's more of ""integrate or die"" in the modern era where high bandwidth and low latencies are king. Apple is out there wiping the floor with everyone on power efficiency while still delivering impressive performance.",Neutral
AMD,"You can always fallback on CPU decode. Its what my old laptop used to end up doing for youtube and why it managed to actually lag on youtube viewing. Fun fact, since youtube has limited resources, most videos with lower views dont get re-coded for new codecs, so you can still find h.264 videos that a potato can run. but if you like only content with thousands/millions views you better keep your hardware up to date. which is nonissue for most people as they watch on a phone.",Neutral

AMD,"Theoretically yes, because RDNA3 could theoretically leverage WMMA for a performance improvement with INT8. I think the official rate is the same as DP4a, but I've seen attempts from people to implement FSR4 INT8 using WMMA and it actually does perform better, but it's buggy and doesn't work properly.

From what i've seen its still not on par / better than DLSS in both visual quality, features, and, maybe most important in game support.   Where the latter is not unimportant, as if you want to compete, you need to be on the field. FSR 4 can be super good, but if DLSS is in vastly more games by default (i know you can 'hack' it in often, but no one apart from a niche in the enthousiast niche is ever going to do that) its not really a competition.

AMD,"Yes but new game support doesnt require hardware, and amd couldnt be arsed to do that for more than 6 years for us vega users. I have submitted countless crash reports to amd and the devs and nothing. To this day marvel rivals still crashes with my vega 56 at least once per game. Which is not surprising given that the last new game support we had was in late 2023. Every driver since then has been just a maintenance driver, small bug fix here and there. Amd simply dont care that i cant play the game in my 8 year old gpu and it keeps crashing. And yes, i removed my overclock, tried DDU, it's just a driver issue. The game does not go well with the vega drivers and NO ONE cares, certainly not amd. While gtx 900 users have had 10+ years of driver support already.

AMD,I could not figure out if all ASRock Motherboards are affected or only certain ones?,Neutral
AMD,"I was always surprised the media didn't spend more time discussing some of the crazy launch era voltage defaults all the vendors were using. Granted with Gigabyte frying chips and ASUS frying chips plus their own motherboards honorably committing seppuku for the chipacide afterwards, there was a lot going on.  I built a system a month after AM5 launched with a 7700X and ASRock B650E Riptide Wifi motherboard. Out of the gate VSOC defaulted to 1.25v but was reported at 1.288v by ZenTimings 1.29. VDD Misc was 1.3v, and CLDO was 1.10. Currently VDD Misc defaults to 1.1v, CLDO defaults to 0.95v even when setting 6000 1:1, and now VSOC shows as red if set above even 1.23v. VSOC also now actually delivers the voltage it's set to without running above it, so either ZenTimings changed how it measures or ASRock changed its LLC setting for the VSOC rail.  Will have to finish the video later but I do wonder if Steve is factoring in the ever-mercurial voltage defaults all the vendors were using. I know ASRock personally changed and tweaked every single voltage knob & paired LLC knob that existed and was constantly changing them for the first year, and still tweaking them by year two to try and lock down the memory headaches users were having. But some of those default voltages were still nuts even when the X3D chips first launched. So if users did update UEFI versions religiously I could easily see any initial damage caused before the UEFI was updated weakening the chip, thereby triggering a belated failure later despite now running on safer voltages.",Neutral

For example, even if the board they tested already killed a CPU, maybe their new CPU has slightly tighter tolerances where it makes good contact with the pins on the board. As in, there is a minimum range of tolerances on both the CPU and the ASROCK board...and both need to hit that threshold before an issue arises.

AMD,"People were saying it also affected the 7800X3D when this mess all began... but maybe they were wrong I honestly haven't looked deeply into this to know. That being said I do know some of the voltages were remained high even after the 9000-series launched. Was literally only few a months ago when ASRock changed the UEFI to redline a VSOC setting above 1.23v, before then it was happy to set 1.25v with EXPO. Was only after trouble began this year did ASRock finally start getting conservative with its voltage settings, but the 9800X3D debuted last Nov.  Did finish the video. When Steve mentioned most of the data points were people using 1.4v kits of memory that itself seems like a flag given the warnings I've read about exceeding 1.35v, but it's also the first time I've heard it mentioned as a possible factor. Back from the 7800X3D era I remember a Buildzoid video that mentions one of the three RAM voltages that gets changed by EXPO presets will affect power plane levels within part of the IO die, and there's one voltage plane that shouldn't get too high relative to another lest it cause problems. So having that set at 1.4 seems kind of bad for multiple reasons.",Neutral
AMD,"I won't profess to be an expert on this topic. That said even if I had to run it at CL32 I still wouldn't exceed 1.35v, but that's me. Remember DDR5 official specification calls for 1.1v.",Neutral
AMD,"Haha I knew it was a risk, but 20 years ago I was building hot-off-the-press overclocking rigs, the (mostly GB) boards would usually have early beta and one time even an alpha level BIOSs.   With AM5 it was the best, smoothest system build I've had in 15 years, in large part I credit the SK Hynix memory for that. Microcenter dropped its promo bundle price while at the same time upgraded the 'free' RAM kit to SK Hynix so I couldn't hold out any longer. I have no regrets and wouldn't change a thing if I had to do it over again, even the same ASRock B650E Riptide board. The 32GB 6000 turned out to be a kit of Hynix A die that I could halve the timings on on stock volts, SK Hynix puts out some crazy good stuff sometimes. That being said I did lower a lot of the crazy voltages ASRock defaulted to in the first year once I had a rough idea on what everything was.",Positive
AMD,"Outside of Hardware Unboxed, who even reviews motherboards properly anymore?",Negative
AMD,True! Just had constant crashes with EXPO enabled at 6000 and 1.4v went to manually tighter timings and 1.35 and it flies xD,Negative
AMD,I have no problem with AsRock but this is a real problem with this model AsRock,Negative
AMD,"more than that, but for those they could as well have died on other manufacturer's boards as the amounts are smaller and too close to noise to judge. we also did not have this phenomenon back when 9000-series did not exist, even though the same or similar asrock boards were out there.",Negative
AMD,If you look at the ASRock mega thread there are still people reporting 7800x3d deaths even on the latest bios.,Neutral
AMD,"the way the voltage rules work is that you want VDDIO to be relatively high compared to both vsoc and vddp, though i don't know if the latter is about other than vddp being derived from vddio.  vsoc < vddio + 100mV  vddp < vddio - 100mV",Neutral
AMD,"I think my 7800X3D might have been slightly damaged by ASRock board. I've had a lot of issues in the past, where at first it worked fine and then after a while it would start throwing memory errors and crashing. Then updated the BIOS and it worked fine for another month and started throwing memory errors again. Many BIOS updates later and it now refuses to run 6000 memory at VSOC lower than 1.23V, it just becomes unstable. So I'm running it at 1.23 for few months already and so far it works fine, but seeing other people can run the same memory at 1.12-1.15V and the fact that it was working fine when I first built it makes me think that it was already slightly degraded by the motherboard.",Negative
AMD,"guru3d, techpowerup",Neutral
AMD,"Hard to say really unless it continually needs higher and higher voltages. But back when the 7800X3D launched VSOC was still running higher volts than I what it was set to in the UEFI, as reported by ZenTimings. So if that is accurate it could explain why it worked when you first built it, because today VSOC values are reported below the UEFI setting.",Neutral
AMD,"I updated the BIOS for the first time only after it became unstable, so there was no change on my side between working fine and throwing memory errors and crashing every few minutes. First BIOS update fixed the issue for about a month and then it returned. After that, I couldn't make it run at 6000, so I've been running it at 5800 for more than half a year (tried updating BIOS few more times every now and then), until someone on reddit helped me debug the issue and turns out, bumping VSOC to 1.23 made it run stable again. It's running like this for about 2-3 months, so far without any issues.  By the way, I also do not shutdown my PC very often, usually I put it to sleep. Right now my PC is at 12 day uptime and only because I updated kernel and had to reboot. 30-60 day is probably average uptime between restarts. My PC is connected to UPS.",Negative
AMD,"Again it's hard to say, there's not enough data points yet. If it continues to require higher and higher VSOC settings then that would be the only real confirmation.   Kits without EXPO and kits based on Samsung/Micron die are notoriously problematic in their own right, when I installed a non-EXPO kit I had to resort to manually tuning the resistance & drive voltages just to get it stable at spec ratings. EXPO is more than just primary timings, it stores subtimings, voltages, and impedance/drive strength settings in the profile, and EXPO is a MUST for AM5 (and probably every future AMD platform) just to avoid running into problems.",Neutral
AMD,"My kit has EXPO and it's the 2nd kit. I have replaced it already thinking it was faulty memory, but my previous kit also had EXPO. Ofc replacing the memory didn't change anything, both could run at 5800 max with default SOC voltage (1.2V).   Yes, I don't have more data points, I wasn't even looking at the voltages before (usually I don't touch stuff I don't know anything about). I only know it started spontaneously and so far it doesn't look like it's getting worse. I suspect it was an older BIOS that did something to my CPU, that is already fixed in the current BIOS and hopefully it will not progress further. It would have been weird if my CPU required 1.23V from the start, where literally everyone else just turns on EXPO profile on their memories and ""it just works"", but it doesn't in my case.",Neutral
AMD,"As I've said elsewhere, when I first built my rig the board defaulted to 1.25v. And whether it was accurate or not, Zentimings reported 1.288v as the actual reading. So it's no surprise stuff would 'just work', manufacturers were just brute forcing it for the first two years.  Requiring 1.23v in of itself isn't a problem, Samsung/Micron stuff tend to need higher volts even for just 6000 operation. It's only if the voltage required continues to increase will you have your answer.",Neutral
AMD,">It would have been weird if my CPU required 1.23V from the start, where literally everyone else just turns on EXPO profile on their memories and ""it just works"", but it doesn't in my case.  Silicon lottery and VSOC is quite a random one indeed, yea usually 6000MT/s doesn't require much, but 1.23 isn't that much more than what most ppl would use at 6000.",Neutral
AMD,"Both of my kits are Hynix. As I said, it started spontaneously, without me touching the BIOS. If it was at 1.25 by default then it shouldn't become unstable out of thin air, few months after building the PC.",Neutral

AMD,with your budget you would definitely be able to build a pc below 1500 with the specs you have as long as you are deal hunting. Also the 7500f is a decent cpu but games are getting harder to run.

But I'd also be content if a 5060ti 16gb were deeply discounted.   Puget benchmarks are a good reference point too.",Neutral
AMD,"I just bought a used 3080 Ti for 370€. At that price point, no card from the newer generations can remotely hold a candle to this old flagship. It's roughly on par with an RTX 5070, which costs upwards of 550€.",Neutral
AMD,"out of interest, why only nvidia?",Neutral
AMD,"5060ti is probably the only option for new cards but with the way the pcb/power delivery is setup on these and the 5070s, there might be legitimate concerns about reliability past 3 years warranty period.",Neutral
AMD,Why focus only on Nvidia? Nvidia and AMD are pretty equal in Resolve as far as performance goes.  The cheapest options for you are a 5060 Ti 16 GB or an RX 9060 XT 16 GB.,Positive
AMD,"This is really the only option for you OP, unless you include used options (4060 ti 16gb, 2080 ti, 3080 come to mind, as well as some workstation cards with 10gb+ vram)",Neutral
AMD,"I’ll definitely look into this, thanks for suggesting it",Positive
AMD,"I was wondering this too, I’m extremely impulsive and bought a pre-built pc instead of just building my own and now I’m paying for it 😭",Negative
AMD,the lowest I’m seeing for it is around $550,Neutral
AMD,"What do you like to edit? I would say I edit for fun but I feel like if I didn’t have to fight with my GPU to handle what I’m trying to do I’d take it more seriously. For now, I’m mostly editing gameplay but would like to start doing short films in the future. Also, thanks for the information on Puget benchmarks",Positive
AMD,"jeez, nice! I’m learning that I really do have to start practicing patience and stop being so impulsive lmao",Positive
AMD,What about 5070ti,Neutral
AMD,NVENC & Nvidia broadcaster app. As far as I’m aware AMD doesn’t have an app equal to the Nvidia broadcaster app. Being that I stream too I’m drawn to the effects that that software has.,Neutral
AMD,I’ll look into this. How do you think my CPU will fair with the 5060 Ti?,Neutral
AMD,Just want to say bensy's advice is good. Look on the second hand markets for a 4070 super. Considerably better than a 5060ti.,Positive
AMD,"On r/hardwareswap they are coming down in price. I got mine for 425 shipped. I've seen one or two go for 400, but they get snapped up really fast at that price. BUT a few months ago they were closer to 500. It helps that the 5070 (which is bit better than the 4070 super) is selling at MSRP, sometimes even going on sale to 499.",Neutral
AMD,"Performs very close to a 5070. So if you can find one at a good price, that's the best call",Positive
AMD,I had the 6700xt for 5+ years and man that thing was tuff,Negative
AMD,"Well some lessons are kinda expensive. You should also upgrade your RAM to a 32gb kit, it will greatly help with video editing",Neutral
AMD,"About anything really,  just whatever seems interesting fun.   I've tried short film style videos but I like gaming content, I like creating content in the style of  SummoningSalt, Zeltik, PokemonChallenges, Vaati. So, more info/story based.   I really enjoy motion components, once I found Resolve/Fusion, I was hooked for quite a while.   I know what you mean about fighting the system/lag. I first tried Davinci, it was on a 5500u. A middle-ground at best laptop CPU w/APU. It was always a fight for ""GPU"" errors, lag. But I'm thankful that it taught me optimizations.   Transitioned to a 6700k pretty quickly with a 1660ti and felt like I was on a spaceship compared. I saved up a bit and had planned to go AM5, but 14600k dropped in price, keeping DDR4 seemed like a nobrainer, pretty budget oriented. Got mine new for about 150USD, with 5 year warranty. I recently got in a better position with work (promotion) but it's consuming my free time which is another reason I don't need a crazy GPU currently and am content waiting.   I still spend free time learning Resolve and watching videos from CaseyFarris who I'm extremely thankful for.   Either way, to reply better now that I've had some coffee...   If you are absolutely set on picking up a GPU right now with 400USD as the budget, I'll speak towards being in the US. A used 3080/ti would probably fit the bill and still allow some wiggle for a PSU, which the higher end 30 series is hungry. A 4070 could also probably be had. But my local used has them around 400, may as well skip to a new 5070 for that price though. That would get you moving currently. Then could potentially sell for a 5070ti Super down the road. Which would have 2 encoders and hopeful that the Super refresh has more VRAM. I've eyed the 9060xt but Puget has some good benchmarks and even though it's excellent for gaming, I still plan to keep with Nvidia.   Happy to chat more too!",Positive
AMD,"5070ti uses 15-16 phase vrm for 300 watts, which should be significantly better than 5070vputting 250 watts through 9 phase vrm.",Positive
AMD,"AMD's encoder on RDNA4 is pretty much on par with Nvidia.  As for the features, it's all readily available through Adrenalin. The only thing I find is missing is the fact that you can add a background on Nvidia.  Here you can see a comparison between RDNA3 and RDNA4 and also the features you get. https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin/video-streaming.html",Positive
AMD,I've found AMD's software actually much better to use compared to NVIDIA's comparing 3070 ti and 9060 xt,Positive
AMD,"The 5700 should handle it fine, more or less. In terms of raw performance it's around the Ryzen 5 5500 but with 8 cores (which is good for streaming) but honestly for the future I would start looking into an AM5 platform",Positive
AMD,"If its the 5700 non x, not great. The 5700 non x is a 5700g without the igpu, which means it performs significantly worse than the 5600/x/5700x.",Negative
AMD,where do you guys go to find second hand parts?,Neutral
AMD,"haha you’re right, it’s all good tho cause my gf is eyeing my pc which will give me an excuse to build my own in the future with better knowledge & yeah i did buy 2 16gb sticks",Positive
AMD,what AMD gpu would you suggest,Neutral
AMD,"Thanks, as I’m doing my research it’s definitely in my radar to get an AM5 platform",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, it’s not the non x 😭",Negative
AMD,Facebook marketplace and local gaming forums also can work. And get local if you can to minimize getting scammed.,Neutral
AMD,r/hardwareswap. Ebay prices are way higher. $500 for a 4070 super is the best price you'll find. Other cards are similarly inflated.,Negative
AMD,"DaVinci loves VRAM and well, since you will not be upgrading anytime soon, a 9060XT 16GB would be great. Also, getting an 8GB card in 2025 is a big no-no. Performance is about 5% slower than a 5060 Ti, so it all depends on price. The 9070 (non XT) is miles faster, but probably too expensive. It completely destroys the 5070 (non Ti) as well.",Positive
AMD,"Great, itll handle it fine.",Positive
AMD,"I’ll have to check it out, thanks for the info. Have you notice if that subreddit is super scammy or is it legit for the most part?",Neutral
AMD,"9060XT 16GB is the absolute greatest value right now IMHO. It's doing me great, even in heavily unoptimized games like Tarkov. (1080p)",Positive
AMD,oh I’m well aware of Davinci and VRAM. I went to the fusion page to create some VFX and it looked like a stop motion with all the stuttering it was doing lol,Neutral
AMD,It's legit. If you buy from someone with confirmed trades you're fine. The issue will probably be that you don't have confirmed trades and people are worried about you being the scammer.,Neutral
AMD,"Upgrading to the am5 platform first is definitely the better play, and as for whether you should rebuild or upgrade, that really depends on if you want to spend the time, rebuilding does leave you with the chance to sell your old pc or give it to someone else if you wanted, and with dated parts like that a full rebuild to am5 would be quite expensive",Positive
AMD,Throw windows 10 iot ltsc 21h2 on that and resell it for $150 or keep it.   Go with a brand new PC.  You'll nickle and dime yourself to death staying on AM4.,Negative
AMD,Almost everything has to upgrade to switch to am5 and a better gpu. Only thing you could keep is storage and case but I bet your storage isn’t great.   I’d do a complete new build. Keep the old one and either set it up as a r/homelab or r/moonlightstreaming,Negative
AMD,"If you have parts that work with the new parts you want, makes no sense not to reuse them. Whether that’s a new build or an upgrade, well…that’s when you get into Ship of Theseus territory, isn’t it?  I bought a prebuilt years ago. Over the years I’ve added a second NVME drive and an HDD, then upgraded the RAM, then the GPU, then the power supply, then the CPU which meant upgrading the motherboard and RAM a second time. At this point the only original components left are the OS drive, the cooler, the case, and the case fans. Is it still a prebuilt? Is it even still the same computer?  Hell if I know. But I guess my answer is “slowly upgrade”. It’s like building a new PC but in slow motion.",Neutral
AMD,"Everyone's saying to go AM5, but you can still get a significant CPU upgrade on AM4 with a $140 [5800XT](https://www.microcenter.com/product/682196/amd-ryzen-7-5800xt-vermeer-am4-380ghz-8-core-boxed-processor-wraith-prism-cooler) (assuming you can access the Cambridge MC since you posted in r/boston).

AMD,"Wasn't the RX 580 rated poorly in its class? I might be thinking of a different one.   Either way, psu + gpu = easy upgrade if you can find good deals. The ram situation is what it is, you should want a better board for that.",Negative
AMD,"A lot of your components are significantly newer than 8 years old.  The most obvious upgrade would be your CPU, but also requires a new motherboard and RAM. You'll also likely need a new PSU at the same time.",Neutral
AMD,Oh shit you probably need to upgrade that PSU to at least 750w as well,Negative
AMD,"Your CPU mainly, but at 4K you are GPU limited, so a faster CPU will not help at all. At 4K most CPUs will perform the same.  Actually, just have a look at this [video](https://youtu.be/aYYVz4q-Rt8). At 4K they are almost the same lol, with a +-3 fps difference. Stay with this setup, learn about PBO and apply it (and RAM OC, but requieres more things).",Neutral
AMD,Thank you will look at new cpus probably will try and stick to AMD I class it as 8 years old PC as it's not considered a new system until you change the motherboard from my understanding.,Neutral
AMD,Yeah been running fine so far though lol as CPU doesn't use more than 100 watts I'm assuming the newer ones use more though 😜,Positive
AMD,Yeap I've enabled auto PBO and got the cpu overclocked to 4.85ghz for newer higher end games I just use FSSR4 etc to upscale from a lower resolution to 4k. I'm assuming the 5700x3D isn't worth the upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,Okay well change the b motherboard and RAM and new CPU and you're golden,Positive
AMD,"Auto PBO it's trash BTW.... And yeah, the upgrade isn't worth it.",Negative
AMD,Any you recommend I would probably go to Ryzen 7 9800X3D and a Gigabyte B850 motherboard and 64GB ram.,Neutral
AMD,All good choices,Positive
AMD,Any price above \~225-250€ is not worth it for the x3d am4 chips unless your market has severely messed up am5 prices for some reason ig.,Negative
AMD,"No, it is not worth that price. you should just upgrade to AM5 with a bit more.  I feel like at most the 5800x3d should be around is 300 USD. that's when I'll probably change to it. Or get am6 by that time.",Negative
AMD,5700x3d or AM5,Neutral
AMD,"Well if you're not looking to do a platform upgrade to am5, the 5800x3d is the best gaming cpu you can get that would fit your current platform  As for the price, get a used one, i bought one used over a year ago as a part of a system, and after selling all the parts i didn't need i broke even while keeping the cpu, ram, 1tb ssd, and psu",Positive
AMD,"Depends on the cost of a 7500f / 7600 + low end B650 or B850 board + 32gb of DDR5 6000mhz RAM, even a single stick of 16gb is acceptable since it runs in dual channel",Neutral
AMD,400€ is budget am5 upgrade lol,Neutral
AMD,"not a good price. you can find a 5800XT which is better value. Or go with AM5, tho its not the best time due to high DDR5 prices",Negative
AMD,"No, go for 7800x3d",Neutral
AMD,"If you can spend 500 on a cpu you can probably buy a b650 motherboard, 32gb ddr5 ram and a 7800x3d for 600±",Neutral
AMD,"Sell your old parts, get a B650/B650E and a 7600 or a 7500F (whichever is cheaper). Get some 6000mhz cl30 DDR5 32gb Hynix and you’re set.",Neutral
AMD,"5800X3D stopped being manufactured some time ago and was replaced by 5700X3D, which is also slowly being phased out. So the price that you are seeing is probably from some old stock, that is waiting for someone not aware of the market.  You can get a new 9800X3D for that price. So I would rather go for AM5 upgrade and reclaim some costs by selling your old parts. B650 motherboards are not that expensive and should work more than fine with 9800X3D. Or you can go for cheaper 7800X3D as a compromise to lower cost.  But first, ask yourself if you need your PC to edit fast or game fast. If you need productivity and your software is CPU bound, then even new 5950X are cheap now. It will improve your gaming performance and it will crush 3700X in productivity. It will be slower than any X3D chip in gaming. It will also be a drop-in upgrade.",Neutral
AMD,moving to AM5 should be more cost efficient. 7500f + 32gb 6000mhc cl30 + whatever b850 board that has the needed features for you.,Neutral
AMD,"400-500 euros is too much. You could probably go am5 for not too much more - but i wouldn't recommend that. If you can find a used 5800x3d or 5700x3d for example, it would be much more reasonable",Negative
AMD,Thanks for all the tips. Does anyone have any real comparisons in games?  How big is the difference here? Regardless of the price.,Positive
AMD,"Depending on your market, with 400-500eu you can get decent AM5 mobo+cpu+ddr5.",Neutral
AMD,"5800X3D won't perform much better in Photo and Video Editing so it's not worth that price only for gaming.  If you afford it upgrade to AM5 with a 9800X3D, then you have the best Gaming CPU for CS2 and it is also much better in application performance compared to 5800X3D/7800X3D. It will compliment your next GPU Upgrade in the future for sure.",Neutral
AMD,"get a used 5700x3d with reasonable price, if you can't then AM5 is the only option.",Neutral
AMD,"You've convinced me, I'll probably go for the 7800x3d. Any tips for motherboard and RAM? I currently have an AIO cooling system and don't know if it will fit on the new socket.  Habe alles in weiß gehalten.",Neutral
AMD,"I did upgrade on April this year (3700x -> 5700x3d) and I was surprised how many games, such as FS2020, gained huge fps increases. I have 3080TI. Definitely worth it, I payed ~250€.",Positive
AMD,"Not really worth it imo. I’d save up for an upgrade to a 7800X3D, or a 9800X3D if you can afford it.   You’ll have to upgrade your motherboard and RAM as well, it came up to roughly $500 USD in my area, especially if you know where to shop.",Negative
AMD,Back when you could get it cheap and AM5 wasn't really an option yes.  Now absolutely not,Neutral
AMD,"Only at $200 or less. If it costs anything more you're better off selling your cpu, mobo and ram to hop on AM5",Neutral
AMD,"Look for 5700x, still an upgrade but 3x cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,"Went from 3700x to 5700x3d,  for me the upgrade was not worth the 180€ i payed for that CPU.  All games that ran fine before run fine afterwards,  the games that struggled, struggled with a few frames more (aka 40fps to 50 fps)     Personaly ifound that high FPS is less important to me than conistency,  e.G.  i play better on steady 60Fps and steady 31ms Ping,  than on 140 to 300 Fps and 9 to 20 ping.  Found the fps part out by accident when i globaly locked my fps to 60     TLDR:  5000x3d ain't wortht he asking price currently, go full upgrade or wait  May give capped fps (or rather AMD chill) for more consitend frames a go",Negative
AMD,"Check for the price of 5950x on Amazon, of you are prepared to pay around 250€, it is a monster CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"It might be a good choice if you're on a budget. However, you can probably go for AM5 with €500 depending on the prices in your place.",Positive
AMD,Can't you upgrade to am5 for 500usd? Like a mobo and ram and maybe get a 7500f that is similar in performance to 5700x3d. In the country I'm living the prices are dictated by popularity and AM4 is more popular here so it costs the same as AM5 chips and mobos. AM5 would definitely give you more flexibility and you could look out for offers on a bigger variety of chips.,Neutral
AMD,"Last good time to get an AM4 x3d chip was early this year on aliexpress for about €160, they've stopped production so prices increased. It's better to invest in AM5 now.",Neutral
AMD,Not for that price hell no. For $100. MAYBE $200,Negative
AMD,"For you, a 5900x for $150-180 (used in the US anyway) might be an option. You'll get a big boost for productivity and a decent boost in gaming, without breaking the bank. This would probably hold you over until AM6",Positive
AMD,"yes and no  the cpu is worth upgrading to but its stock is pretty empty and for the price youd pay for a 5800x3D, 5700x3D youre better off just going AM5 now",Negative
AMD,"unless you can find 5700x3d or 5800x3d for under 200$ USD, don't buy",Negative
AMD,"For that money, likely not. I did the same upgrade when 7000 series came out, but I got my x3d chip for ~$200 after selling my 3700X  Is x3d worth it? Absolutely. For you considering the cost versus a whole new motherboard platform? Eehhhh, no. Go 9000 series if you want a performance boost. 9700X is similar to the 5800x3d, any of the new x3d chips will be a further performance boost, game/resolution/GPU dependant",Neutral
AMD,"A 5800X3D would be a fantastic upgrade to your system that would keep it relevant for a good while, but that is too expensive. Maybe you can find a 5700X3D instead (<$300)?",Positive
AMD,Are you only running 1 stick of RAM? Two is faster.,Neutral
AMD,"Yup, nope, after reading the full text do am5 if you're going to  spend that much.",Negative
AMD,"I went from a 3900X to a 5800X3D. The multicore performance is not much lower on the 5800X3D, but the single core performance is better and for gaming it made big, in some cases huge difference.",Positive
AMD,"I upgraded from 3700x to 5800x3d ...2 years ago for around €200 second hand. Absolutely worth the upgrade then, but I would never pay €400!",Positive
AMD,No  5700x or AM5.,Neutral
AMD,"To give you my 5 cents, I am in a similar position, gaming in 2k with 3080 tuf, tomahawk 450 2.0, 32gig of 3600 mhz corsair and ryzen 5 3600x. Was thinking of doing the same as you, going for 5700x3d or 5800x3d but had a second thought and I think I will wait for how long this configuration will hold on, because it is handling everything with no issues. Maybe I will reach am6 haha. As for you, I woukd offer to go for better graphics instead of the processor.",Neutral
AMD,"Nope, for that price is cheaper getting a CPU+MOBO bundle (Intel or AMD) and get better performance. Also, 5000X3D chips are bad for productivity. If you want a good GPU for 4K edition, any Intel chip with an iGPU will do it just fine.",Negative
AMD,"I'm in almost the same boat as you (ryzen 3800x) and ended up jumping on the 5900xt (from my understanding is its just a underclocked 5950x) for 250 usd last week on Amazon. I also dabble in productivity with more large data analysis (SPSS, SAS) and lots of Civ so I figured it would be a decent swap and my plan is to just do a full new build in about 2 years and use my current setup hooked directly up to my living room tv as a pseudo console. It's pretty annoying to figure out the upgrade path right now since so many of the posts regarding upgrades from our chips are from before the discontinued production of the 5800x3d and 5700x3d.",Neutral
AMD,Nahh i would just go am 5 or save for it.  Am4 5800x3ds aint worth for that price.,Negative
AMD,"I did the same upgrade but for 5700x3D. I've noticed performance increase. It was non-boxed version of 5700x3D (Tray) and only payed 150€. I will most likely skip AM5 completely as my games like WoT, Far Cry exc. runs smoothly @1440p without any issues.",Positive

AMD,2nd hand is good option. CPUs are safe to buy 2nd hand.,Positive
AMD,"So you’re paying less, for similar 5800x3d performance, and to get on a new platform",Neutral
AMD,"If it's for gaming then I would go for AM5 and 7800X3D or 9800X3D if you already planned to spend €500 for CPU alone.  Have in mind that (maybe except CS2) your GPU will be a huge limiting factor after you upgrade your CPU. You performance gains in games will be limited by it and until you upgrade your GPU, your new CPU won't see a high utilization.  You will get a bump in performance in productivity as well (newer CPU architecture, more memory bandwidth with DDR5, higher clocks), but it won't be huge, since core count on those CPUs is the same.  Like I previously wrote, 7800X3D (especially tray version), might be a good middle ground. In Poland tray versions cost €40-€50 less than box ones and are similar to 7700X in price. This with B650 motherboard and a 32GB 6000MT CL30 DDR5 should make your upgrade more budget friendly, while keeping 80-90% of performance gains that 9800X3D would give you.",Neutral
AMD,"Lol, the GOAT. Enjoy!",Positive
AMD,"Lower latency ram might helo, but you are the Task Manager (ctrl+alt+delete) detective. You must look at stats while performing tasks to understand how system is responding. 100 Hz display tho? Are you hitting that limit while gaming?  Intel is still better for general productivity and 14600K is on sale in many regions. Intel can also handle faster RAM than AM5 unless you have APU and that makes a difference, too (even tho most benchmark comparisons run 6000 MT/s on both and can effectively handicap Intel or APU).",Neutral

IMO buying 5700X3D right now for the price of 400$ is not wise. If it'd be like 250, yeah, sure. But not at this price.",Positive
AMD,Just upgraded from i7 6700K to 3600... 58€ boxed new+60€ aorus elite b550m. Kept ram and everything else. I guess 5600 was worth it for 100€ but I'm capped at 120 fps and an rx 6600 so not worth spending anymore. My main rig is an am5 tough 7500f&rx 9060xt 16g totally rocks it.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you!,Positive
AMD,"omg i have that cpu and just buy the same card its actually on way to arribe soon and was kind of worried of bottlenenecking even the test says the exact as you that in 2k and 4k there is not and where it is is at 1k and is just 2 to 4% , i think i can safely now hunt for specials went i wana move to am5 socket , THanksS!!",Neutral
AMD,"Yup. Don't sweat it, you're golden with that setup.   And don't forget. The tests may even say that, in 1080p (if for whatever reason you choose to play games like that when you have THIS GOOD equipment), it's 2-4%. You ~~won't~~ can't see that in day to day gaming. Like, literally your eye won't register it.   Anyway, after I just bought 5070ti, I'll make a switch to AM5 (if at all before AM6), when The Witcher 4 comes out or GTA 6. Both of those games on PC won't be here untill 2027. I *really* doubt I will play something more demanding and/or new-ish untill then. For now, absolutely everything works in 4K in mostly ultra details (aside from uber raytracing of course) and I expect it to work like that in next 2-3 years worth of games.",Positive
AMD,I mean if u want more CPU power then get more CPU power. The 7600x is a great little chip for entry level builds that really packs a punch but a 7800x3d is on a whole other tier of performance. If u want the absolute most out of that 9070xt then a 7800x3d is the better choice.  Though u should only get the 7800x3d if u are comfortable spending that much money,Positive
AMD,"Tbh u won't really need the r7 for my summer car, the 7600x will run it just fine but if you can afford it go for it, won't have to upgrade anytime soon if u do so",Positive
AMD,Im just making my own first build and choose to get the 7600x with 9070xt over the 7800x3D with the mindset that the money saved there could go into getting a better 1440p monitor.,Neutral
AMD,Amazon has the 7800x3d right now for $319,Neutral
AMD,"Definitely 7800x3d in my opinion.   However, it may be a choke point for your 9070xt--you won't get best performance.  If you could afford it, I would say 9800x3d but that is probably 100 euros more.  Another option:  combine 7800x3d with RX 9070 for a better CPU/GPU match.  The money saved from going 9070xt to 9070 should cover the extra euros for the 7800x3d.",Negative
AMD,alr ty,Neutral
AMD,"Wdym the 7800x3d is going to choke the 9070XT?? There’s a whole lot of scenarios, the majority actually, where the choke point would in fact be the 9070XT. It would all come down to a variety of factors like resolution and expected frame rates, among many others. This above is just not true most of the time in most scenarios.",Negative
AMD,"well, i saw a 9070xt pulse for 590 euros in olx so i dont think i can get less than it even for a rx9070",Neutral
AMD,"OK.  To your original question; I would still go with the 7800x3d if you can afford it.  You won't get maximum performance, but it should still be very good!",Positive
AMD,you clearly have no clue what you are talking about.,Negative
AMD,No  people usually underclock so their rigs run quieter,Neutral
AMD,"Overclocking is when you push your CPU/GPU to its limits. It used to be more of a thing back in the day, but now its become very niche since some parts come overclocked from the factory. Realistically if you're just planning on playing games on your PC, you don't really need to. If you want to really push your 9060 XT to the very limit and play Cyberpunk at 4k at 360Hz, yes you will need to overclock, but even then you may not be able to achieve that. You would be better off buying a new GPU",Neutral
AMD,Overclocking is rarely worth it nowadays.  Undervolting on the other hand is a great way to finetune your card. With a stable UV the card will run cooler while gaining performance.,Positive
AMD,"Not anymore, no. You used to be able to get 25-30% more CPU performance, but modern CPU's boost pretty effectively.",Neutral
AMD,"As someone who builds/repairs/maintains computers both at work and at home, no, not really.   If you want better performance you should buy better parts. Just like how with cars ""there's no replacement for displacement"" is true, with PCs it's very similar. You either have the performance or you don't, and it's not worth the headache to get 10 more fps out of your rig at the risk of instability when you can just buy better parts and run stock or turn your settings down and run rock solid stable.",Negative
AMD,If you're asking the question then probably not. Undervolding is generally better to extend the life of your CPU while maintaining performance,Neutral
AMD,"Modern chips include what would be considered overclocking in their ""boost"" form.",Neutral
AMD,Nah,Positive
AMD,not anymore. if you wanted to push your edge at the peak of tech sure but for anyone running anything normal there is no reason anymore,Neutral
AMD,I’ve found overclocking ram with XMP to be acceptable.  No point in anything else for normal operation,Neutral
AMD,"Parts generally overclock on their own out of the box, for memory you need to enable the setting in the bios though. Overclocking beyond that may give you a tiny bit of extra performance, but probably not enough to notice much. It's fun to try if you're into it, but that's about it.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, usually when you're buying mid-level to high-end hardware and you want to get that extra 10-20% performance out of it, if you tune it correctly and can cool the extra heat, you get better game performance.   If you are playing low demand games or mostly just browse the web and watch videos, there's not much point.",Positive
AMD,"I don’t understand all these anti-overclockers.  Maybe they are working with hardware that is not as easy to overclock (like a 7800x3d).  My 9800 X3D is overclocked and undervolted and happy as a clam. Not only runs at a higher boost clock, but it runs at that higher boost clock MORE of the time. It’s an incredible CPU to overclock. There is so much performance left on the table and it runs so cool.   My 4090.has a core overclock and vram overclock, never exceeds 75c in a tropical country.",Positive
AMD,"There are always exceptions like overclocking a 5080 yields great results. But generally, its not worth it.",Negative
AMD,ok I guess I don't really understand what overclocking is then,Negative
AMD,Undervolt*  Undervolting is essentially the new overclocking. It's free performance that often also lowers temps and power draw.  Not many people are intentionally underclocking.,Neutral
AMD,"underclocking canhelp with noise and temperature control, especially if you're not pushing your PC to its limits... For most casual users, it's often more practical than overclocking.",Positive
AMD,Yes   People usually overclock so their rigs perform better,Neutral
AMD,"its ok, the most demanding games I have are BF6 and KCD2. BF6 runs consistently at like 100+ fps on high 1440p so I am satisfied.",Positive
AMD,Correct. Best you can do is undervolt so it runs cooler and can boost even higher,Neutral
AMD,"Its when you increase the performance of the chip by increasing the voltage and therefore the speed.  It used to be good 10 years ago, but todays chips are so precisely binned you cant get out much of a performance upgrade",Neutral
AMD,"Making the thingy run faster. Running faster requires more energy, which produces more heat, which requires greater cooling.  Your cpu/gpu will auto adjust how fast it's gotta go on its own based on your cooling setup and the manufacturer's design, so there's no reason to care about it except to have internet points.  The only overclock that actually matters for you to do is ram by enabling xmp/expo. This let's the ram run at the advertised speed on the box",Neutral
AMD,"Around the 1990s when overclocking first really gained traction, there were situations where you could literally double the performance of a machine in certain combinations (80486 processors in particular had a multiplier that could allow you to buy a significantly cheaper chip, and run it at nearly the performance of the high end ones).  Overclocking is still around, but more hobby focused now. In some combinations you can still get good gains, but no where near the 100% uplift of the old generations.",Positive
AMD,"It is something that happens automaticaly.  Back in the day - late '90's, early 2000's - people learned to increase the frequency of the chip through different tricks.  Overclock the chip from what the manufacturer rated it.  If you were very careful you could get something out of it.  If you were not careful the chip would overheat and self destruct.  And in all likelyhood you reduced the lifespan of the chip.  For a little while there was some back and forth.  Think of any other back and forth battle between users and controlling industry.  It was that.  Then....  Mobo manufacturers started putting heat sensing diodes on the mobo.  AHAHA! Protection from the CPU overheating.  Your mobo would underclock or shut down before it caught fire.  Then CPU manufacturers put the diodes on the chip itself....  Which brings us current.  The chips overclock themselves without you doing anything at all.  They have heat sensing diodes built in.  They watch there own temperature and they control the voltage according to that.  The better the cooling you put on, the more the chip can push itself.  The only thing you really need to do is supply adequate cooling.  You don't do anything else.  And it is safe.  However....  There are still people not happy with that that want to get adventurous and push things stupid far.  Good for them.  They do stuff like 'de-lid' and come up with impressive cooling strategies.  Truth is, you don't get much bang for that buck.  There is a risk/reward thing going on here and if you just leave stuff be there is no real risk.  -----------  'People underclock so their rigs run quieter'.  You underclock so your rig runs quieter.  I use Noctua and BeQuiet! fans.  Those things are the real deal.  There are good reasons to undervolt.  Look into it.  But if you want quite look into those companies they have good products that work as advertised.",Neutral
AMD,What ive meant is nowadays its rare that people overclock cause its not worth it,Neutral
AMD,Then don't worry about overclocking lol. You won't have any issues,Neutral
AMD,"ohh ok, basicially what I thought then.   Yeah, my gpu came with a factory oc so no point in messing with it",Neutral
AMD,"expo makes my monitor not turn on, i just manually set it to 5600 mhz, ig i could try 5800 though (my ram is advertised as 6000)",Negative
AMD,"It's never been easier and theres still performance gains to be had. Literally no reason not to, especially gpu since it's so damn easy and you can get 10+% performance boost. Cpu only overclock that if you're into competitive games and want better 1% lows",Positive
AMD,"idk, just wanted to ask",Neutral
AMD,Yes that factory OC makes almost no difference either.  Thats why people downclock sometimes cause you get almost the same performance with way less heat/noise.  But ye i wouldnt recommend to mess with it with anyone tbh unless theyre ready to deepdive into the topic,Negative
AMD,"It reduces the life of your rig, increases the likelihood of crashes,because your system to run louder and increases cost for a fraction of the performance increase",Negative
AMD,my stuff runs cool anyways. Thanks for info!,Positive
AMD,"Nah man not really true.   1. Overclocking might see your chip last 20 years instead of 22. So who cares? Chips last incredibly long. It will be ewaste before any degradation from overclocking comes into play.  2. Modern coolers are almost always overkill, more than enough to handle overclocking. Noise and temps will likely be marginally different if you have proper air flow  3. Crashes? Just make sure your overclock is stable and adjust if necessary.   4. 10-15% performance increases are nothing to scoff at. That 10-15% is probably worth almost 100 bucks in silicon seeing how that's almost about the difference between gpu tiers.  Only real reason not to overclock is if you live in an area with really high electricity costs",Negative
AMD,I dont agree with the dude but it definitely doesnt decrease your rigs life. And the cost increase is barely measurable...,Negative
AMD,"Overclocking/undervolting only results in crashes if you push it too far. Just about every CPU and GPU has headroom for better performance out of the box, without causing any stability issues. Some more than others.  You're also not reducing the lifespan of your chip in any meaningful capacity. You'd be unstable far before you pushed enough voltage to damage a chip.",Negative
AMD,Yeah so I see we've reached the point where you're just going to lie endlessly. Have nice a day,Negative
AMD,Dude what😂😂,Negative
AMD,All looks good but for the storage a m.2 ssd will be better for the games and try to get a cl30 ram kit instead of cl36,Positive

AMD,thermalright phantom spirit or peerless assassin will cool it fine,Neutral
AMD,"The 5800X can get a bit toasty while boosting, a good 120mm tower (think the Hyper 212 class of coolers) can handle it but can get a bit noisy. Any of the dual-tower coolers (the ones with 2 fin stacks/2 fans) like the ID-Cooling A620, or Thermalright Peerless/Phantom Assassins/RK, will work great - just get whichever is cheapest/most aesthetically pleasing to you.",Neutral

AMD,"[https://amzn.eu/d/dcB1WM8](https://amzn.eu/d/dcB1WM8) So you say this one would be fine? I have just read that the 5800x has a lot of heat issues so im kinda scared to get a 30$ cooler, but im on a budget and also dont really wanna spend more.",Neutral
AMD,"It would. $30 coolers can be really good these days, and while the 5800x is on the hotter side for Ryzens, it's not *that* hot. I used to run a 5800X under an Arctic 34, which was a decent but noticeably worse cooler than the A620- other than the noise, it still got the job done. Stuff like the Intel 14th gen chips could put out way more heat, to the point where you basically needed an AIO, but the A620 will cool anything with 8 cores easily.",Positive

AMD,Ah fair enough.,Positive
AMD,"Well, I think I have figured out what is going on.    I'd blame board manufacturers. So. First bus gets all the lanes. And it connects to x16 slot, x4 NVME. Second bus connects to second NVME which gets either 4x or 2x., depending on model of CPU.   Thus. If you plug in the 10 lane processor, those 10 lanes would get allocated to NVME1 with 4 lanes, NVME2 with 2 lanes and x16 slot with 4 lanes. In theory, it would have been possible to use either a switch, or just different routing and get x2 nvme + x8 on gpu slot, but... Most boards have 2 NVME slots. So that is why  8500G sort of sucks.

I guess it can be alright if you aren't really going to play any heavy games or you don't plan to add a GPU later. I personally would just get a 7600/x if like you say the games you play can be played with intel IGP. The IGPs on those are better than a UHD 630.  >What sort of GPU performance hit to expect from 4x instead of 8 lanes.  Depends on the GPU and vram. As long as it's gen4 & the vram isn't saturated the reduction in performance shouldn't be too significant.

AMD,"Yeah, I have already figured it out that 8500G is meh of a processor, which is fine if it would have been $50 cheaper. But it isn't.  What about A620 boards?

AMD,"The 9800X3D purely for gaming is slightly better unless you plan on doing creative tasks that need all those cores. The 9950's cache has a slight latency which leads to a couple % lower performance in some games.

AMD,Had the same decision. Went for the 9950X3D since i also work in Unity or other programs. Probably spending my time 60-70% gaming and the rest for work stuff. So the 9950X3D was definetly a good choice for me.,Positive
AMD,"9950X3D no question but if you don’t do anything other than gaming (including not streaming while gaming) and don’t mind super slow shaders compilation then 9800X3D. I had the 9800X3D and glad I made the upgrade. Unlike 7800X3D vs 7950X3D though, 9950X3D pulls ahead of 9800X3D in pure gaming performance albeit negligible difference and 9800X3D only winning this time in a very small number of games this time round.",Neutral

AMD,"The 9800X3D is slightly ahead on benchmarks in gaming performance, while the 9950X3D wins in productivity tasks by a few percentage points.  Honestly, you're not gonna notice a difference on a day-to-day basis, but if you plan to use your computer primarily for gaming, you'd be better off saving the 200USD and get the 9800X3D. If you use your computer for a lot of heavy, multi-core tasks, such as rendering and and encoding, then you're better off with the 9950X. The 9950X gets 50% better multi-core performance, thanks to the 8 additional cores over the 9800X3D. That of course depends on if the software you use are able to use all those 16 cores well, but yeah.",Positive
AMD,"My 9800X3D with 5090 is worse than i9-14900KF with 4090. CPU matters. I'd go with i9-14900KF if I were you. Or an equivalent.

Peerless Assasssin 120 is awesome, I had it on my 5800X 100-120W and now my 9950X 200W.  Edit: also, fine tuning some settings like PBO limits and Curve Optimizer negative values can drop temps a lot. On my 5800X with default settings I got 125W package power, 81C core temp and 14500 points in CB23. With 100W power limit and -20-25 on almost all cores in Curve Optimizer temp dropped to 77C and CB23 increased to 15100.",Positive
AMD,Yeah 90 is pretty warm. I would grab a solid two-tower air cooler. Thermalright has some good bang-for-buck coolers.,Positive
AMD,"If the CPU isn't reaching 95C, which is the max temperature for the Ryzen 7000 series chips, then while a better cooler will reduce the temperature, don't expect it to improve performance.   If your goal is just to feel better about your system because you don't like the 90C temps, by all means, you can get a better cooler. But there's nothing wrong with it as it is right now in an objective sense.   Ryzen AM5 CPUs are meant to be thermally limited. They try to keep boosting until they reach 95C by design. So your CPU is just doing exactly what AMD intends it to do.",Neutral

It is possible to play Borderlands 4 on your rig, but the performance would be abysmal. Like 30 to sub 30 fps on 720p, you’d have to use a lot of upscaling. I personally wouldn’t recommend it.",Negative
AMD,"My condolences, idk think you are gonna find one for that price, and borderlands 4, you can pretty much forget anything but the highest priced cards. Min of a 3080. And you would have to upgrade your processor as it would bottleneck card you want. Modern games just suck at optimizing.",Negative
AMD,$150 should get you an RTX 2070 or 2070 Super.,Neutral

AMD,"Intel Arc A380 is essentially your only new option. You *might* find a used 3060 or 2070 for under $150  If you save up another $100, that gets you into the range of a Arc B580 or RTX 5050, or used 3070/ 4060  BG3 is doable with any of those. With Borderlands 4 you're barely scraping above minimum requirements with RAM, CPU and GPU when the game is already poorly optimized",Neutral

AMD,"These are all pretty underwhelming in terms of being an upgrade from your current card, but as temporary replacements so you're not left without a GPU they're all perfectly viable.  If the idea is to have something to play on while you save money after your current GPU dies, go with any of them, but if you're hoping to upgrade in the process, I'd buy one of these cards, keep saving money and resell the used card when you're ready to buy something new.  Used 3080s should be around $300-350 and be a huge jump in performance. Just make sure your PSU can handle one, your current setup is pretty low wattage",Neutral

Still same issue.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, could've stated that in the title",Neutral
AMD,"Runs totally fine on my 6950XT as well without a driver upgrade, even better than how the beta ran. I saw a comment about issues after upgrading, so maybe its better to not fix what is not broken.",Positive
AMD,"Well, I had 2 crashes so far, once my 9070XT was undervolted a bit, and once with factory settings, although I suspect that the crash might have been due to my CPU being overwhelmed if there's such a thing.

AMD,ask rdr2 devs to fix that.,Negative
AMD,"I have absolutely no idea for sure but it suddenly occurred to me – would using dxvk possibly act as a workaround? Personally I don't recall having issues with vulkan when I played it through the last time, but that was a few years ago now.",Neutral
AMD,Not sure if this is your issue but when I changed 'asyncComputeEnabled' to true in the settings file (Documents\\Rockstar Games\\Red Dead Redemption 2\\Settings) it fixed the stuttering.,Neutral
AMD,Not before they don't fix the problem I have sometimes on monitor wakeup ever since like 2 drivers ago. Video freezes and I have to turn a monitor on/off.,Negative
AMD,"I don't know if its the same issue I had when I played it, but only disabling SAM fixed my crashing in Vulkan.  That was like 3 years ago, though. They won't fix shit at this point.",Negative
AMD,"I don't have any stutter on dx12 in rdr2, I'm using optiscaler for fsr4.   Granted I am limiting the frame rate with vsync but still, no stutter.",Positive
AMD,Undervolt and maybe set a negative power limit offset,Neutral
AMD,Not really. Unless there are undocumented fixes and changes.,Neutral
AMD,"There no reason to bother with this even if you play Battlefield.  This drivers are for people who know nothing about hardware and drivers, to stop complaining AMD doesn't release unnecessary game drivers.",Negative

AMD,literally the only reason i checked for new drivers today.,Neutral
AMD,Seems to have worked,Positive

AMD,I'm on the verge of buying a new system and this or the 5070ti. Hearing crap like this and the fact there was no day one driver really makes me not want to go.,Negative
AMD,Generally refers to specific optimizations,Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately it got fixed, which is a shame cause I really liked the Wendie's-drive-thru mic and it was absolutely hilarious.  Now I have to try and figure out a way to recreate it with free mic-modification software, either that or find a shitty-mic artisan to custom make me a mic that, isn't just loud and low-bit, but has that extra crispy distortion too.  Kinda wish AMD noise suppression had a toggle switch to enable crispy mic mode for fun (or even better, have it as a second output, so proximity chat in-game is crunchy but discord comms are perfect fine).",Negative
AMD,"Yeah that's the bug I'm talking about. its present since 25.9.2. Use DDU then install any older driver to fix it. AMD is bad when it comes to testing... [u/AMD\_Vik](https://www.reddit.com/user/AMD_Vik/) can you pls look into it?  I found a bug in AMD adrenaline sw so many times. One day i decided to report it but it hasn't reached anyone important so it was pointless (I tried Reddit, discord, bug report).",Negative

AMD,BF6 is the only new game listed in the changelog,Neutral
AMD,Pretty sure the driver is meant for BF6 and that's what he's referring to,Neutral
AMD,Damnit,Negative
AMD,"Yeah the game runs great even on 25.9.1 on the 6900XT. I´m running 1440p native with arround 80 or more depends on the map.  I think I will enable FSR just to make sure I have a little higher fps, for the maps that requires more ""power"".  Also I think my 5800X is maybe hitting the limits :(",Positive
AMD,What was the performance like yesterday compared to the new driver?,Neutral
AMD,"1440p with a RX 6900 XT doesn't mean much, since the RX 6700 XT that is supposed to be a 1440p card.",Neutral
AMD,Such a shame for such a masterpiece that it is,Negative
AMD,"I will try this. You using amd card with SAM enabled? dx12 with SAM enabled is stuttering hard for me but when i disabled it, it was manageable i thought.",Neutral
AMD,I tried disabling SAM and the VRAM usage still goes up and up until it crashes.,Negative
AMD,AMD card with SAM enabled yes?,Neutral
AMD,So it's not a driver issue and instead a power issue for the GPU?   It's the only game it's happened to me in. Black Ops 6 and the 7 beta.   BF6 beta was fine. Ghost of Tsushima and Rebirth have been fine.,Neutral
AMD,ROCm for Windows support theoretically. This is probably the main reason why this driver release is still preview.,Neutral
AMD,i guess its still not fixed. im using a 7700XT. man i really hoped amd would be able to provide a ''patch'' for bf6 so we can use the new drivers while also being able to play bf6. it really is only discord/steam/chrome. idk about twitch since i dont watch twitch. games are perfectly fine. just anoying/scare having it look like gpu is dying,Negative
AMD,Keep in mind that this is one report by one person. Don’t put too much weight on just this,Neutral
AMD,"To be clear the driver that came out for the beta from AMD is basically a the game-ready driver.  It's worked perfectly fine for others, and from what I've read, this new driver is similar to it.  So AMD had drivers ready before the game came out.   Also, I don;t have any of the other issues they are having, the app works perfectly fine.  Somethings up with their system.",Positive
AMD,Nvidia is a no brainer if the performance/price of the cards you're comparing is similar but that's not often the case,Neutral

AMD,If you can find an old Xbox 360 mic that will do it for you lol,Neutral
AMD,Isn't it also some hiphop dude?,Neutral
AMD,"Yup, you can only use this driver for this one game. Going forward each driver will have a single purpose. We will need a separate computer for every app now.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm on a 6800 on driver 25.8.1 (think this is what was required for the BF6 beta) and I'm hitting 80-96fps at 1080p Balanced preset with the auto config having almost everything on Ultra.  This game is crazy optimized. I got crashes in the Beta on this same driver, but so far it's been stable on the full release (proves it was a Beta issue).",Positive
AMD,"I must say that the FSR implementation is great! No fizzle, everything is clear and visible and no artifacts.",Positive
AMD,I don't use the new preview driver. Still use the one that was released for Dying Light (25.9.2).,Neutral
AMD,?,Neutral
AMD,"I have it on, yeah. I recall I was getting the stuttering with both Vulkan and DX12. I have vulkan with async compute enabled, vsync on (can't remember if that was required). Hope that helps.",Neutral
AMD,9070xt and yeah,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe tweak the graphics or so. Also set streaming to lowest values possible, sometimes that fucks that up too. VRAM usage to at 80%. But DDU and current version should be fine. Sometimes it can be a power issue, if the peak is too much. What PSU do you use?",Neutral
AMD,Getting the exact same thing you guys are talking about on my 7900XTX mainly on twitch/chrome/outlook app,Neutral
AMD,It’s literally called 25.10.1 Battlefield 6 Preview Driver,Neutral
AMD,come on bro you know what he meant,Neutral
AMD,"Your only issue that one time with Vulkan is only stuttering and not memory leak right? My vram usage keeps going up and up, does not reset until it crashes ""Unknown error: fffff""",Negative
AMD,"I have an RMx1000  I've tried at graphic levels in the game, too. Balanced, Ultra, and Extreme. Seems to happen randomly on all those settings. I never tweak Adrenalin settings for any game.   I used the game telemetry to check GPU temps and VRAM usage and highest VRAM I've seen is 60% and that was on Extreme at about 100fps. GPU hot spot peaks at about 80C but mostly stays in 50s and 60s",Neutral
AMD,"People have a habit of complaining that certain games aren't supported in certain drivers and it's a ridiculous notion. People misunderstand how the system works. When you get a game ready driver it doesn't mean they've made the game work with an amd graphics card and previous drivers didn't work, yet that seems to be some people's interpretation. The game must provide the support if any vendor specific tech is used, not the other way round.",Negative
AMD,Just try and play around a bit in adrenaline. My 68xt and 9070xt run fine in bo6. Crashing only occurred with too much undervolt,Neutral
AMD,"Yep, ""we added support for BF6"" means ""we added a default profile/settings for it"", not that they made it work where it wouldn't before.",Neutral

AMD,The Sipeed NanoKVM surprised me by having a RISC-V cpu in it.  It certainly keeps the price down for home lab people like me.  ~$30-40 for the bare bones IP KVM kit seems a steal if you don't need all the bells and whistles.,Positive
AMD,"Apple proved that ARM can be phenomenally performative. When the M1 first came out, it was the most powerful single core CPU beating both Intel and AMD.   I’m still using my M1 MacBook and it’s never even hiccuped. The performance leap by that ARM processor was something that you could _feel_. There are very few technological leaps that provide such a boost to performance that you don’t need a benchmark to see.

Most of the questions were practical ones about the day to day concerns of Radeon users, what kinds of useful features we might be able to expect and when. Fabio really pushed the Optiscaler method of injection and asked why AMD can't do the same thing with FSR 2 inputs. No surprise they'll only commit to 3.1 and up, but I'm glad someone is advocating for consumer concerns. It'd be incredible if we can do it at the driver level.",Positive
AMD,Does anyone have a TLDW?,Neutral
AMD,"I think he is still underrated compared to some others that has way more subscribers.  I thought the interview questions were ok. I'm not sure if I liked some of the answers though. The fact that optiscaler was mentioned a few times made me think someone from AMD has been working with optiscaler team.   I also feel like they leaked the fsr4 INT8 version on purpose knowing the optiscaler team would snap it up and normalize it. I don't believe AMD will do any major work on the fsr4 INT8 version. What we see now is pretty much the best that  rdna 3 /2 can hope for, whilst FSR 4 FP8 will continue to evolve. Looking forward to seeing new improvements on fsr4 FP8 version in coming months.   I'm also very interested to see what afmf3 performs like. It will gain access to game information via fsr4, which will be the first. Also, the new machine learning FG will be available via driver toggle. It's a shame that Ray regeneration will need developers implementation.   It would have been good if Fabio stressed the fact that fsr 4 quality mode is bugged in some titles like wuchang and now Wukong. I know AMD already know about this bug, but more information should have been shared. Balance mode looks the same to me without the bug, so it's not a big issue right now.",Neutral

AMD,"Adam Kozak says what he has to - most of it is marketing talk. However, Chris Hall, Senior Director of Software Development at AMD (a big name), recently said in an interview that FSR Redstone will work on the principle of ML2CODE and won’t require AI-specific hardware features on the GPU. So, AMD has more or less confirmed that RDNA 2 and 3 will get improved upscaling, frame generation, and maybe even more. It’s likely to run on INT8, similar to XeSS and XeFG using DP4a. Reportedly, it will also work on NVIDIA and Intel GPUs.",Neutral

AMD,You should see his Discord if you want to see toxic community,Negative
AMD,"Yes, I believe the ""improved upscaling"" is the  FSR4 INT8 version we see now is what rdna2/3 will get, which is ultimately still superior to fsr3 which rdna2/3 currently has officially. The FP8 version will continue to evolve and will only be at its best on rdna4 cards, which was pretty much confirmed in this interview. Rdna3/2 won't get future iterations. The more FSR4 evolves the more AI power is needed, and that will be too much for rdna3 cards and certainly rdna2.   >FSR Redstone will work on the principle of ML2CODE and won’t require AI-specific hardware features on the GPU.  ""Won't require"" means it will be able to run on non ai-specific hardware, but it doesn't mean it cannot or won't take advantage of AMDs signed ai-specific hardware. I believe the best version of the FSR redstone package will be via rdna4 GPUs.   To be honest Adam Kozal wasn't really showing much enthusiasm when talking about FSR4 coming to rdna3/2. He did more optiscaler marketing than anything regarding rdna3/2 getting official FSR4 support. His marketing was pretty much "" just use optiscaler"" to rdna2/3 users.   I could be wrong but rdna3/2 won't be getting any major changes to FSR4 INT8 version, and I don't think it matters that much because in it's current state it is still superior to anything available to those GPUs. AMD might just re-release and market the leaked fsr4 INT8 version as the official version for rDNA 3/2, And continue to work on the FP8 version.",Neutral

The products we buy are the best products that can be produced at scale for the cheapest costs and widest margins.  It's a very subtle difference that results in huge implications.  A $1 difference in manufacturing costs might seem insignificant, but if you sell 250 million units - that's a quarter billion dollars profit you just left on the table. The margins can be the difference between having an economically profitable business, versus losing money and going bankrupt.  When you buy a motherboard (or anything), you can bet it is filled with dozens and dozens of '$1 decisions'. But - they still have to make competitive decisions to offer quality above their competitors.  Someone could build the best, most advanced, most durable, most performative, prettiest, highest feature set super-NASA high tech motherboard to ever exist - with every last component of thousands being the best produced in the world - It would cost $20k, would be bespoke custom built and impossible to scale, and no buyers in the market to make it feasible to sell.  If your boards have a 1GB bios chip thats 99.9% unused space that costs you $1, then your competitors will sell a board with a $0.01c 32mb bios chip, sell their boards at a lower price than yours, and run you out of business.

EVEN if amd were to reintroduce CCX's, 2x 8 core CCX on a single CCD wouldn't be entirely impossible, which ""should"" help considerably curb the issue with individual 8 core CCD, but obviously nowhere near as good as a single 12 or 16 core CCD would be.",Neutral
AMD,"> That would be a pretty major redesign for a same platform release no?  AM4 went from 8c monolithic to 16c with three chiplets in one gen, same socket.  N2 is way denser and more efficient than the N5 class process they're using right now, so a 12c zen6 CCD won't be substantially larger than an 8c zen5 CCD.

AMD,A company that would be giving up a quarter of a billion profit on a $1 saving is going to be operating on such an enormous scale that half a billion would be a drop in the bucket compared to their overall profit. Which would make it not always worth it to sacrifice the long term brand value over the short term gain.   Profits aren't looked at in absolute terms like you just described. ROI is what matters.  Apple doesn't cut $1 corners on the iPhone because that saving won't cause any material difference to the value that shareholders get from the company. But a reputation of making quality products in the long term is much more valuable and is exactly what has made Apple what it is.,Neutral
AMD,I am saying that if every product was based on that principle then we wouldn't get any quality products. Quality requires attention to detail which requires not chasing pennies.   My motherboard has 4 M.2 slots and all of them have a heatsink. Surely they could have left 1 or 2 slots alone to save more than just pennies? Most people aren't going to use 4 slots anyways.   The rear IO package on this board is so overkill that I could never populate it fully.   So on a board like this they decided to save pennies on the BIOS size? Most likely what happened is that the decision making regarding this was negligent and poorly thought through. It's now creating a problem that should have been completely unnecessary relative to the price of this board.,Negative
AMD,"This assumes, and reasonably so, that amd isn't going to at any point possibly split or create at some point, a desktop chiplet separate from the server chiplets... with some probable overlap.  What's stopping amd from cranking mostly full core chiplets, and then having a few with mixed cores. I'd say AMD's sitting on pretty solid ground to possibly do it since they've already ventured into making different chiplets already even at low volumes.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, if there were sufficient market pressure to do so (which there isn't) an AM4 Zen5 plumbed into DDR4 is entirely possible with mostly parts that have already been engineered. the IF and DDR4 would hold it back though, and I think also the sustainable socket power could be an issue (AM5 TDP's are a non-trivial increase over AM4s)  I _would_ like to see a bigZen.LittleZen setup, 12 Zen6 X3D cores and however many Zen6c cores (24?) in a single socket would be pretty sweet. and again, an 8 Zen5/X3D + 16 Zen5c part could be done _from dies they already make_, just need a new PCB underneath and I have questions about whether the Zen5c chiplet would fit in the space available in the AM5 package... but they already make the difficult parts.  (So basically I agree!)",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, DDR5's \*very\* early timeline would have been earlier, sure.  But we're not far out from DDR6 right now.  No reason to expect any notable delays.  Memory standards in general seem to have generally come along a lot more smoothly since DDR3/DDR4.  And DDR5 only first started on production lines in late 2020.  Real availability didn't come til 2021, and consumer kits were already leaking out by Q3, along with Alder Lake releasing very soon after.  AM5 was just one year late.  Here we're talking potentially being two years or more late to DDR6.  It's not impossible, I'd just be extremely surprised.  It'd be different if AMD were doing yearly releases, but with a two year gap between architectures, I think it makes it quite hard for them to justify holding out.",Neutral
AMD,"Apple was the first to start the trend of cutting accessories in their packaging, are you serious?",Negative
AMD,"I don’t want to argue since you’re just arguing against math, but yes, that is how it works. Perhaps they get a better deal on the heat sinks than the BIOS chips. My first board definitely didn’t have heat sinks for all of the NVMe drives. But I promise you, someone does the math to maximize their (company’s) earning potential.",Neutral
AMD,"You do understand its ALWAYS a balance between quality/cost, they have a bar for quality and then they do every thing they possibly can to squeak past that line with minimum cost. They also do everything they can to figure out whats ""good enough"" meaning the consumer wont notice and they can skimp on.  Thats pretty much all companies.",Neutral
AMD,"I think the real question here is what are AMD going to do with regards to the interconnect between dies; as that really informs what they are capable of doing. In any case, the IOD is going to need a major upgrade in capability (i.e. CUDIMM) at a minimum if they want to feed higher core counts on AM5.  Edit: It should probably also be noted that the cores in a CCD use a ring bus, so introducing more cores may not be desirable in the first place.",Neutral
AMD,Zen6(x) CCDs are 12 Cores.  Zen6c CCDs are 32 Cores.   They already had tapeout   I dont know if a 32c Zen6c CCD is small enough to fit together with the 12c Zen6x CCD under AM5 IHS  A zen4c die with 16cores was only 10% larger than a 8core Zen4x die  https://www.techpowerup.com/309741/amd-epyc-bergamo-uses-16-core-zen-4c-ccds-barely-10-larger-than-regular-zen-4-ccds  My dream would be also be a 12C+32c (+2 low power cores in the IO DIE) configuration.,Neutral
AMD,That's far more than a $1 saving to not include a charger in the box. More importantly it does not lower the quality of the actual product in any way.,Neutral
AMD,That's not it works for upper tier quality products. You make a quality product with no stupid compromises and then charge the max you can get from it. You are saying as if the final price is some hard limit and the profit margin is entirely dependent on the cost.,Negative
AMD,"> In any case, the IOD is going to need a major upgrade in capability (i.e. CUDIMM) at a minimum if they want to feed higher core counts on AM5.  The IOD right now can only move 50% of the peak bandwidth of regular DDR5, let alone CUDIMM (that means that they can increase BW by up to +100% without CUDIMM).  CUDIMM just pushes the gains even higher, and realises more of them without overclocks being used.  > Edit: It should probably also be noted that the cores in a CCD use a ring bus, so introducing more cores may not be desirable in the first place.  It's not exactly a ring bus. It has shortcuts across it which reduce latency and make scaling to higher core counts reasonable, like a ladder/mesh.  I believe that the returns from having more cores closer together (~1/5'th the latency, 10x BW to each other) and sharing the same pool of cache - especially with 48-144 MB of cache - greatly outweighs the downside of a somewhat increased bus latency within the CCX. Especially so if by bringing more cores onto the CCX you're bringing more cache with them (which seems to be the case here; +50% more cores = +50% more cache per CCX).",Neutral

AMD,">*for upper tier quality products*  AM5 isn't *just* upper tier quality motherboards though. Sure, your motherboard has 4 M.2 heatsinks. Cool, but not all motherboards do. Motherboard manufacturers aren't going to get an unnecessarily large 1GB BIOs chip that will have wasted space when they could save a few dollars, which, after a few ten thousand sales, will have cost them more than just a few dollars - which was Techma's point of ""pennies add up"" - sure, high-end boards with high-end markups can afford to add fancy features to make the product worth the cost, but that doesn't apply to all of the AM5 motherboards. Premium products have premium markups to justify the costs, and in that scenario, the company will have no problem making a premium board at a premium price that makes them money. A company spending a few extra dollars on an unnecessary 1GB BIOs chip that'll end up being wasted space that requires more power to use for a board that they already may only have $20-$40 margins on is a pretty unnecessary cost that, if a company chooses to do, will inevitably end up resulting in that extra cost reflecting on the price of the motherboard to consumers, and people complain about modern motherboard prices being high as it is.",Neutral
AMD,">The IOD right now can only move 50% of the peak bandwidth of regular DDR5, let alone CUDIMM (that means that they can increase BW by up to +100% without CUDIMM).  Even with CUDIMM the peak theoretical bandwidth of 128-bit DDR5 is insufficient to feed AVX-512 workloads on Zen 5. So it's moot either way without a solution to both bottlenecks. Whatever the solution, I don't think it's going to be fanout like some have been speculating.  >It's not exactly a ring bus. It has shortcuts across it which reduce latency and make scaling to higher core counts reasonable, like a ladder/mesh.  Unless they changed it in Zen 4 or 5, since the unified 8-core CCD in Zen 3 it's been a bi-directional ring bug, at least according to AMD's own slides.  >I believe that the returns from having more cores closer together (~1/5'th the latency, 10x BW to each other) and sharing the same pool of cache - especially with 48-144 MB of cache - greatly outweighs the downside of a somewhat increased bus latency within the CCX.

Whatever the solution, I don't think it's going to be fanout like some have been speculating.  I'm sure, but having 128 bit of throughput instead of 64 in the IOD will surely go a long way towards helping it. Our DDR5-8400 is currently running with no more bandwidth than an i7 8700k's dual channel DDR4 from 2017, both systems being overclocked, because the IOD can only read 50% of the data that the memory bus can transfer.  Vast majority of workloads become bound by cores or by memory latency before saturating 140GB/s read. It's not really efficient to budget bandwidth for the peak workload when almost everything consumes much less. We can surely get a lot closer though, the current bottleneck is pretty ridiculous (~64GB/s read and write).  Threadripper saw good benefits going to 64c on 4-channel DDR5, which is equivelant to 16c+16c on 2-channel DDR5 - and they had a worse (early gen) memory controller plus no CUDIMM support. Throwing more cores does help a lot of problems even if there isn't a proportional increase in memory bandwidth. Consolidating CCX's into fewer, larger blocks helps a great deal too with some classes of workloads.  > Unless they changed it in Zen 4 or 5, since the unified 8-core CCD in Zen 3 it's been a bi-directional ring bug, at least according to AMD's own slides.  They have been working on it a bit yeah. Adding shortcuts  > I'd imagine it'd have wins in some scenarios and losses in others.  I'm fairly sure it's an improvement overall, and that a large reason we don't have it now is because of chiplet size (a larger CCD wouldn't fit as many chiplets on X package size). Dropping two process nodes, it's now practical to do a 12c 48MB CCD in the size of the old 8c 32MB.  More cores/cache within a CCX offers a massively disproportionate improvement for game performance so it'd be a big hit on desktop DIY.",Neutral

There is no reason not to buy a 4tb pcie 5.0 ssd and just use that with a single m.2 slot, maybe a 2nd one if u need to tho usually the 2nd one doesnt support pcie 5.0 anymore since the gpu and usb 4 port also need pcie 5.0, so any ssd after ur 1st one is not gonna be at pcie 5.0 speed anyway meaning u're handicapping urself by not using ur primary 4 tb ssd. If a mb supports pcie 5.0 speed on the 2nd m.2 slot it will come from the usb4 port's bandwidth, and the few that support 5.0 on the 3rd slot come from the gpu's bandwidth using bifurcating. So it's all the same u're just shuffling the bandwidth around, nothing changes whether it has ""5"" or 500000 slots.",Neutral

AMD,"if you think you're 100% correct - go out and buy an x3d and run the tests, post a video with the results, and put an amazon affiliate link in the comments for a 14700k build that overall is better than an x3d.  there's nothing wrong with the 14700k, it's a beast. i think there's a few select games where it even beats the 7800x3d. but there's a reason that you can find hundreds of youtube channels with sub counts up and down the spectrum from 0 subs to 10M subs showing hardware side by sides with the x3d's beating the 14700k - and most of them don't have advertisers to please.  in my opinion, you're getting downvoted because you don't want to provide proof, you're out here saying it's tech tubers fault that you have no proof. you can also find a good amount of open source benchmark data at openbenchmarking.org, it's not pretty - but there's useful data there as well.  but hey - you're only hurting yourself by not breaking open the youtube techfluencer conspiracy around AMD processors. go buy an x3d, do all the testing, and use it as a springboard to free us from the lies of big tech. i'd love for you to be correct, but until you can provide proof, it honestly just looks like you have buyers remorse with your 14700k.",Neutral
AMD,">asking others what scores they’re getting in games. Or If you can afford it, CPUs like 7700X, 14600K, or 14700K aren’t that expensive you can buy them and test for yourself. Just a few games are enough to show RPL processors are far ahead of Zen 4/5 non 3ds CPUs in gaming.  [but it's not true?](https://youtu.be/IeBruhhigPI?t=13m3s) 1%low on 9700X is identical to 14700k/14900k, and better than on 14600k, AVG. FPS is slightly higher on 14700k/14900k, or is 9.7% higher average FPS on 14900k considered ""far ahead""? Plus, 14900K is not a CPU for gaming, it's a CPU for production workloads plus gaming, which makes it noticeably more expensive than 9700X, so realistically we should compare 9700X to 14600K/14700K.",Neutral
AMD,"Cherry picked results or just outright fake.  A 14700k isn't 30-40% faster compared to zen 4/5 non-3d chips.  Come up with a decent game sample first first before coming up with stupid conclusions.  Every reviewer I've found just happens to have different results than yours so everyone must be wrong except ""me"" right?  Even if the 14700k is slightly faster it still consumes a lot more power so theres that.  The numbers you can find from reviewers point to the 9700x being around 5 % slower, and you here are talking about 30-40% lul, if it was 30-40% faster it would be faster than a fking 9800x3d lmao.",Negative

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU.

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral
AMD,An Intel + nVidia handheld would be something I would welcome just for DLSS4 alone.,Positive
AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it. This will ""hurt"" AMD by offering competition to markets where AMD currently holds a monopoly like with Strix Halo, most handhelds and consoles.  I don’t think we’ll see big changes on the Intel side.  I don’t think this will affect neither the iGPUs nor ARC because why would it.",Negative

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Negative
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral

AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Positive
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral

AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer.

AMD,Never said that.,Neutral
AMD,Also a way for Nvidia to invest some of their funny money (which is essentially infinite) into a cheap company. Intel under $20 was ludicrous. Intel is still at book value at $29.,Neutral

AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits. But they have raised those limits, and the open NVIDIA drivers are getting better in time.",Positive
AMD,"Yup. Their nForce boards were great for overclocking, but rather buggy too.",Negative

AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.   I on the other hand don't get why would Intel forfeit it's competitive advantage with GPU accelerated AI, XeSS or QuickSync and made itself dependant on nVidia. Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company. Like this deal is not exactly what killed arc, but arc was already struggling beforehand so this was most likely the nail in the coffin.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia does not have an A310 competitor.,Neutral

AMD,I have not lied,Neutral
AMD,"While workstations dont directly contribute a big chunk of the sales, I suspect they dont want to yield their foothold on the ML/Data Science guys.  If they start getting familiar with non-nVIDIA ecosystems, it could mean indirect losses when these guys start procuring non-nVIDIA dGPUs in servers when they do port their workstation experiments to ""larger"" hardware now that AI is all the rage.  B60 is gaining momentum on homelabs, and Strix Halo to some extent getting popular for those needing more memory for their larger datasets.",Neutral
AMD,"MLID has used clickbait trash thumbnails/titles way too many times, no one should watch that garbage channel to begin with.",Negative
AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus. Like a b580 destroys the 5060 and 5050 while costing less or the same amount. There's no way nvidia invests 5 billion without some agreement that kills off arc as long as they are together.,Negative
AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Positive
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Negative
AMD,"You did tho. It doesn't look like ""later versions of DLSS 2"". Every reputable source has said it's better than DLSS 3 and close to DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Neutral

AMD,Nvidia probably feels the same about their low end SKUs.,Neutral

Surface is notorious for being 3 or so quarters after CPU launch.  Look at where MTL is on this schedule, for example. Also around Q2, even though it had been on store shelves technically since the previous year's Q4.

AMD,"My god.  The only reason huge caches benefit gaming, is to benefit rushes to shipment by the publisher, so that game engineers either don't have to optimize, or they can use garbage like Unity, or both.

Also... diminishing returns, and I doubt AMD will put this in Zen 5 -- seems like a trash rumor, to me.",Negative
AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

AMD,Yea but I’m not paying for e cores that are barely faster than my current skylake cores. I just want p cores only.,Negative
AMD,"IPC is just 1 factor  Zen 4 clocks much higher, and got a far superior low latency caching subsystem   No one sane thinks that Skymont can actually beat Zen 4 in most workloads Only if you downclock Zen 4... and guve it slow ram to increase latency",Neutral

Since assets are first stored in memory, then fed to cache, any bottleneck between Cache - to memory will cause delays when loading asset thus 1% FPS... measured temporally(in this case).",Neutral
AMD,The bad optimisation critics aremostly people trying to sound smart by rambling things they dont understand.  Game engines are very optimized these days.   Its funny they mostly pick on Unreal Engine 5 as the prime example... That is probably the most complete game engine out there. So naturally its hard to make all that stuff work well togetter... They have litterally some of the best coders and researchers in the business ... Id love to see you do a better job.,Negative
AMD,Mixed cores are awesome if the scheduler would do what i want and there lies the problem and i dont think even AI can solve that yet.,Negative
AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative
AMD,"I play Warthunder almost daily. It’s ridiculously fucking optimized.   I got cyberpunk when it came out, it was a shit show. Elden ring? Mediocre.  Escape from tarkov? Fucking laughable.  Call of duty? 500 terabytes. Besides this small list,  I’ll wait for battlefield 6 (which by the way also has a history of releasing unoptimized)  The one thing I will say is that developers do work hard after releases to optimize their games. I’m just so use to playing Warthunder which almost always works, everyday, perfectly, with no complaints. lol",Negative
AMD,"Do tell how a bigger cache makes games faster, if you are aware of some details.  And, of course, how doubling the already tripled cache will yield perf improvements worth the huge amount of extra money to make such chips.",Neutral

AMD,It's not sorcery. Its just Intel doing the game developers work.,Neutral
AMD,"Is it updated? Last time I tried it, it didn't have an uninstaller and not many games were supported. In the ones I tried, there was no difference at all.",Negative
AMD,"It's very specific scenarios where this can unlock new performance, most games it won't do anything or even lower performance.     So they can't *really expand it* since it's an uncommon scenario. That's why we have so few games that benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,Never count out Intel. They have some very talented people over there.,Positive
AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.     This sucks because I own BG3, which is one of the new titles they added recently along with Cyberpunk 2077.",Negative
AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.       The DTT driver should be downloadable from Intel, and not from the motherboard manufacturers who cannot be trusted to make the latest version available.",Negative
AMD,The intel software team is pure black magic when they allowed to work on crack.,Negative
AMD,"Here is a screenshot showing CPU activity across all cores.  This is with HT disabled BTW, and the cooler is an Id FROZN A720.

AMD,"When combined with Nova Lake's bLLC, it could give Intel a major edge over AMD's X3D.       And yeah, limiting it to certain games and certain CPUs is a real downer for the technology, so hopefully Intel can find a way to streamline and expand it when Nova Lake launches.",Positive
AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral
AMD,Or... Just process lasso.,Neutral
AMD,Because it’s optimizations on how it can efficiently use the cpu.,Neutral
AMD,Must the App be downloaded? Or it's automatic after installing the PPM and DTT drivers?,Neutral
AMD,"All of this stuff is super situational. For when it’s supported for my 14th G, I love it.  To call it better than X3D though? That’s a bit much.",Positive
AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's a pretty cool, yet simple idea. It would be really nice to give users more granular control natively.",Positive
AMD,Are the e cores clustered in order so we would be able to manually achieve this with process lasso?,Neutral
AMD,Why should game devs be automatically expected to specifically optimize their game for specific architectures of Intel's CPUs? It's not on them to do so.,Negative
AMD,You need to download the Intel Application Optimization app from the Windows store,Neutral
AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there.

AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.

AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative

AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.

AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU.

AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral

This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.

AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral

AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Positive
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral

AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral

AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral

Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability.

Not to mention they did shady business like keep doing rebranding old chip as the new series to fools people into thinking it was new architecture when it wasn't and sell it with higher price compared to chip on the same architecture in old gen.  Intel surely needed to kick Amd ass because Amd keep milking people with the same 6 and 8 cores CPU over and over with price increases too!

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.

AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral

AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral

AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.

Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral

AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).

I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I somewhat agree with this. I suppose it depends if Intel’s latency problem with their P+E core design is at all a fixable one - 4c/8t is still shockingly serviceable for gaming, but 4c/4t absolutely is not.",Neutral

AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience. I'm speaking from experience since I also have a fully tuned 9950x3D/5090 on my testbench. For productivity task Intel feels much better to use as well. I feel like Intel is just better optimized for Windows and Productivity too.",Positive

Desktop side, AMD 7000 is a hot mess, like seriously ridiculous. Seems that was sorted on 9000,    Let's wait and see on nova lake and zen6, like I said, brand loyalty is stupid, bought into AM5, so it's cheaper for me to go for zen6 with 244Mb of L3, but no am6-7 that will be intel.",Negative

Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).

AMD,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Negative

AMD,"Thank you. I spent some more time looking and it appears VROC on x299 was discontinued sometime in the past two years? Seems intel pushed people towards RST. I guess the question still stands since VROC on X299 has moved into sustaining mode, so drives that maybe came out during that time should still work.

AMD,"I'm mostly referring to the fact they've designed the matrix to be printed near invisibly with it being absolutely miniscule and basically the same colour as the pcb, then made it a mandatory requirement for the RMA process.

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.     [Information about Temperature for Intel® Processors](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005597/processors.html)  [How to Know the Idle Temperature of Intel® Processor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090343/processors.html)  [What Is Throttling and How Can It Be Resolved?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000088048/processors.html)  For overclocking: Note that the motherboard does have an impact on the ability to overclock. Some are better quality and more capable than others. Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.   Since you've already tried the obvious stuff like BIOS reset and driver rollbacks, you're probably looking at a Windows service or background process gone rogue. Keep me posted on what you find with that CPU usage spike and reliability monitor - those are likely our smoking guns!",Neutral
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're absolutely correct about VROC on X299 being discontinued. Intel moved VROC for X299 platforms into sustaining mode within the past two years and has shifted focus toward Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) for consumer applications. While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly. However, newer drives may work but won't receive official validation or certification. For anyone building new systems, Intel recommends using RST instead of VROC, but existing X299 users can continue using VROC with supported drives from the qualified vendor list. ***Support is now limited to sustaining mode with no new features or drive certifications planned, as confirmed in the support article you referenced.***",Neutral

AMD,"u/Maleficent_Apple4169 NVMe drivers are typically **chipset/motherboard-based**, not SSD-specific. The driver you need depends on your motherboard's chipset, not the SSD brand.

Motherboard Manufacturer Support:  Visit your motherboard brand's website (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.)  Download chipset/storage drivers for your specific board model    Most likely solution, download Intel RST drivers or AMD chipset drivers based on your motherboard's chipset  this will provide the NVMe controller drivers needed for Windows installation.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes, I've turned off the system animations, and the blinking cursors.  There aren't settings to switch fonts, to replace thin/faint fonts with bold ones. The folks developing Windows like Segoe Ui, maybe they can read it. There are regedit hacks, but I'm not sure how to do them. There is also Winaero Tweaker, which can switch some fonts, but doesn't work on some older apps with unreadable text. There is MacType, which can bolden text without switching fonts, but doesn't work everywhere either.  There are settings to scale fonts, or scale everything, or reduce resolution. I've tried every combination of these. I've reduced resolution, since it does work everywhere. But I can't go below 1280x720, and I end up breaking some interfaces anyway. There is also the magnifier, but it gives me a migraine.  Here's the thing. If text is too thin/faint, making it 2x as bold will take less than 2x the screen space; making it 2x as big will take 4x the screen space.  I'm surprised how well tweaking gamma has worked. So far it has worked everywhere with dark text on light images, and it's worked very well.",Negative

AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Neutral
