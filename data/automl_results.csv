Intel,"5050 really has no right to exist at the price it does.

Intel,I'd still probably go nvidia here as I don't trust intel's compatibility with older titles and the like.   Still it would probably be better to spend $20 more on a 9060 xt 8 gb or $50 more on a 5060 than either of these.,Neutral

Intel,Tech is supposed to beat inflation. Look at monitors or TVs or SSDs (before now) or CPUs or ....,Neutral
Intel,"First of all 250 euros bought way more gpu in 2015 than 360 does today. And the lower end and midrange gpus were much less cut down vs the high end chipa today.  A 5050 sits where the 750ti did when the 980ti was out. Now you get entry level performance for mid end prices  Have wages actually increased that much? Because that is the only useful measure of ""inflation"". Everything else is just corporate profits   If prices for everything go up but wages don't then that leaves less money for frivolous shit like ram and storage and laptops and consoles, not more.  Even in my country where our wages are automatically indexed to match inflation, our purchasing power has dropped because the actual cost of living isn't properly represented in whichever calculation is used for the inflation number.  Houses have gone up by 100+ percent since 2015, rents have gone up by over 60 percent, grocery prices have more than doubled, utility prices have risen sharply, public transport has more than tripled in cost.  Minor expenses like clothing or a tv you buy every ten years have stayed flat, but that isnt what people are spending 80 percent of their income on.",Neutral

Intel,You're getting downvoted for speaking the truth.  The RTX 5050 should be a $150-180 GPU for the price and value it offers but unfortunately people are gonna defend the price tag that the card was set for by Nvidia,Negative
Intel,"For a while you could get them for $229, which would be more acceptable vs a 5060 for $299, making it the same FPS/$. But the 5060 is actually the one on sale right now for only $30-$35 more. 30% faster for like 12% more money.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel checks all the right boxes on paper (generous VRAM, decent pricing compared to competitors, an alternative to the duopoly) but the recent CPU overhead stuff coupled with the crapshoot that is trying to play older games and it just isn't worth it",Neutral

Intel,TSMC inflation is FAR higher than CPI. You are half right,Neutral
Intel,I doubt ppl are gonna defend the 5050 considering a 5060 or an 8GB 9060XT is not much more and a fair bit faster.,Negative
Intel,I pretty much but there's nothing else people *trust* in the category because apparently Arc cards are for professional nerds or something whereas I haven't had a real bad driver issue in over 2 years with my A770  People are also conditioned to fear older gen GPUs so 6xxx and 7xxx parts are sitting on shelves waiting for blowout discounts. People would still rather spend more on a basic nvidia from the 5000 series.,Negative
Intel,B580 user here. I coupled it with a R5 5500 and as of the recent updates the card just seemed to run much better vs when I got it last July.  There was a video before which also revealed that the CPU overhead is now being addressed in subsequent updates.  https://youtu.be/gfqGqj2bFj8?si=PyAfB2NhqZKWWVXY  I’d say it’s getting better and that I’d recommend it over a 5050 since the overhead is now fixed/negligible.,Positive
Intel,\>dlss quality preset uses higher resolution than XeSS and FSR quality presets  Not exactly. FSR and DLSS are evenly matched in internals at all quality presets.,Neutral
Intel,"Not if you consider how the workloads being run on them have also changed. A GTX 970 ($450 inflation adjusted) would have run 2015 games better than how a RTX 5060 Ti ($429) or 5070 ($550) run 2025 games.  In other words, demand for performance has outstripped performance improvements, and those improvements are not felt as much.",Neutral
Intel,"A 100$ CPU in 2015 would easily run 2015 made software. A 100$ CPU in 2025 would barely run the electron JS slop. This includes Windows.

Yes yes yes it is very good on benchmarks but I don't stare at benchmarks all day. I use my computer for things you do at computer. Don't force my CPU to crunch how much digits of Pi it can compute.  A 980 Ti can easily run top 2015 games. Now? My laptop barely runs modern AAA games without looking a blurry mess.

Intel,"> would have run 2015 games better than how a RTX 5060 Ti ($429) or 5070 ($550) run 2025 games.  I think your memory is impacted by the expectations at the time.

The [970](https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060/images/witcher3_1920_1080.png) couldn't even get 60 fps in witcher 3. Which was released in 2015.  And the performance it got in Witcher 3.

Is one of the hardest/heaviest titles with the worst performance. You can expect much better performance in almost every title. Just like the 970 was doing better than it did in Witchers 3.   But to argue that we got a lot better performance back then in the games releasing at the time, that is just false.",Negative
Intel,"All the GPU makers are betting on you using DLSS/FSR/XeSS as part of your usage to play games. Maybe even frame generation along with Relex, and all the other tech they ship GPUs with. They used to only rely on you using regular AA techniques.   If you ignore all those options you have today, and pay like it's 2015, it might be worse a lot of the time. If you use those options, you're generally way ahead of where a GTX 970 would fall. So it depends if you're willing to adopt new rendering tech, or rejecting it.",Neutral

Intel,"Bringing up 1080p no RT Wukong benchmarks sort of makes the point for me: the only way these cards look comparable is if we pretend features and standards are the exact same they were a decade ago.  High res and high refresh monitors were a luxury in 2015, now they are a dime a dozen. RT was not a thing in 2015, now it is and Nvidia marketing really wants you to use it. It's like you're comparing Witcher 3 on Ultra settings to Wukong on Medium or High settings, and acting like it's apples to apples.  The moment you take modern displays and features (including DLSS to be fair) into account, it paints a picture where technology has moved on, developers and players would love to move on, and GPUs are struggling to make that jump.",Neutral
Intel,"I've got nothing against DLSS, I use it whenever I can, but sometimes it's just not enough to bridge that gap.  Another user brought up Witcher 3 and Wukong as an example of a graphically advanced 2015 game vs a graphically advanced 2025 game. The 970 would get 50+ fps on Ultra settings Witcher 3.

Intel,">  and acting like it's apples to apples.  Apples to apples would be comparing W3 performance for both cards.  Wukong even without RT is a CONSIDERABLY more advanced game graphically than original W3.   >High res and high refresh monitors were a luxury in 2015, now they are a dime a dozen.   And? Better monitors showing up doesn't change the laws of physics and basic economics. It doesn't make scaling with die shrinks suddenly increase. With your logic the 970 was a terrible deal vs some early/mid 2000s GPUs that delivered better FSP at 1024x800 in games released at the time.   And before you start harping on about die sizes. The die in the 5060 Ti is actually more expensive than the die used on the 970. Wafer price increases more than compensates for the size difference.",Neutral
Intel,"Looked it up. Wither 3 got 52 FPS at Ultra settings, no Nvidia Hairworks turned on, for a GTX 970. Wukong gets 42 FPS at the cinematic preset native resolution, which is actually intended for cinematics, but developers allow people to enable anyways. As Digital Foundry has said, they maybe shouldn't.  Gets over 70 FPS if you turn the preset down 1 notch to high. No upscaling, or frame generation, or hardware RT, which is like what Nvidia Hairworks was for Witcher 3. It's really not hard to get Wukong to run at 90 FPS on a 5060ti with some minor tweaks.",Neutral

Intel,"It'll happen eventually but they have a few issues.  First is memory bandwidth, they'd need to put a wider bus on it to address which is costly.  Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.  A think that in 2028 big APU solutions can compete well against XX50 series and most XX60 cards.  It isn't happening before then however.",Negative

Intel,this GPU is also coming into the 355H btw (more specifically there's a Ultra X7 version of the 355H with the full 12-core GPU)     and iirc last time the 255H was pretty popular,Neutral
Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Ofcourse it’s paired with 14900k so my igpu technically has identical specs but I keep temps down this way. Also have an RTX 50 series. I love arc graphics. Bang for buck AT HIGHER RESOLUTIONS — that’s where it’s at. And I’ve had 4090 (sold), amd 9070(sold). Never would I pay what they are asking for a 5090.

Intel,IMO it's probably not economical for them to do it.   Gaming laptops/handhelds are already niche enough as it is -- doesn't make sense for them to package both and for OEMs to carry both for just for a ~$1-200 delta between the units. Those who want the full GPU will just pay for it.,Negative
Intel,"You gotta remember these CPU’s don’t have multi-threading. AMD gets 16 threads out of their 8 core z1 and z2 extreme but with these core ultra’s you get one core and that’s it. A full on physical core is better than a virtual core, but the same amount of cores with multi-threading is much better than just a same core-count CPU without it. Intel are offering up to 16 cores which is 16 cores/16 threads, but generally should offer better multi-core performance vs an 8-core 16-thread. If anything it’s nice Intel have the ability to improve core count offerings without significantly raising the power requirements.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Neutral
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.

Intel,"Yeah after being reminded that the LPE cores are also Darkmont like the E-Cores I looked up the layout in detail and the differences is simply the P and E cores are on a large Cluster with L3 Cache and a fast ring-bus, but the LPE cores are seperated from that Ring-bus and don't have any L3 Cache (just access to a ""memory side-cache"" accessible by the NPU and small cluster but not the large cluster).     They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work.

If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement.

Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.

You are looking at $600 for 24GB of VRAM and SR-IOV support. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are in the ""thousands of dollars"" and Nvidia's cards in this segment do not meet the 200W and 24GB of VRAM targets.

It wouldn't be great for marketing if Arc came out at the same time with similar pricing, yet got beaten in the FPS benchmarks.  But productivity cards could wait.

Good driver and application support is not possible to deliver without a significant install base of your product in the wild.

Intel,"It's a really good general purpose card. Perhaps not the best card if you want to squeeze out the most fps out of games, but it performs really well in a wide range of tasks including gaming. And yes 12GB VRAM really comes in handy.  It can easily be found for under $250. B580 is still cheaper than 5060 and 9060 XT and even RTX 5050 and RX 7600, especially in the UK where you can find a B570 for only 20 pounds more than RTX 3050. That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance.

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV is Virtual GPU (SR-IOV is IO Virtualization used to split PCIe lanes into virtual functions so their physical function can be shared between VMs). No consumer cards support Virtual GPU right now besides Pascal/Turing with driver hacks. AMD's SR-IOV offerings are [very limited](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#virtualization-support), [And Nvidia has a bigger selection](https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/gpus-supported-by-vgpu.html) but their budget VGPU options are being phased out (P40).  I believe VDI is Microsoft's implementation. I believe I've done VDI on my RTX 2070 before (I have done seamless sharing between host and VM), but I don't know if it's possible with AMD. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods. Optionally, the P40 is still pretty cheap ($250 used) and doesn't need those hacks at the cost of drawing a lot of power, which Intel has solved with their Battlemage Pro platform (by far the cheapest VRAM/$/W you can get).",Neutral

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Yes, pytorch works, but people care a lot about software longevity and long term vision when buying $5mm+ of GPUs (and these are the purchases Intel cares about that can actually start to offset the cost of development).   The whole purpose behind Falcon Shores (and now Jaguar Shores, if it will even happen) is to put Gaudi performance (i.e. tensor cores) in an Xe-HPC package. Unifying graphics and compute packages is what NVIDIA was able to achieve but not yet AMD, and it's really great for encouraging ML development in oneAPI.

Obviously fixed pass though is an option, but even that isn't without issue. NVIDIA only recently removed the driver restriction, they could add it back at any time.

Intel,"LMAO, I actually have quite a bit of knowledge in this area.  If all you care for is VDI for a small number of VMs, then you'd go GPU passthrough. vGPU / MxGPU often requires higher levels of hypervisor software tier (i.e. VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus), requiring more money. For KVM hosts, setting up vGPU is a lot more difficult and time consuming than just straight up GPU passthrough.  Only two groups of people would be interested in GPU virtualization / splitting:  * Enterprise, in which they wouldn't care about the used card prices.  * Enthusiasts, in which they wouldn't want to pay for vGPU prices anyway. So why bother catering to this crowd?",Neutral
Intel,"Full GPU passthrough is not a solution that many people would consider because it is clumsier than using sr-iov (or potentially VirtIO GPU Venus). Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment.

""SR-IOV (Single Root Input/Output Virtualization) is a PCI Express technology that allows a single physical device to appear as multiple separate virtual devices, significantly improving I/O performance in virtualized environments by giving virtual machines direct access to hardware.

Just get this one and save up for a good psu  Edit: your psu has most important safety features but is nothing to write home about. With a warranty of 5 years. So you should be fine.

Intel,"How does 80% usage point to your GPU needing to be upgraded? The only worthwhile jump for you would be either an X3D chip CPU which is not cheap as you'd have to swap mobo and ram, or going to like a 5070 TI which is only I think like a 30% performance jump for like $750 at best?",Neutral
Intel,"Looks pretty good as is, you are cpu limited though. Running at 1080p? Only thing I would suggest (which is free) is ensuring XMP is enabled and your ram is running st full speed. Other than that, you could try disabling e-cores and/or overclock the P-cores.  Also would you really benefit from more than 160-200fps?",Positive
Intel,"Leave it as is  Tweak your RAM for a bit more negligible performance gains  If you want more out of your current GPU, you'd want to get on the AM5 platform   If you want to ""bottleneck"" more so with a faster GPU, you'll have to upgrade your power supply as well",Neutral
Intel,"I have a 9800X3D and get the same numbers in BF6. I run it at 1080p low.   There's really no point in upgrading. BF6, Arc raiders, Warzone are all CPU-bound games. But they all run very well.   In order for you to get higher than the 160-200fps that you're currently getting in those games, you'll need to either use DLSS and/or Frame Gen (it looks really ugly and fuzzy using DLSS at 1080p); or spend over $1200 upgrading CPU and GPU for what would amount to barely a 40fps increase - if any. DDR5 prices are through the roof and with me being on DDR5, I'm telling you that moving to DDR5 alone is NOT going to give you a performance improvement because your limitation is not memory bandwidth as I already stated I get similar numbers.   Just keep what you have. You got a great rig. No reason to needlessly upgrade your rig when the improvement isn't going to give you what you're looking for. And thats even after selling your old parts.  Overclocking might give you a very tiny bump in performance - but in order to have a stable and reliable overclock, on GPU, CPU & RAM... its incredibly tedious work that takes weeks of testing every single change - for what amounts to usually less than a 10% gain. CPU & GPU already overclock themselves due to algorithmic boost clocks that are based on temperature headroom and the load of the instruction set as it is.",Negative
Intel,Get a cheap AMD second GPU and run lossless scaling 👍 you might need a bigger PSU but overall this is a cheap upgrade path for 2x dos since you'd have to upgrade to a beefier GPU or new mobo+CPU to get gains here.,Positive
Intel,"Your CPU is fine – a 13700KF isn’t holding you back in Warzone/BF. The weak link right now is the RAM. You’ve got 32GB of DDR4-3200, which is pretty slow for that chip. Swapping to a 32GB kit of DDR4-3600 CL16 is cheap and will help 1% lows and overall smoothness.  On the GPU side: even though you “only” see ~80% usage, it can still be the limiter. GPU usage is an average – it can spike to 99% in microbursts, and as long as GPU frame time is higher than CPU frame time, the GPU is what’s capping FPS. In practice, if the GPU is consistently loaded more than the CPU in a game, you’re effectively GPU-bound.  If you want more FPS right now, a 4070 Ti Super or 4080 Super is the logical upgrade. If you’re not in a rush, you could skip a mid-cycle upgrade and wait for a 50-series card (5070/5080/5090) once prices settle – that’ll be a bigger jump per dollar than going from a 4070 to another 40-series card today.  Also, the HYTE Y40 looks great but can be a bit tight on GPU airflow. Adding a couple of bottom intake fans blowing at the GPU is a cheap tweak that helps temps and lets the card hold higher boost clocks.  TL;DR: – Keep the 13700KF – Upgrade RAM to 32GB DDR4-3600 CL16 – You’re still effectively GPU-limited even at ~80% usage – Options: 4070 Ti Super / 4080 Super now or wait and jump to a 50-series (5070/5080/5090) – Add bottom intake fans for better GPU airflow",Neutral
Intel,He's not CPU limited at 40% usage.,Neutral
Intel,"Game's don't use many cores, so CPU usage stays low even when you are cpu limited",Neutral
Intel,"40% utilization on OP's 13700KF can mean there are 4-6 cores that are at 100% utilization.   Most games barely use 6 cores so a CPU that has 16 cores like OPs CPU, a CPU doesn't have to hit 100% utilization in order to be CPU-limited.   Many games behave this way because they are primarily CPU-bound and there really isn't anything you can do about it.   OP upgrading to a 13900k or 14900 MIGHT help, but the performance improvement is going to be so low that it will never actually justify the cost of upgrading.",Neutral
Intel,r/buildapcforme,Neutral
Intel,Excellent bang for buck with drivers getting better and better.,Positive
Intel,They're good if it's a decent bit cheaper than the 9060 xt.  You also need a fast CPU since the b580 scales with how good/bad your CPU is.,Positive
Intel,"Are you buying brand new or used? If you are considering new, I would suggest going used instead as you can get a better card for the same amount of money as a new B580.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it's alright. It's got 12GB of VRAM which is cool I guess but XeSS is not that great compared to DLSS 4 and FSR 4 these days and the performance is slower than a 5060 or 9060 XT 8GB.,Negative
Intel,"I have a B580 linked up to a 4K TV. The only quirk I've really noticed is that changes in resolution, refresh rate or HDR on/off will occasionally cause the TV to hard reboot. I'm not sure if this would happen with a regular PC monitor, but this never happened with the previous GTX 750 Ti I had.  Otherwise performance in games is as expected from reviews. I don't play AAA games in 4K with it, but haven't had crashing issues that some people report.",Neutral
Intel,"with how bad GPU pricing is slated to be due to the memory shortages, I'm starting to consider a B580 so I can at least have a GPU that should be able to play BeamNG in 3440x1440. not keen on having to replace it within less than three years though, but maybe I'm severely overestimating how much GPU I actually need in a realistic gaming scenario. the used market here has been rather dodgy as of late.",Negative

Intel,"Agree, the only high ticket items i buy used are things i can physically fix myself such as cars and bikes",Neutral
Intel,"You are incredibly misinformed. TV upscalers are nothing like DLSS and FSR.  A TV's upscaler really doesn't work all that well in gaming one because they generally don't really make games running at 1080p look like 4K since that's what most TVs are nowadays and this is coming from someone with a 4K Samsung.  Also DLSS and FSR improve performance, reduce motion blur, give better anti aliasing than regular TAA all of which a TV upscaler doesn't do.   Also TV upscalers introduce extra processing lag from the upscaling which DLSS and FSR straight up lower latency because of the performance uplift.",Negative
Intel,"It's technically slower than even the 9060 XT 8GB which is usually around the same price give or take 20-30 bucks. I wouldn't call it ""seriously impressive for the price"" at all it's only saving grace is having 12GB of VRAM but it's got iffy drivers, cpu overhead and a worse upscaler.  It's not impressive at all. It's decent at best. It's cool that it has 12GB of VRAM and that might matter in a handful of games at 1080p at maxed out settings or matter more in 1440p but it really lacks reasonable performance to play the latest games in 1440p without relying on upscaling which it has been surpassed by in FSR4",Negative
Intel,"oh thank you so much for the info. i'd look into that. i'm using a samsung 65"" 4k tv and i usually output 1440p from the gpu via hdmi to the tv and let the tv do the upscaling thing. i'd try enabling the upscaling in gpu and output 4k to the tv and see if i could spot the difference",Positive
Intel,>around the same price give or take 20-30 bucks.  Not the case at all where I live lmao. More like a 100 euro difference between a piece of shit 8gb vram card and the B580.,Negative

Intel,"What are your struggling scenarios that you want to upgrade almost the whole system? Games are not that hard to operate, except if you want absolute graphics quality.",Neutral
Intel,"Coffee Lake is old at this point, and there isn't really a good upgrade path. Even the top dog of that era the 9900k is quite slow by modern standards, and will be a bottleneck for most mid to high end GPUs. I guess you can choose to upgrade just the GPU alone and stick with the 9600k. Just know that in CPU limited games, you most likely will see a substantial CPU bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,"The main thing I am coming across is titles like Monster Hunter: Wilds, Borderlands 4 etc that are both poorly optimised and CPU intensive. In theory my current specs are right on the ""minimum"" specs to play MH:Wilds, but in practice I get barely a stable 30fps at 1080p, even using upscaling and low settings.    I have contemplated just a GPU upgrade (e.g. picking up a 30series GTX), anything newer and I assume I'll end up severely CPU limited. But then I still have a 6 generation old CPU and a few generation old GPU, so probably land in the same situation with the next generation of games. And a 3060 new still costs almost as much as a B580 or RTX5060, so doesn't seem cost effective.",Neutral
Intel,That's why I'm contemplating a full CPU/mobo/GPU upgrade and keeping the ram/SSD/PSU.    Its just not clear to me what a good GPU match for a 13-14 gen i5 (or equivalent AMD) would be so I can keep my RAM. Or even whether it's a good idea at this point to hold on to my RAM (e.g. should I just wait until I can afford a newer system and go full DDR5?,Neutral
Intel,"There are 2 things we can probaly do:  1. Tweaking this old system to squeeze the most out of it for best performance at stable state while gaming. You won't get significant improvements but in other hand, it is free. Your risk is the temperature and voltage. 2. Generational upgrade that cost us minimal changes with most reusable parts.",Neutral
Intel,"Well, there's also the problem that your RAM 2666 is pretty slow for DDR4. Also, whether it's AM4 Zen3 or 12/13/14th gen, you're basically investing in a OLD platforms that's not only slower than modern AM5, but also has no future.   Honestly, i'd stick with Coffee lake at this point, maybe see if i can swap to a 8700k for cheap, and go with a low end GPU like a 5060 or B580 and deal with the CPU issues until prices normalize.",Negative
Intel,"Thanks, that makes sense. I kind of suspected that while my RAM and SSD were compatible with newer systems, but not actually very good anymore (given they weren't exactly cutting edge 7 years ago when I got them) - but it's good to confirm that.   I think I'll look around for cheap/second hand GPU options and otherwise wait around until I can afford a complete system update.",Positive
Intel,"No problem. Your SSD is decent, if a bit smaller capacity. I had this exact same model and it's in my dad's pc right now. 500GB is still ok for a system storage drive if u don't have a ton of stuff. Gen 3 speeds are still more than enough for daily use imo. You'll still need a extra SSD for games if you don't have that.   As for the ram, you could see if u can overclock it to 3000 mhz. If you don't mind used, then it's ok to migrate them to a AM4 b450/550 platform and maybe pair it with a Ryzen 5 5600x . You can probably get the pair for around $150-200 used and elevate some CPU performance issues you'll have. Granted, what I said about investing in old platforms with no future still stands, but if the price is right and you really need the increased CPU performance, then it could be justifiable.",Positive
Intel,"Arc B580 is a good budget card and leagues better then a 3050, just note it will probably struggle on high settings on 1440p. On tomshardware it scored 42.6 FPS on average for 1440p Ultra Rast which included God of War Ragnarök in there game selection.   If you want to play high settings consistently without frame gen at 1440p, I would spend the extra $100 for the 9060XT 16GB. It scored 40% higher then the B580, and cost 40% more. So you're getting same value wise, for price to performance 1440p Ultra.  Also note, Intel GPU's are still new and have the most vary performance with time,  so I would actually imagine the B580 is a bit better then the recorded benchmark I'm refrencing from.

Intel,"Depends on pricing, the B580 is a decent deal in the UK, you can get it here for £200 and a choice of a £60 game out of four options including BF6 so a no brainer for budget builders. Anymore than £200 or the dollar equivalent id just jump to a 5060 or better yet 9060XT 16gb. There will be some CPU bottleneck, but you can get alot of performance out of itself still.",Positive
Intel,4k will get like 60+ in some games 1440p 144+ in most,Neutral
Intel,"4k you can play a considerable amount of games in 60fps, but some games you will struggle, mainly in Nvidia sponsored games, and RayTracing scenes. In 1440p you'll be able to play almost any game no problem, unless it's an extremely poorly optimized game.  Realistically if you're looking to game in 4k and want an AMD GPU, get the RX 7900 XTX, as it has 24gb VRAM in comparins to the 9070xt's 16gb VRAM, which most likely won't be enough for a decent amount of games in 4K. Also, the 7900 XTX performs extremely close to the RX 9070 XT in terms of performance. I was watching a few benchmarks a little while ago because i was going to upgrade.",Neutral
Intel,"At 4K you’ll likely need to use FSR for some games to be playable/smooth, which is no problem since FSR 4 is pretty good.   I use FSR 3 for 4K with my 7900 XTX when I need it, but most games run on >100 FPS anyway and games like Overwatch even at 200+ FPS. If you really want Raytracing/Pathtracing you have to choose between FSR or low FPS",Positive
Intel,"I have a 9070 xt and a 4k screen, I have been on 4k with even my previous 6900 xt. It's 100% worth it for me personally to turn on fsr or lower some settings and be able to enjoy all the pixels.  Almost all my friends prefer 1440p so it's really a personal preference thing.",Positive
Intel,"Depends on your tolerance for 60 fps. If 60 fps is enough then go 4k. A lot of us don't play below 100 gps because it just doesn't look good comparatively, and you can't consistently get over 100 fps at 4k on a 9070xt. I have a 4090 and stay at 1440p.

With some exceptions like Stalker 2, where it's more like 60-80 fps.  Personally I would go 4K if you were getting a TV, but not if you're getting a monitor. To me the jump from 1440p to 4K on a monitor isn't worth it, but it's 100% worth it on a quality TV.  Also, I wouldn't be worried about having to use FSR. FSR 4 quality mode is as good as native anyway. Even performance mode looks great, especially on an OLED TV or something of similar quality.",Neutral

Intel,"I play 4K with the 7900XT (just slightly lower performance than 9070XT) and with FSR3 I get 140-160fps on Battlefield 6 at High Settings. Souls games will be great at 4K since they are frame locked (Elden ring is locked to 60fps). I play any souls like at 4k max settings with no issues and maintain either 60fps or exceed my 165hz monitor in fps. I’m really not sure what games would ever hold you back as far as gpu goes. Unless you are trying to milk every frame in a competitive shooter, in which case, you can just get a dual mode monitor that can swap to a lower resolution (I have a 165hz @ 4K that toggles to 320hz at 1080p)",Positive
Intel,Get an OLED TV like an LG. You're going to hate losing inches.,Neutral
Intel,4K is never worth it for gaming.,Negative
Intel,2k is better,Neutral
Intel,"1440p. No brainer.  I don't recommend 4k, even on a 5090. 1440p is where it's at these days. Get a high refresh 1440p OLED.  I run a 9800x3d, 5080, and 64GB of RAM with a 240hz 1440p OLED. It's incredible. I upgraded to high refresh 1440p from 4k 🙂. 4k was a lot more viable when we were all stuck at 60hz.  I don't even use my 85"" 120hz 4k TV for gaming now.",Positive
Intel,4k with only 60fps in some games? It will get at double or triple that in the vast majority unless you are cranking to the max graphics in super demanding games. At 1440p I would be looking at 240hz monitors for sure. Pretty sure I was playing Wukong with the 7900xt at 100fps on second highest graphics settings,Neutral
Intel,"True, but 9070XT gets FSR4. With the similar raw performance but better upscaler, the 9070XT is a marginally better buy (without discussing differences).   Saying that as an XTX owner that plays in 4K",Positive
Intel,">16gb VRAM, which most likely won't be enough for a decent amount of games in 4K.  Why are you commenting if you don't have the knowledge base to make an informed remark?  16GB is still enough for 4K. 16GB is only a limitation when completely maxing out a very limited handful of games with ray tracing, and the 9070 XT is not fast enough to completely max out new AAA games with ray tracing.  Even newer Unreal 5 games like Stalker 2 doesn't use more than ~11GB of VRAM completely maxed out (without ray tracing).  The 9070 XT will also need upscaling in a variety of games, which reduces VRAM usage by a measurable amount.  The only reason to choose a 7900 XTX over the 9070 XT is if you can find it much cheaper, or you're planning on playing heavily modded games with huge textures.",Negative
Intel,"I also prefer at least 80 fps or more just for the reduced input lag, but 60 actually isn't too bad if you have a VRR capable monitor.  Especially if you use a controller, like on a TV for example.",Neutral
Intel,1440p ≠ 2K,Neutral
Intel,"But for 4k the 7900 XTX is the better choice, specifically because of the extra VRAM. 9070 XT is more future proof, 7900 XTX is a better 4k card. 9070 XT i think has slightly better raw performance.  Future Proof = 9070 XT   Strictly 4k Gaming = RX 7900 XTX   Alternative = wait for RDNA 5 because the price for both 9070 xt and 7900 xtx will probably drop over time",Positive

You're literally specifying here without RayTracing, obviously without RayTracing 16gb is going to be enough. If you have to specify specific settings you cannot use to try and disprove me, then you're argument is trash. Also, the 9070 XT is CAPABLE of RayTracing, and if someones card is capable, their most likely going to want to play using those settings. But there is a VRAM overload, so people have to compromise. Because the 7900 XTX has 8gb more VRAM, you don't HAVE to compromise and you can max out RayTracing without having to worry about VRAM. You're literally cherry picking settings to try to disprove my point.   Also, what if i wanted to mod using my RX 9070 XT but can't because using 4K resolution with max graphics has used up all my VRAM and i have no more headroom? You said the only reason to choose a 7900 XTX is if you're planning on heavily modding games yet you clearly didn't take into consideration someone may want to mod with an RX 9070 XT as well. The RX 9070 XT is widely considered a premium 2k card, not 4k. And it's not considered 4k because playing with 4k max settings with RayTracing usually exceeds 16gb VRAM, and people LIKE RayTracing. So strictly for 4K, people will opt for the 7900 XTX.  RX 9070 XT however is newer, has FSR 4, more updated drivers. But the RX 7900 XTX has way more VRAM headroom, especially for people who want to use RayTracing in 4K, which the RX 9070 XT won't be capable of in a fair number of titles unless you manually choose the settings yourself, and even then you're leaving yourself no headroom for modding. RX 9070 XT is more future-proof in terms of performance, but RX 7900 XTX is more future-proof strictly for gaming in 4K, as games are only going to get more VRAM demanding.  7900 XTX is only better under specific uses, and this specific use being 4K. And that's SPECIFICALLY because of the extra 8gb VRAM.",Neutral
Intel,It's 2.56k and 4k is actually 3.84k,Neutral
Intel,"Uhmm ahhh akthuallii 🤓👆  Yes 2k is not 1440p but almost everyone uses it and people understand that by saying 2k, you actually mean 1440p. Fucking smartass.",Negative
Intel,"The 7900 XTX can't max out ray tracing at 4K, so that's a completely moot point. The amount of ray tracing that card can do at acceptable framerates will never make it go above 16GB VRAM.  And yes, I specifically said to get the 7900 XTX if you want to play games with huge texture mods, but you can still play modded games with a 16GB card just fine. I played a heavily modded Skyrim with almost only 4K textures, and it hovered at ~12.5GB  Sure, people like ray tracing, but that doesn't change the fact that neither of those cards can max out ray tracing - and keep acceptable framerates - to the point where it becomes an issue with regards to their VRAM buffer.  The only way you're doing max settings and path tracing is with performance mode upscaling, at which point you're just not maxing out that 16GB VRAM buffer. Case in point: https://youtu.be/8bEo1dgeRn4?si=Z3WwktPwxqDgsHYK  Max settings + path tracing, barely scratches 11GB dedicated.",Negative

Intel,GPU on top or bottom pcie slot?  All GPU cables plugged in and firmly?  Did you by chance flip the bios 2 mode on the GPU?  Download afterburner and set all settings to default. Then max out the power slider.,Neutral
Intel,I had the same problem when I upgraded my CPU. Turns out my CPU cooler wasn’t properly screwed down and was unevenly placed causing my CPU to have heat spikes and I was having major stuttering and lag. I was so confused because it was a far better and more expensive CPU. If you have an AIO make sure you removed the sticker or that the pump is working correctly,Negative

First, If my PC is off, I have to move my display cable to the integrated slot, then I turn on the PC and let it boot to desktop. After that, I open task manager and watch the graph for my discrete GPU. Obviously the igpu will have all of the fluctuations, but my discrete will stay flat for close to a minute. Then I open steam or YouTube and wait until I see repetitive motions on the graph for the discrete. In my case, I get tiny little mountains back to back.

Unfortunately I really think this may be a bad motherboard, especially with the popping and audio distortions you’re hearing.   Since it’s self built, some cables may not be fully seated. Here is the link to the digital English manual for your motherboard: https://download.msi.com/archive/mnu_exe/mb/MAGX870TOMAHAWKWIFI_English.pdf . You want to find the diagram showing what cables go where. I would:   1) specifically pay attention to the 24-pin power cable (a big ass, stiff ass cable that goes from PSU directly to MOBO, plug is labeled ATX_PWR on the diagram). Make sure it’s fully seated. If you want to unplug it and replug it, be careful as it will require some force but you want to be slow with it.   2) look at the two 8-pin power connectors for the CPU. It’s on the top left of the MOBO (labeled CPU_PWR1 and CPU_PWR2 in diagram). This ones a lot easier to plug and unplug. Make sure BOTH are plugged in and fully seated.   3) Confirm that the power connector to the graphics card is fully plugged in. Do that same unplug and replug. Examine the power connector for signs of damage (mainly burning/melted plastic).   4) You may have already done this, but fully reseat your RAM.   5) Make sure the audio cable is fully plugged into the MOBO. This is on the bottom left of your MOBO and is labeled “JAUD1” on the schematic.  IIRC it’s a funky looking plug, haven’t seen anything else like it.    Apologies if you have already done these steps. The only thing it can really be at this point is the MOBO or possibly GPU related, because your processor seems to be doing its job.

Intel,I know they have different names for the same purpose. Would it be possible I enabled the wrong one?,Neutral
Intel,That is good to know. Thank you for the help!,Positive
Intel,I appreciate the in depth breakdown. For the moment I am trying all the software settings and testing before I start ripping it back open.       During the installation nothing seemed out of place or funny but its been a while since I did a custom build and I can double check that everything works with that.,Neutral
Intel,thats good,Positive
Intel,Get a 3dmark score and compare to similar system scores in the results,Neutral
Intel,"Yes - in your original post you stated you enabled XMP. That could be the source of your problem. I would try disabling any RAM BIOS OC/double check and see if you did set it to XMP, Try Expo 1 or 2.",Neutral
Intel,"Fair enough. Look back through my comment if/when you do tear it open, I’ve made some edits to be more specific and concise. If it helps, I don’t think you’ll need to remove any parts to get to any of the cables I mentioned. (MAYBE have to uninstall GPU to get to the audio cable, MIGHT have to remove CPU cooler to get to CPU plugs, depends on how beefy it is).  EDIT: Also, if you do end up taking the side panel off, feel free to DM me some pictures of the inside. I can try to help more in depth as I’m available.",Neutral
Intel,That's good I guess. Thank you for the help,Positive
Intel,oh yeas good idea i completely overread this and my brain said same thing,Positive
Intel,It seems I mistyped. I did enable EXPO1 not XMD and changed the post to match.,Neutral
Intel,They are both beefy....   But thank you again. I will reread them once I pop it open.,Positive
Intel,just means that it isnt the cpu and or mainboard. could be the gpu or the slot or some weird software stuff,Neutral
Intel,Ok got it. Could be worth trying moving to the more stable Expo 2 or disabling all together… sorry you’re having issues.,Negative
Intel,You may want to just shoot a short video or bunch of photos showing where everything is plugged in.   Take it slow and be sure to show everything.,Neutral
Intel,More ram because this is a amazing build,Positive
Intel,"Get fast 32GB DDR4 RAM (or even more). The rest of the build is well balanced and upgrade meaning completely new system (except PSU and storage). The GPU still good, but produce less fps in new games compare to 5070Ti (own both - personal experience).",Positive
Intel,RAM 32GB (16 * 2),Neutral
Intel,400 CAD for 3080 is good,Positive
Intel,You should also look into getting a new CPU as well that can help your FPS as well.,Positive
Intel,"That's more than I would spend on a used GPU, personally. Who knows how it used and how much life it has left in it? Before I spent that kind of money on a used GPU, I would save a little more for something new from the current generation, like maybe a 5060ti. Not only does it average right about 60fps in pure rasterizarion, without DLSS and frame generation in play, but you would also get the benefit of both of those things, which you will not have with the 3080.  The performance numbers I have were based on a Tom's Hardware review of the 5060ti. I suggest doing your own research, of course.  Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,"A 3080 no, a 3080ti I would consider it but would also check the 4070 if prices are to your wallet. I own a 7800xt and it's a solid 1440p card. Pair it up with a 5700x and you have a solid combo with vram to spare... RT is... capable.  Also, make sure your psu can handle them.",Neutral
Intel,"100%, for the right price. Ive been recommending a used 3080 or used 3080 Ti for over a year now. I also recommend a used 6900 XT. You can get one for like 375 on ebay. Insane value imo",Positive
Intel,"I'm playing arc raiders with a 3080 10gb and 5800x, on 1440p monitor. With graphics set to epic, I'm getting 90-100 fps.",Neutral
Intel,"30 series ain't too old, just try to haggle it down some.",Neutral
Intel,"Seems expensive for a 3080, but it’s still a solid card",Positive
Intel,Yeah the 3080ti is still a very strong card. A 3080ti 12gb is about 20% stronger than a 5060ti 16gb while being about the same price. Though the 5060ti has more VRAM and will have have driver support further down the road while having access to the new DLSS.   Its a reeaally tough choice. 20% extra FPS is more worth it IMO versus the extra Vram,Positive
Intel,yeah it is,Neutral
Intel,"For sure. I can’t afford to upgrade a ton right now, but I figured I could do it piece by piece, starting with my gpu for now yk",Neutral
Intel,Thanks so much!,Positive
Intel,I’ll definitely take this into consideration,Positive
Intel,Wab a 3090ti?,Neutral
Intel,"It’s not a ti.  So potentially 2GB less memory, fewer CUDA cores, and 5-15% less perf. I still think it’s a deal but might want to amend your post.",Negative
Intel,what board and psu do you have?,Neutral
Intel,and you get bonus a.i. cores 😅,Neutral
Intel,"Considered it, but too expensive in my country (used market sucks) and it's a power hog. But a beast of a card.",Negative
Intel,"I can’t remember the exact variant, but I have a b450m matx motherboard. When swapping the gpu I’ll probably be switching out the psu for a 750w or 850w",Neutral
Intel,"that would be wise.  are you eventually going to AM5 in the near future? if not, i would be looking into a slightly newer cpu for better single thread performance and additional cpu cache for gaming.  pick a few out and price watch them. since they are end of life they might go up in price",Neutral
Intel,Check Amazon returns. They have a few older Am4 overstock chips their trying to clear out of inventory that hasn't sold. You can get a really good deal on a chip rn thats better than your current.,Positive
Intel,Sick! Any specific ones worth checking out?,Negative
Intel,"Only 2 worth keeping an eye on upgrade wise from you 3700x since that chip was such a huge value buy is the 5600x3d, 5700x3d. The ones on Amazon get snapped up really fast but you can find one reliably on ebay. That CPU will give future proofing for a long time and keep you from having to make the switch to Am5 and will work really well with current Gen CPU.    Because honestly if it wasn't for ramageddon the normal choice would be to make the jump to Am5 because of the value to performance on the newer 7800x3d and 9800x3d chips.",Positive
Intel,Ramageddon fits rn😅,Neutral
Intel,"Valid point. I’ll keep this in mind 🙏. Regarding the spike in ram prices tho, wouldn’t it make sense to just buy used? I’ve seen some exceptional prices compared to what they’re at right now",Neutral
Intel,Buy a new case and PSU and move your old parts to the new case together with your son. Get yourself more modern computer parts. That's my plan.,Positive
Intel,"Crazy, that's practically the same setup I have... But sadly most of it is pretty much outdated and ""used"" by you - therefore not future proof. So it definitely makes sense to configure a new PC and build it (maybe together with your son) yourself. For around 700-800$ you can get a decent setup that will be futureproof and cost-efficient.",Negative
Intel,"Can go either way. If you see yourself continuing to play AAA games in the next 2-3 years, I would just hand down your current PC to your son. Since he doesn't play AAA games much and assuming his playing on 1080p (For 1440p non-AAA / non resource-intensive games will still work fine with your setup) Same time you could future-proof and get a new medium-end setup for yourself on the AM5 platform, without spending too much although RAM prices are through the roof right now.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't know what everyone's fascination is with the newest greatest thing right now. But, it is unrealistic for many to obtain. Honestly any CPU upgrade 5700 or better. Will have noticeable gains in smoother game play. A newer GPU paired with said CPU will have a big improvement.",Neutral
Intel,"I know what I'm planning to do, build a new pc for myself with my son, then upgrade the motherboard and processor, and cooler, and case then build that with him. Somewhere down the line when he needs a better GPU I'll upgrade that for him. Thank you all for helping with a silly question but it has been on my mind lately, soon he will be into games with me, I can only play so much roblox and Minecraft (seriously burnt out on MC) but again thank you everybody",Positive
Intel,"Upgrade/build a new PC for yourself, and give the old parts to your son.",Neutral
Intel,I just built a new one to continue playing the AAA that I am into and I handed down my older to the kids  Its a AMD 5800x and a 2070super which works fantastic for most games especially Minecraft and RoBlox,Positive
Intel,Ram prices are bad but if it doesn’t matter to you I’d get a new pc with am5 and give your son your current one,Negative
Intel,I was thinking the same thing. I dont want just give him my whole setup. I want him to have his own case style and rgb,Neutral
Intel,Second this. OPs specs are really close to my dad's current computer (r5 3600+2060)! He usually gets to upgrade with my old gear since he's only typically using it for browsing and media consumption. I did get him a new case (Montech XR Wood) and new used cooler (AMD Wraith Prism). Computer is plenty powerful for his needs.,Positive
Intel,"So then I should basically build myself a new pc? I was always planning on building the next one with him either way, just to express how important every piece of equipment is",Neutral
Intel,"I dont see myself playing tons of AAA titles in the future just currently im playing arc raiders and bf6, which seem to be the most graphic heavy currently in my library. I do think I should future proof soon at some point, just not now until ram goes down a tad",Neutral
Intel,Yes i mean I dont need anything crazy like a 5070ti just something I dont need to worry about for another 5 years,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah RAM is bad right now, I dont need to build ASAP Thank-you",Negative
Intel,"Exactly. And maybe there is a M.2 or power supply in your current PC that you can use for your new PC. And for your son, it is a valuable lesson. But I would wait a few weeks because RAM prices are hella expensive atm",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly get a 5700/x or better for the CPU.  Maybe a rx 9060 xt. But there is many GPU options. 3070 ti, 3080, rx 6800 xt ect. Just get a newerish GPU of a high tier or the newest mid low tier. All will be more than adequate.  I'm still using a gtx 1080, but I also haven't seen a game worth playing in the last however many years.",Neutral
Intel,"The 7600X doesn't come with a cooler, you have to buy one separately.  Air cooling would be fine for it.",Neutral
Intel,"First time building, so excuse if im asking stupid questions. So I need one cooler for the processor (the one you put on top of it) and thats it?",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, that is all you would need.  The only other thing would be case fans, but the case you selected comes with those.",Neutral
Intel,Thanks very much,Positive
Intel,"The CPU, RAM, and GPU alone would put you at around $1500(if you’re lucky) if bought separate with the current ram prices.",Neutral
Intel,"I just bought exactly those components, a 5070TI, 9800X3D, RM850X, 2TB NVMe, AIO and a new chassi.  All of this cost me... 2200$, which means that for 500$ less than I spent you get a motherboard and **32GB DDR5 RAM!!!**  That would be a good deal even before the RAM shortage, now its literally just highway robbery.",Negative
Intel,Yeah I think that's a solid price. Should be a very solid rig for a very long time.,Positive
Intel,super job well done and you have done phenomal job finding these deal for you and you are lucky bastard and what type work you do,Positive
Intel,Solid build,Positive
Intel,"With RAM prices, yes, it’s a good deal.",Positive
Intel,yes its good for the price.,Positive
Intel,Woah….,Neutral
Intel,Goddamn. Nicely done.,Neutral
Intel,Oh dude you got a hell of a great deal on that one good sht,Positive
Intel,Why's it matter if ya already bought it?,Neutral
Intel,"these components are great at these prices, considering how AI is drastically impacting prices of computer components. do be aware that cyberpower will ship those out with other parts that just work, like your motherboard may not be pimped out and be basic, but if you’re not really a power user, you’ll be good with that build",Positive
Intel,Feel like its overkill for i need but i felt like i couldnt pass up that deal. It was a little out of budget. I been trying to snag it for 2 weeks it was always sold out in minutes,Negative
Intel,"I trade, so alot of data streaming and platforms running at the same time",Neutral
Intel,Because i can still return it? Til jan 31st,Neutral
Intel,Get more monitor and rams upto 64gb ddr5,Neutral
Intel,You should stare at it unopened until the 30th and ask again .,Neutral
Intel,Make sure the BIOS is up to date to support Resizable BAR for the B580,Neutral
Intel,"I've been seeing the B580 for like $240 new, it's super tempting but I'm trying to hold out for the B770 release.   I know the Intel cards don't have much hype yet but I love how they focused on lower end cards where us broke people really need more options and didn't just come out with some workstation worthy ai card.",Positive
Intel,yes the b580 unboxing experience was very impressive. i love the card,Positive
Intel,"I'm waiting on them to make something that can replace my 3070ti, the minimum performance I want for me to justify an upgrade would be a 9070xt / 5070ti  Intel, i'm waiting, and i'm willing, so show me what you can do.",Positive

Intel,"I was considering getting an Arc, but it didn't seem like a good fit for an AM4 board. It was also kinda too low end to be a worthwhile upgrade from my previous card, while the 9070 XT was one.",Negative
Intel,"I would've got the b580, but it only has 8 lanes.  So I got the 9060xt.  I'm playing on a gen 3 system, so l would loose a bit of performance.",Neutral
Intel,"Not touched arc yet, waiting for them to compete at the mid-high end before I take a serious look",Neutral

Intel,"Got a B580 at a great price, small upgrade from my 6700XT which went to another build. Great 1440p performance paired with my 5900X.",Positive
Intel,"A770 Owner here. Was between 4060-7600XT-A770 this year, video games was a second focus but wanted to go more for productivity (in a budget). 4060 was fine, but the 8gb VRAM make me go for the other 2 options, mainly if I get to edit very big things in high res., it would be hard to do.  And between 7600XT and A770... The A770 gets 4070 performance on video edition, and Intel codes are far better than AMD. Gaming performance they are almost the same... So far very happy with my purchase.  Since the start of the year, doing the same workflow, with driver updates I got to shave a total of 5 minutes on each video render. At the start was 20m, rn is 15m with the same type of edition. And driver bugs? 0, enever needed to reinstall drivers.",Positive
Intel,The $250 price point is compelling to me for the specs.   But does it handle games well? That's what I want to know; $250 is a pretty big purchase for me right now.,Positive
Intel,"I mean i sort of do? My ultra 7 155h laptop has an arc igpu, if that counts",Neutral
Intel,"Had a A770 and it was great, only reaon I moved away was VR. If they could support VR I would go back. Prices are better, it worked really well, the software was great and dev support was amazing.  Halo Master Chief Collection wasn't running well. Raised a support ticket and in a month they fixed it.",Positive
Intel,"They don’t make anything powerful enough for what I want out of a gaming PC but they’ve made strides and if they keep it up, I could see them continuing to improve, maybe having xx60 competitors in a couple of years.",Positive
Intel,"I use an A770 16GB for gaming on the 4K TV. Mostly older or lighter games, but in Forza Horizon 5 with the help of XESS there's no problem with high-ultra settings in 4K. hitting rock solid 60fps",Positive
Intel,I have a A770 and I'd say it performs about on par with my 3070 for most games I play. Honestly interested in seeing what more they can do with better hardware design and continued work on improving their drivers.,Positive
Intel,"A770, really liked it for it's price point, even though it was a pain at first. Solid at 1440p.   I'll get the b780 if it ever releases.",Positive
Intel,I've got the A770 16 gig and it seems fine.  Hard to tell with games if it's my GPU or the game being next gen ready. I came from a gtx 970 so it felt like a massive upgrade. I remember Balder's gate being real low fps in act 1 on the 970 but very decent on the A770 at 1440. Hunt showdown also gets 90+ fps in busy areas but has had issues dropping to very choppy fps when things are happening close. With Hunt it's very hard to tell what the issue is as it has frequent issues that effect many gpus at the same time. Like a friend playing on amd had different issues at the same time as I did. Honestly couldn't tell you if I've turned the graphics up from low since I had that issue. A770 runs armored core 4 really well to the point that I haven't had to mess with any settings or check fps.,Positive

Intel,"I don't use it, but I appreciate there being more options available for people.",Neutral
Intel,It's okay at best,Positive
Intel,B580 at 1080 so far so good. Can lock 60fps ARC Raiders max settings or drop down from max a level and 120fps,Positive
Intel,"I picked up a B580 for stoopid cheap secondhand and am using it to learn about local LLMs on my linux rig for future home automation. Works fairly decent, but my benchmark options are limited on linux for now. It runs a bit warm at idle without an undervolt (55° - 60° C).",Positive
Intel,If they ever release a single fan battlemage card akin to the a380 I'd buy one for my sub 5L build for sure... Tempted as it is by the sparkle a380 but I keep hoping for better especially since the b50 pro is a thing.,Positive
Intel,"Not me really, irs rare to find one here also",Neutral
Intel,It’s great for a budget build but I wanted something higher-end so I went for the 9070XT,Positive
Intel,I wish I could. But my friends have outspoken this idea from me. Ended up with a laptop and RTX card in it.,Neutral

Intel,"Yes, got a B580 for MSRP, and put it into my custom Steam Machine!",Positive
Intel,"I mean, is it? While the price to performance *seems* to be good, from what I’ve heard, the drivers kind of suck, and it doesn’t really work well with actual budget CPUs.  It’s good on paper, but it’s not really a mature product yet. I’d guess that by the next generation, they’d be more caught up with the competition at that price range.",Negative
Intel,"I have one in my jellyfin and its been amazing doing 3 transcodes at a time and not sucking up too much power, along with some misc server tasks like trickplay.

Intel,"I have an A770 in my rig, genuinely never had a problem unless it was Fallout 3",Positive
Intel,I had a B580 near launch. Was my replacement for a 1080ti at the time. It was totally fine for my use case. I did upgrade to a 4080 later but that was more due to my use case changing (built a sim racing rig with a large format 4k TV) than the performance of the card itself. I was also quite partial to the understated looks of the card,Positive
Intel,"Ive used plenty of Arcs and have enjoyed the performance and compatability.  The 1 weird thing is in one older game I played, the game defaulted to my PCs AMD iGPU, and wouldnt run on the Arc without disabling the iGPU in the BIOS.

It also has a dedicated RTX 3050Ti, I have been surprised that leaving the RTX disabled I'm still able to emulate PS2 and 360 (Xenia) perfectly. I only use the RTX for heavier Steam games due to heat output and power consumption.

Intel,A750 in a second build. Great for 1080p in most games,Positive
Intel,It's an amazing value. I used one after my 4090 and was kinda shocked how well it played COD and Warzone.,Positive
Intel,"Got an Arc B580 for the price/performance ratio, coming from an RX 5700 XT. Was a good bit of an upgrade in a lot of newer games. Honestly think it's a great card for that purpose.  Unfortunately, I ran into poor performance that was a no-go for me. Yakuza Kiwami had a huge issue (ran at like 50-55 fps with horrible lows that made it jittery, while my 5700 XT easily pushed 144, which makes sense, it's basically a PS3 era engine with better assets). From what I can tell, 0, Kiwami 2, and YLAD all had the same issue, and they got fixed over the course of a few years. The problem with that is that 0 was reported on the forum like 2 years before it was fixed. I was in the middle of a playthrough and couldn't just wait for reasonable, playable performance. I even tried DXVK and got a big boost (like 90-100ish), but it was still very unstable.  So you really do have to beware of older games still, despite the drivers having improved a lot and being overall solid. Some other DX11 titles ran perfectly fine though.  OpenGL performance? Forget it. Necesse uses Java and OpenGL and I managed about 70fps before using Mesa for Windows to get a boost. Still wasn't ideal compared to my 5700 XT, once again (and AMD isn't known for OpenGL performance on Windows lmao).  So overall, I think it's a great piece of hardware with mostly solid drivers, but it's not good enough for me on the driver side and I don't want to wait. It lasted 2 weeks before I returned it and got a 9060 XT 16GB (which is again a good bit of an upgrade from the B580, so the extra cost doesn't hurt as bad. I've been waiting for so long for an upgrade that made sense to me).  This was all in the middle of last month. Got my 9060 XT on the 30th.  I'd also like to note that they did alleviate most of the CPU overhead issues recently, so my 5600G wasn't an issue in games that did run well, like The Finals (actually ran extremely well with maxed out settings, and XeSS is actually really good on the Arc cards).",Positive

Intel,"The B580 is scratching an itch I cannot even begin to describe in adequate terms.  It is the default card for my 2-gamer builds now.  Since it's an 8x card, any consumer grade motherboard with two x16 slots that split the primary slot lanes when both are populated ultimately does not suffer a dip in performance.  Plus the linux friendly nature of the cards means that I can pack a double-bazzite PC in my bag and take anywhere.  It makes road trips and game nights significantly easier.",Positive

Intel,"its a productivity beast, but if youre frames are uncapped and your gpu isnt getting to 100 percent usage, youre cpu bottlenecked, as most games only use 1 or 2 cores usage percentage means very little",Neutral

Intel,I'm assuming 8 pcie lanes,Neutral
Intel,"8 pcie lanes instead of the usual 16 so half the bandwidth for a given generation.  The PCIe bus is used to share information between the card and the rest of the system. It's usually not a bottleneck (the GPU can't process data as fast as it comes in through the bus), but it's a noticeable one when you're low on VRAM and the GPU needs to fetch data in the system RAM through the PCIe bus. Mostly an issue with 8 GB cards like the 5060.",Neutral

Intel,"If I were to get one for my kiddo, would I expect more troubleshooting for Steam games or ability to play less of them?",Neutral

Intel,Deshrouding rules,Neutral
Intel,"No, I don't do a lot. The main goal wa to use it as a display GPU, but the AV1 encoding is a nice bonus. I run OBS in replay mode (10 minutes) in the background and this intel GPU is used for encoding.  I want my Nvidia GPU to not have any monitors connected to it, so I can switch between using it in my host OS and in the VM, here's an example of how it works: [https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU](https://youtu.be/3fiXFv85iRU)  This allows me to for example stream a game directly from a VM to my TV and still use my PC to do something else, like for example few weeks ago we played Trine 2 with my brother, when I was running the game in both the VM and host (one copy on Nvidia and one on Intel) and we played multiplayer together.  I used to use the VM to play everything like year or two ago, but the Nvidia drivers on linux improved significantly, so nowadays I don't use it nearly as much, but I still do from time to time. Plus it's always nice to have a backup plan for running some anticheats.",Positive
Intel,"I'm using looking-glass. It's a bit different than parsec, it works by copying frames from the main GPU's framebuffer into the shared system memory segment and then to the 2nd GPU's memory. No compression and very low latency (I use virtual display in my Windows VM that I can set to 500Hz, which gives me around 2.5ms of added latency in total).  I also use Sunshine and Moonlight when straming to a TV or remotely to my laptop or phone. I have the cheapest server in OVH that I use as a VPN, so I can access my PC or share some services over internet (like my personal cloud for example: [https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM](https://cloud.yayuuu.pl/index.php/apps/memories/s/pKqfn86wLLy6xZM) ), so I can game from anywhere, just login over SSH to my home server, wake on lan PC, start a VM and connect using Moonlight).",Neutral
Intel,"Good point, I guess it isn't necessarily the best gaming CPU, but I quite like its speed for compiling etc.  Getting some 5xxx CPU seems like just a small step up and wouldn't be cheap. And anything even higher would mean basically replacing everything: Mainboard, RAM and CPU. Going with a lower core count and higher boosts might be better for gaming, but would feel like too much of a downgrade.  Ironically most games, which I play besides Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, are such old titles, that both GPU and CPU are complete overkill. And lately I found just far too little time for gaming in general to make it worth it with the current prices to get some DDR5.  Edit: I just checked and at least according to Wikipedia the Ryzen 5000 CPUs aren't clocked all that differently. Its successor the 5900X has a boost of 4,8GHz, but same core count and same L3 cache and same TDP.",Neutral
Intel,I don't know what that means in layman's terms. Does it cap bandwidth like older hdmi resolution? Does it limit my kid's Minecraft terrain generation range? Does it mean I only run 69 mods on Skyrim instead of 420?,Neutral
Intel,"To be fair I don't play *that* many different games, but I haven't come across one that simply doesn't work. The biggest game compatibility issue I ever ran into was with StarCraft Remastered not rendering at full resolution. My theory is that they were specifically checking for Intel (what would've been only slow iGPUs at the time) and disabling high resolution. Blizzard fixed it though thankfully.   This video is over a year old, so things have only improved since then. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the issues shown have been addressed: https://youtu.be/Y09iNxx5nFE",Negative
Intel,For what I've played using an A750 card on steam the only game I've ever had issues with is Kenshi which would crash out on me for whatever reason but nothing else seems to have any noticeable issues.,Negative

Intel,"It’s cool you’ve got the best GP that’s ever U-ed and it’s even cooler that you made it suck less (power), but the reason people are diasgreeing with you is because you’re defending an inarguably bad design with the argument of “but it works on my machine”.",Positive
Intel,"Your not a clown, you’re the whole circus buddy",Neutral
Intel,"Wait, if you don't connect your Nvidia to monitors, does that mean the thing you see on monitors is only rendered by the Arc?    So, is it like how you stream from game pass? Where you let other PC run and calculate the game (your VM in this case) and then stream the game on your host OS?    Are there advantages in doing this? How are the graphics compared to directly using your Nvidia?  When you say that you rarely play on the VM nowadays, do you mean your Nvidia is connected to the monitors? Or is there a way to split the task without VM?  Also when you played Trine 2, does that mean the game looks better on TV than your PC? Since Ark is weaker.  Sorry for asking many questions lol",Neutral
Intel,"😂 Just has less bandwidth, but still really damn good.",Negative
Intel,"It caps the bandwidth. But that's fine because it's not strong enough to even utilize the full bandwidth that 16 lanes would provide. And those extra lanes would just increase cost.   This *may* be a problem on an old motherboard, because 8 lanes of PCIe *may* be too little (idk, didn't see any tests). But 8 lanes of PCIe4 are more than sufficient.",Negative
Intel,"You need to change your expectations if that is your point.  If you buy a stick of RAM today, it is going to run at half speed if you don't go into the bios and correct it. If you don't want to tune your PC, don't build one yourself.",Negative
Intel,Looks like we found someone poor AND stupid over here.,Negative
Intel,"https://preview.redd.it/5utu2xxvee1g1.png?width=5240&format=png&auto=webp&s=a281c9815d6408496deeaa752ed61862de335754  No, I can choose which GPU I use for rendering. That's basically what laptops are doing this with multiple GPUs. I just set these environmental variables in the steam's launch parameters: DXVK\_FILTER\_DEVICE\_NAME=""NVIDIA"" \_\_NV\_PRIME\_RENDER\_OFFLOAD=1 \_\_GLX\_VENDOR\_LIBRARY\_NAME=nvidia   and it will run on Nvidia. I can do the same with any other app, like browser, blender, etc. The screenshot shows an example of the game running bare-metal on nvidia-gpu and being displayed on intel GPU.  To not repeat the same parameters with every game, I've made a simple bash script that just exports these variables (and few more, like DLSS upgrade, etc), so I just type ""setenv %command%"" in steam lauinch parameters and that's it.  When running a VM, I use looking-glass, which is different than streaming the game to another device over LAN (like in your example with gamepass). Looking-glass uses shared memory to copy frames from one device to another, so it only works within one PC, but the video is uncompressed and with minimal latency (like 2-3ms of added latency). This is essentially the same path as offloading rendering but with one additional limitation - windows forces vsync, so I need to run as high refresh rate inside windows as possible to reduce latency. I use Virtual display adapter that allows me to set up to 500Hz and run desktop without any physical monitors attached.",Neutral
Intel,"Trine 2 is not that demanding, both GPUs can run it at max settings just fine. This is also true with a lot of older games. With new games it wouldn't work like this, but there is another way. Linux has a built-in multiseat, that allows logging in 2 different users at the same time, giving them access to different monitors, input devices, etc. I could use a 4k dummy plug to enable multiseat on that device and stream from there to the TV, but I don't have it configured right now, as I still need VM sometimes, so usually it's enough.",Neutral
Intel,"So like a v6 Camaro? Not as fast at the suped up v8, but still better than a Corolla?",Neutral
Intel,"I think it’s less about “not getting the full performance”, and more about it being a fire hazard.   Especially when you pay that kind of money for it.    In fact, one could argue that the consumer shouldn’t be able to make your product into a fire hazard, even if they aggressively fuck around with software parameters. As long as no modifications were done to the hardware - it should be perfectly safe. Sure it may not function properly, but it shouldn’t melt itself.",Negative
Intel,"Your ram clocks actually depends on your other hardware, its not the case for gpu. Its fine that you like it, but other may not, and nothing on the box say i need to understand something about overcklocking\\downcklocking. Also i doubt that some random dude will spend time to play with your gpu settings if you buy prebuilt, you will just get it as it is.",Neutral
Intel,"More like the transmission than the engine. PCIe lanes determine how much compute (horsepower) can get to the CPU (Road) so if your GPU (Engine) is performing really well but is bottlenecked by PCIe lanes, you aren't really getting that level of performance.   It's also why this objection to the Intel cards is a bit of a moot point. If you are running a v6 than you don't need the best transmission, the car isn't making the power to necessitate more HP to the wheels.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm the guy that bypasses restrictive software and hardware to do what I want, so I won't advocate for any more dummy proofing. That is one of the reasons I hate Apple.",Negative
Intel,"So sounds like an Average Joe won't notice, especially compared to other cards of the same price?",Neutral
Intel,"I don’t mind tinkering(in fact I enjoy it a lot, both at my job as a software dev, and as a hobby).  However, hardware+firmware(when not modified) should not allow software to set unsafe parameters, period.

Intel,"No I did not over or underclock other than inside the AMD adrenalin program. But I got it back to default after getting those errors. But they keep happening.   Also, A-XMP is not active in my BIOS.",Negative

Intel,"Remove all but one stick of RAM and rerun the memory test, see if you can identify whether the errors follow one or more specific sticks.",Neutral

It was like John Wick heard someone talk shit about his pup and took it out on the whole lobby. Anyways, I was talking to the three of them when two players departed and left me alone with another guy, wearing a flat rimmed hat. Dude and I would talk some more, I would even point out some items he'd want and ask if he's looking for anything specific, and the moment I loot the next player, he guns me down and takes my shit.

Intel,"Not really. If you have a slower cpu (I have a 5600x) DirectX 11 games will run like shit. CS2 for me runs so bad my gtx 1650 almost manages to beat the b580 in all benchmarks I did. Switch over to vulkan, which in cs2's case is very poorly implemented and sucks in comparison to dx11, with visual glitches and crashes being frequently, and the performance improves in almost 30% in all tests I made. This is not the case with any other card. AMD and Nvidia cards will present a drop in performance on cs2 when using Vulkan. The exact same issue is present in squad44 and most other dx11 or older games I tested (Watch Dogs, Far Cry 4, GMOD), as soon as I switch to a newer api like dx12 for Squad or dxvk for those older games, the performance improves drastically. I already reported this problem to Intel in their forums, but so far nothing. I'm not the first one to do so either, so I doubt Intel will fix them anytime soon, if they fix it at all. DirectX 12 and vulkan games run flawlessly, I just finished the remake of silent hill 2 at epic settings and ray tracing on, and the b580 performed really well, even for such a badly optimized game like sh2r.

To even make a Unity game work on WindowsXP, you have to enable an OpenGL renderer, which even then requires ICD features only supported on SM4.0 hardware.  If you do target DX9 or DX9Ex, you're really hurting what you can do. You can't use pixel data with vertex data, there's no generic ""This is just FP32"" data type, you can't get antialiasing working right (the driver has to be ""hinted"" and probably won't listen) and you can't read coverage or colour samples. The CPU can't read VRAM in any sensible way, you can't use more than 2 GB of it *and* you have all the limitations Shader Model 3.0 imposes, so very good luck in trying to run any non-immediate shader program.  DX9 does not get the job done. It's debatable whether it did back in the day. It was such a fucking mess that Microsoft just gave up on it and the game would *bundle the goddamned DX9 DLLs with its own executables* because how the hell does a user know if one game needs DX9 August 2004 and and another needs d3dx9\_32.dll but won't work with d3dx9\_41.dll.

I have the latest bios installed as well, and set my PCIe lane to 4.0. I ran several CapframeX benchmarks, the result is the same no matter what driver version, and it's consistent. If you still have your 5600x and your B580 and you want to see for yourself, CS2 is free, do any sort of benchmarking, you can't miss it, the game runs terribly on DX11 and will magically get 30% more performance on Vulkan, despite CS2's Vulkan being a translation layer afaik, that's why other cards get less fps when using it. Same results so far with every single DX11 or older game, Squad44 is literally unplayable for me on DX11, less than 60 fps at any graphics settings, switch to DX12, and magically I can run it at 1080p high settings at at least 120. As a last effort, I'm thinking about trying to use Windows 11, but I already met someone who has the same issue on CS2 and he's was using Windows 11, so I doubt Windows 10 is the problem. If you have any other ideas, I would love to hear it, but so far I noticed even the benchmarks Intel does in their forums present this issue, but they are camouflaged because Intel run their tests at 1440p and high settings, so in their tests, CS2 runs around 10% slower than the 4060, but no sane person plays a competitive shooter at 1440p high settings, most CS players literally play the game in 4:3 resolusion just to squeeze some frames, which makes the game more CPU bound.

It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral

Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral

Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Neutral
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative

Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Negative
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative

Intel,welcome to amd,Neutral
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative

Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative

Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
Intel,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
Intel,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral

Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral

Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative

Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Neutral
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Negative
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Neutral
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive

Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral

Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
Intel,"Don't do that, i'm suffering with both 7900XTX + RVII (and even with RX6400)",Negative
Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Negative
Intel,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination. I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows.

Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.  (assuming we're talking about games)",Negative
Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative
Intel,"There is not really a clear limit. More PCIe bandwidth makes scaling efficiency better, less means the software will run a bit slower in multi-GPU mode. 3.0 x4 (~3.3GB/s) is just enough for reasonable efficiency.",Neutral

Intel,"Indeed, people forget that the speeds electricity travels is slow in the computer world.   Kinda why the RAM slot closer to your CPU performs so good. And why benchmarkers will use that slot, and not the one furthest from the CPU.  Same with NVME m2 SSD, the closest slot is the best one. PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.  Guess that is why we have 5090 these days. At about double the price of the old flagships.    You can view that as SLI i guess :P",Neutral
Intel,"Iirc Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider were the only games to support the used of mixed multi GPU (at least mainstream) other than ashes.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive
Intel,"Unless you're running a CPU that's *many* many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about. Whether AMD has less overhead or Nvidia has less, it really doesn't matter.",Neutral
Intel,"On an older post an Intel graphics engineer explained the issue, it isn't what you said. Intel is too verbose in commands which slows everything down.",Negative
Intel,I'm fairly sure they use dxvk for d3d9 to 11.,Neutral

Intel,Battlemage drivers use the cpu for software accelerating certain processes that are not being hardware accelerated in the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Glad you brought up Nvidia as I didn’t know this had improved until the testing around Arc showed it had gone.,Positive
Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral
Intel,"The overhead is minimal for both AMD GPUs and NVIDIA GPUs, which is probably why reviewers didn't look at the overhead until Intel GPUs came along.",Neutral
Intel,"> Unless you're running a CPU that's many many years old, GPU overhead is not really something you need to worry about.   That's just not true with Battlemage.  CPUs released in 2024 showed the issue in testing.    It's not year of release, it's capabilities.",Negative
Intel,"Intel uses software translation for DX11 and lower, so it does matter for them.",Neutral

Intel,I always dreamt of the day APUs become power houses.,Neutral
Intel,"Is it my expectations being too high or this ain't a huge uplift? To go back to the classic: hopefully Zen 6 with RDNA 4 will offer a bigger uplift. We only have to wait a year and a half...  Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.

Then super budget-friendly Strix Halo will come next year and take the RTX 2080's lunch money. Game over Nvidia.",Positive
Intel,"Strix Halo is rumored to be a whopping 40 CUs of RDNA3.5 so...   That'll do it no sweat, if they release it.",Neutral
Intel,almost there,Neutral
Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.

This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.

After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.

The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.  Why did it take some random (me) to have to publicly embarrass the company before we saw any action on bugs reported by their loyal paying enterprise clients?",Negative
Intel,">AMD is working with Amazon and Azure on systems with 1-4 GPUs supporting SR-IOV/MxGPU. This is only with ""Pro"" or ""Instinct"" cards though.  and MSFT, but we are not seeing these changes upstream via open standards. We still are lacking working support for the likes of Nutanix and Proxmox (both KVM), where Redhat has some support but there are still unresolved issues there.  Fact of it, the changes AMD is pushing at AWS would upstream to every other KVM install and bring those fixes to mainstream. But this has been going on for well over 6 years that I can recall and still we are no closer to a ODM solution released to the masses. I had hopes for RDNA2 and I have expectations for RDNA3+/CDNA3+ that are just not being met outside of data sciences.",Neutral
Intel,"I am a FOSS software developer, on hand right now I have several examples of every card you just listed, including almost every generation of NVidia since the Pascal, Intel ARC, Intel Flex, AMD Mi-25, AMD Mi-100.

I have no horse in this race, I am not picking on AMD vs NVIDIA here, I am trying to get AMD to fix things because we want to use their products.  You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic? How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?

I provided evidence to show that they are not rock solid and do, from time to time have issues.  This is not overstating anything, this is showing you, and the post above you, are provably false in this assertion.  Just because you, a sample size of 1, have had few/no issues, doesn't mean there are clusters of other people experiencing issues with these GPUs.  \> And umm yeah, Nvidia also have bug / feedback report tools....  Yup, but did they need to make a large press release about it like AMD did. You should be worried about any company feeling the need advertise their debugging and crash reporting as a great new feature.  1) It should have been in there from day one.  2) If the software is stable, there should be few/no crashes.  3) You only make a press release about such things if you are trying to regain confidence in your user-base/investors because of the bad PR of your devices crashing.

I would absolutely *love* to see 4K TV manufacturers offer DisplayPort in future TVs, but that's probably not happening anytime soon.   About Nova you're probably right. But please keep in mind, that its scope is much more narrow than any other open source driver out there. Mostly, it only serves as an adapter between the Linux kernel and GSP firmware. Current Noveau implementations reflect this: GSP features are easier to implement and thus currently more feature complete. And since there is an AI/Nvidia hype train at the moment, they will probably also dedicate more resources into it than say stratis-storage.",Neutral

Intel,"The price of the GPU is not determined by the transistor count, but by the DIE size.

How often have you assumed this is the game's fault?  I'm not the guy you're replying to, but for me, almost never.  I've had exactly one driver-based AMD issue - when I first got my 5700XT on release, there was a weird driver bug that caused the occasional BSOD when viewing video in a browser - this was fixed quickly.  My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

Intel,"> You state you never had issues, however, how many times have you had a game randomly crash with no error/fault or some random error that is cryptic?

Same for when I was on Polarix with RX 470s.  Game crashes are rarely the fault of the graphics driver (or hardware), regardless of brand.  This isn't a good point to be making, because it's just wrong.  > suffered from a silicon bug in it's PSP crippling some of it's core functionality  This again?  No, Radeon VII and other Vega products were killed off because they were very expensive to produce and they weren't moving enough units at any price to justify any further investment or even any meaningful support.  Everyone paying attention called this when they revealed Vega, and even long before with the tragic marketing.  Insert the GIF of Raja partying at the AMD event, complete with cigar.  People love coming up with theories as to what critical flaw or failure point caused a given generation of AMD GPUs to suck, and how those will be fixed in the next generation.  From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.  But to act like there's 1 critical flaw, or that something is fundamentally broken and making the cards unusable for a given purpose, or to cite George Hotz as an authority is just way off target.",Negative
Intel,"Part of it is rooting for the underdog, part of it is probably due to people legitimately not having problems.

Intel,"Good ol' ""it works on my machine"".  It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means? Probably has never google'd them, despite the fact one of the most well-respected FOSS wizards in this scene is trying to communicate with them.

Intel,"Firstly, i am barely even able to find any posts about this issue. Which means that issue is extremely case specific, so you should not categorically blame AMD and Adrenaline. With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default.

However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss.

So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023).

Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080.

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.  They got anyway already confused with fsr3 and fsr2 ( cause 3 is fsr frame gen and up scaling it's not like dlss where 2 is up scaling and 3 is frame gen)",Negative
Intel,Very similar performance I guess,Neutral
Intel,Ye,Neutral
Intel,They've been using it since forever. The difference is that PC GPUs were 10x faster than console GPUs so there was no need for it on PC.,Neutral
Intel,"It mentions dlss, fsr3 and xess support, doubt they limited it to dlss2.",Neutral

Intel,Honestly... Maybe fsr3 frame gen can help you but... A 3300 Was already outdated when it came out.,Negative
Intel,Most likely the upgrade part called FSR 2 and the frame creation part called FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,If they didnt get confused between FSR 3 and 2 then yes fsr 3 roughly doubles fps same for AFMF.,Neutral

Intel,"with AFMF it works , didnt test with FSR3 now.",Neutral
Intel,Reading before raging :),Neutral
Intel,"It is even low quality with 30fps and still needs 5700 ~~XT~~. That is pretty bad :D  *Corrected to 5700, which I think is still a lot for FSR2 at low fullHD, but definitely cheaper GPU.",Negative
Intel,That's with 5700 and 1070.... WHAT exactly are you expecting those cards to do in visually demanding AAA titles in 2023?  People have some crazy expectations. Everyone wants the eye candy but no one wants to pay the performance cost.,Negative
Intel,For 30fps even lol,Positive
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Positive
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Positive
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral
Intel,"dlss looks better than native with TAA because taa is so bad, but dlaa/fsraa at native >>>> upscaling",Negative
Intel,you think engine devs can pressure AMD and even Nvidia? Come on man. Be real.,Negative
Intel,"Ever notice how multi-GPU vanished the moment DX12 shifted the onus from AMD/Nvidia over to the developers?

Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Neutral

Intel,"Uhm, me btw...",Neutral
Intel,"> Who actually plays games at native these days, if it has upscaling?  I do.",Neutral
Intel,"I won't judge your preferences, but at least using native rendenring isnt the clown show we have here. Native 4k look the same no matter what gpu render it (performances aside). Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.

I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Negative
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative
Intel,Or the game performs at 50 fps at 1080p low on 5700 but 50fps is a weird number to target and they can't say 60 so they just say 30fps and call it a day.,Negative
Intel,Not if it's using mesh shaders like Alan wake. In that game the GTX 1650 outperforms the 1080ti.,Neutral
Intel,The game is raytracing only with a ridiculous ammount of foooliage.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm so glad this is finally getting more main stream spotlight.

Intel,i wonder when dual rank and dual channel will start being listed too. since dual rank does help gaming,Neutral
Intel,Honestly my 1070 still runs great for what it is. It’s in my sons rig now because it couldn’t keep up with 1440p depending on the game and definitely not 4k. Still a fairly solid 1080p card.,Positive
Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Neutral
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral
Intel,Spoken like someone who has never upscaled 1080p content on a 1440 screen. The pixel ratios are all off. It's fucked.  1440p is perfect for watching old 720p HD content though.,Negative
Intel,Completely agree.,Negative
Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative
Intel,I see the 5700 and the GTX 1070 on the minimum specs. Are those cards going to be RT capable for this game? (It's 30FPS LOW with FSR but still.),Neutral
Intel,"Sometimes the DigitalFoundry reviewers use their meme powers for good (eg:fighting shader compilation stutter), but their  >""it's better than native!""   memeing about upscaling seems to have gone sideways.",Negative
Intel,"Dude tells truth, go to Nvidia sub, and you fond every second post someone telling that DLSS looks better then native, and every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote.",Negative

Intel,">I guess the wonders of everyone jumping on the Swiss knife engine approach ue rather than doing their own engines made for their games.  Facepalm...  Avatar Frontiers of Pandora very literally uses a custom engine, not Unreal Engine.",Neutral
Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Neutral
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral
Intel,"Took a look at some gameplay on YouTube, and it does look nice enough, though water looked like ass, and as mentioned already, it's an in-house engine (which is nice to see TBH).",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Positive
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Positive
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Negative
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.

Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Neutral

Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game.

Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid.

Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD.

Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative

Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral

Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Negative
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative

Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral

Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Neutral
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral

Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Positive
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Negative
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Positive
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

Intel,"I have a 13900KF-4090 rig and a 7800X3D-7900XTX rig. They are connected to a C2 OLED and to a Neo G9.  I've been holding on to play the game till 2.0 update. I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive
Intel,"If you have the HW, go all out. That's why we spend on these things.  I'm getting the best experience you can get in the premiere visual showcase of a good game.   It's path tracing.

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,People need to change their mind frame. AI is here to stay and will be a major part of graphics rendering going forward.,Neutral
Intel,I played 2.0 yesterday with 2k ultra and path tracing with 155fps (DLSS3.5),Neutral
Intel,"The 4060 Ti literally better than the 7900 XTX in RT, cope snowflakes!111!11! /s",Positive
Intel,"So Nvidia only needs to increase their RT performance 3x while AMD needs to do 14x. We are not seeing that within a decade, if that.",Neutral
Intel,Sounds like Ray tracing isn’t ready for prime if nothing can run it and you have to use AI smoke and mirrors to fake it playable. I’ll worry about Ray tracing when it’s a toggle on or off like shadows and there is no major performance hit. See you in the 9000-10000 series of Nvidia or 12000-13000 series for AMD.,Negative
Intel,Native resolution is a thing of the past. DLSS looks better than native anyway.,Neutral
Intel,Is this with DLSS + FG?,Neutral
Intel,"Ray tracing already wasn't worth it imo, that's why I saved money buying an AMD card. It's not worth the cut in frame rate that then has to be filled with upscaling that makes frames look blurry anyway, so what's the point of even using it?",Negative
Intel,"Meanwhile me using medium settings + performance dlss on 3080 ti to get that locked 120fps. I just can't go back to 60fps. The game still looks amazing, especially on blackstrobed oled.",Positive

Intel,No one is using these settings.,Negative
Intel,"Ray tracing is fun and all, but games have really improve much.. Same animations.. Same type of quest... Same listening to notes.. There have to be better ways....",Positive
Intel,"4K rendering for games like this is pretty pointless unless you're upscaling it to a massive 8K display via DLSS Performance.  Ultimately, the final image quality is going to be more affected by how clean the Ray / Path Tracing is than whether you're rendering at Native 4K or not.",Negative

Intel,"Yes, that is true, but what the numbers do not tell you is that if you tweak some settings, you are able to get 90 fps on that resolution with path tracing with no problem.",Neutral
Intel,I feel like the 4k resolution is here to stay for a couple years boys. Get yourself a decent 4k monitor or OLED TV and chill.,Neutral
Intel,"This is why DLSS3 and frame generation are so important. 4x the performance at over 80FPS with a relatively minor amount of silicon dedicated to AI, with only minor visual degradation.",Neutral
Intel,"It's way too early for using ray / path tracing in games comfortably, maybe in 10 years it'll be different, but for the foreseeable future I'm more than happy with normal rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,Who cares tho? Its not even the way it's meant to be ran. This tech is is a synergy. No point in trying to 'flex' native at this point. A 4090 gets very high FPS and amazing visuals when doing things right.,Negative
Intel,can wait in 2030 with the 8030RTX low profile 30 watt card run this game with full path tracing in 4k 120fps lol (in 2030 a low end card will run this like butter don't down vote me because you didn't get it lol),Neutral
Intel,"Seems like this tech is only around to give Nvidia a win. Also path and ray tracing doesn’t always look better. If the one true God card can’t run it, is it reasonable tech or is it a gimmick? Especially seeing how like no one has a 4090. Like a very small percentage of PC gamers have one. Most aren’t even spending $1600 on their whole build!",Negative
Intel,What body part do you think will get me a 5090?,Neutral
Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.  Let's daisy chain 4 4090s ..gets 60 fps.. and then house goes on fire!  Obviously I'm being sarcastic but realistically it's actually pretty sad a 4090 20 frames per second.",Negative

Intel,Lmfao ... where are all those nvidia fan boys who prefer eye-candy path trace over 60fps?,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like some efficient tech. Lmao. What's the fucking point if it makes the game unplayable? RT just washes out the image and looks like shit. Kills the contrast. Can't wait for this fad to end,Negative
Intel,In my opinion it's too early for Ray / path tracing it's computationally expensive and if you are using rasterization at ultra settings not only does look nearly identical but it's easier to do the work for the graphics and that gives you more fps...,Negative
Intel,"Rather than having 2-3fps, I would go and see a video of path tracing.",Neutral
Intel,"Does this fact really matter tho? Dlss in cyberpunk is known the look on par or even better than native, frame generation will further smooth it out. I can definitely see the 7900xtx being able to do path tracing at 1440p at least once amd release fsr 3 and better once they release something to now match ray reconstruction which also give a small boost in fps making path tracing even more doable.",Positive
Intel,cool idc i wont play that shit at such shit settings,Negative
Intel,Do we need this BS? Seriously? Gpu’s will end-up costing over 2 grand soon,Negative
Intel,I don't even get the hype around ray tracing most games don't have it and when they do it either makes the game look blurry or isn't noticeable unless you're in a weirdly lit area or looking at a reflection,Negative
Intel,"Am replaying it with a 6950xt and a 7700k(defo bottleneck).  All maxed out(no RT) at 1440p. If I wanted 4k I would have to enable FSR.  Its completely playable imo.   Mostly 50-60fps.  For me RT vs off vs path tracing.   The game doesn't look more real or better, it just looks different.  But ignorance is bliss.",Positive
Intel,This chart is bull. Since when is a RTX 3060 faster than a 3080. Someone needs to seriously question the source of the chart,Negative
Intel,Just goes to prove once again that Raytracing was pushed at least 4-5 gens too early as a pure marketing gimmick by Nvidia,Negative
Intel,"The Tech Power Up article says:   >Instead of the in-game benchmark we used our own test scene that's within the Phantom Liberty expansion area, to get a proper feel for the hardware requirements of the expansion  So it's very hard to reproduce their data at the moment, but I've run 3 tests with the built in benchmark (run to run variance below 1%, so 3 runs are enough) and my config is averaging 25.7 fps at 4K native with Path Tracing, so the title's premise is not correct. Still, the game is not playable without upscaling at 4K with Path Tracing, so the basis of the sentiment remains correct.

Intel,The first card on this list a normal person would consider buying is a 4070. 8.5 fps lol.   Even with upscaling that's basically unplayable.   Then you have all the UE5 and path trace type demos where a 4090 is only getting 60fps with upscaling.. at 1080p lol.   We are not remotely ready for these technologies yet. They're at least one if not two console generations away. So multiple years.,Negative

Intel,"People have forgotten or are too young to remember when Nvidia had hardware tessellation features when that was first emerging. They had tessellation maps under the ground and water in Crysis that were doing nothing other than tanking AMD (ATi) performance. I am not saying this whole Cyberpunk thing is exactly the same, but it's essentially similar. In all honesty, turning everything up to 11 on my 3090 doesn't net much visual gain beyond some mirror like reflections and nothing I really care about when actually playing the game (compared to standard High/Ultra) and not pixel peeping, which seems to be the new game now for people buying expensive GPUs, so they can justify their purchase. Meanwhile, everyone else just gets on with enjoying video games instead of living vicariously through someone's 4090 at LOL 1080p",Negative

Intel,"Most likely there will be no gpu that supports path tracing and gives you native 4k 120fps in 5 years, maybe even in 10 years.  The technology has slowed down a bit. It’s increasingly more challenging to make more dense chips.  That’s why Intel has been struggling for many years already and every iteration of their cpus gives only minor improvements. AMD went with chiplets but this approach has its own problems.  Nvidia stands out only because of AI. Raw performance increase is still not enough to play native 4k even without ray tracing.",Negative

Intel,But then the current gen games of that era will run like this. The cycle continues,Neutral
Intel,TRUE! i think 5-10 years was the actual point in time where anybody should have paid their hard earned dollar for raytracing gpus. instead ppl dished out $1000s for the RTX2080/Ti and now are sitting on them waiting for raytracing to happen for them xD,Neutral
Intel,Who knows what new tech will be out in even 4 years lol,Neutral
Intel,"And that’s when I’ll turn on this setting in my games. Fuck having to pay $1600 for a sub 30fps experience. Path tracing is far from being a viable option, it’s more like a proof of concept at this point.",Negative

Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Neutral
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Neutral
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative
Intel,"Same card, I just turned off RT at 4K. 75-120fps is better than 40 with muddy but accurate reflections",Neutral
Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral
Intel,"lol. And you missed the 2080Ti.   Every result under 10 fps is just to be ignored, it isn't representing anything outside of ""woot, the card managed to chuck a frame our way"".",Negative

Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Negative
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral

Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Negative

Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Neutral
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Neutral
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Neutral
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Neutral
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral

Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Negative
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Negative
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Neutral
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Neutral
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Negative
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative
Intel,AW2 looks insane. Can't wait to play soon,Positive
Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is.

Intel,My 3080 in shambles,Neutral
Intel,"It looks better than native even with fsr quality, the Taa in this game is shit",Negative
Intel,You dont need to increase raw performance. You need to increase RT performance.,Neutral
Intel,Imagine!,Neutral
Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Neutral
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Positive
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, sure, now go back to play starfield.",Neutral
Intel,"There literally is a /s, what else do you need to detect sarcasm?",Negative
Intel,"Someone made a really cool comment yesterdays on Reddit that even a generated frame using path tracing is less fake than a rasterized frame. It is effectively closer to reference truth. I had never thought about it that way, but people really are clutching their pearls with this shit",Negative

Intel,haha this is gold 🥇,Neutral
Intel,"At the moment, it’s definitely what it seems like.  Especially seeing how there’s only one card on the planet that can run this. Do you have a 4090?",Neutral
Intel,">I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage.  Not at all, in fact another AAA game with ""path tracing"" is coming out next month.  >The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native  Forget ""native"", that ship has already sailed. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are all working on machine learning techniques, and several game developers are starting to optimize their games around DLSS/FSR.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, not even close.  Shaders 3.0 - that's improvement. Ray tracing is noticeable, but nowhere near to justify the hit.  I've looked techpowerup comparison RT vs LOW (lol). Low looked far better and cleaner, then blurry mess of RT (Overdrive).   I don't need ""realistic"" lighting, I need pleasent bisual part with good gameplay. For ghraphics I have a window in my appartment.",Neutral
Intel,"In a screenshot, sure. When actually playing the game, unless the fps is low enough to remind them, 99,99% of people will forget if they left it on or not.",Negative
Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative
Intel,Man you had to lap your q9300 to hit 3.0ghz? Those chips really weren't OC friendly.  My q6600 hummed along 3.2 no problem on 92mm arctic freezer and a slight voltage bump.  I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.,Positive
Intel,Funnily Crysis still have better destructible environments than Cyberpunk has tho,Positive
Intel,"This. People losing their shit either weren't around when Crysis launched or have forgotten just how demanding it was . PT CP kicks the shit out of a 4090, Crysis murdered my 8800ultra.",Negative
Intel,crysis did not do 1080p 60 on maximum setting and dx10 on a 8800GT.   I had a 1280*1024 monitor back then and barely had 30 fps with my 8800GT.   Even the 8800 Ultra did not do 60 fps on full hd.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=46j6fDkMq9I,Negative
Intel,"Man, I remember how hype the 8800gt was. Thing was a hell of a big jump compared to previous cards that came out, prolly our first REALLY powerful card.  Still remember the old xplay video where they build a PC to play crysis and Bioshock. Put 2 8800GTs in sli in there with a core 2 quad which costed one thousand dollars back then!",Positive
Intel,"My poor HD 4850 got pushed to the limit to give me 1280x1024, lol",Negative
Intel,I remember thinking $300-400 (IIRC) was so much for a GPU back around those days.  7800XT is the closest we've seen in a while and not even close to the top end for today.,Negative
Intel,This is still the case to this day because the game includes a really old DLL file for PhysX. The other day I followed the instructions on the PCGamingWiki to delete some DLL files in the game directory and only then it ran perfectly smooth on my RTX 3070.,Neutral
Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Neutral
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens. Sadly an Nvidia GPU is still required if you want to turn PhysX effects on for games from that era, though I hear that it's possible again to use it with an AMD GPU as primary.",Negative
Intel,"OMG I had the exact same experience, hahaha I remember it vividly, I was so confused why that room would just destroy my FPS until I figured out PhysX was enabled LOL",Negative

Intel,What gpu you have,Neutral
Intel,Now it even runs fine on a Ryzen 2400G.,Positive
Intel,"And they were right, PhysX and systems very much like it are still used but things have advanced so much nobody even thinks about it and it no longer requires dedicated silicon.",Neutral

Intel,Ah good old Ageia before nvidia bought them out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageia,Neutral
Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative
Intel,Intel design will be a little bit different as far as now.  If I understood it right AMD chiplets communicate via lines on pcb but Intel wants to make something like chip-on-a-chip.,Neutral

Intel,"There is a lot of room for improvement, both in the software and future generations of hardware.  It's coming along though!  Overdrive mode looks nice, but there's just a lot more ghosting than the regular RT mode.",Positive
Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative
Intel,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,Positive
Intel,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, better graphics costs performance. SHOCKING",Positive
Intel,People do it!,Neutral
Intel,It’s not way slower. I get 110 FPS at 4k with all DLSS settings turned on and honestly it’s insane.,Negative

Intel,"PT looks way better in the game to me - it makes everything in the environment have a more natural look to it.  It adds, not ruins it...",Positive
Intel,"That's how I feel as well. It looks awesome don't get me wrong, but it doesn't look like cyberpunk to me.",Negative
Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, Alan Wake 2 is also releasing with path tracing so my guess is we're definitely gonna see more games featuring heavier RT, although not necessarily path tracing due to the performance hit.",Neutral
Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral
Intel,Raytracing now is a gimmick *  ( * - in AMD sponsored games where RT effects are so tiny you have to zoom on to notice them),Neutral
Intel,"Except this is a tech demo. CP77 has lots of cut corners to achieve that, NN was trained to keep the interface stable in that game and even then, ray reconstruction creates horrible artifacts at some angles and distances. And that's with Ngreedia's engineeers literally sitting at CDPR's office.",Negative
Intel,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,Neutral
Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative
Intel,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,Neutral
Intel,"Don't forget that all NPCs will be controled by AI to simulate a real life.  They'll wake up in the morning, shower, commute to work, work, then go home.  All this to do it over and over and over until they die...  mhhh... this is kinda sad to type out.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)",Negative
Intel,It absolutely is. I’ve been playing at 1440p with DLSS Balanced and Ray Reconstruction and it is absolutely the worst version of DLSS I’ve ever seen. It’s basically unusable.,Negative
Intel,There are horrible artifacts with RR. And ghosting. It replaces artifacts with different ones. Needs a lot more work tbh. Or training.,Neutral
Intel,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",Negative
Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped. Remember using artic solver ceramique instead of as5 due to it potentially not degrading as fast as well.   Good times =)",Negative
Intel,"Yea same here, didn't play crysis until I got a hold of a 260 after having 2 8600gt's in sli. Played mostly wow at the time and those 2 8600gt's in sli got blown away by the gtx 260, but man that card was hot!  Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it.

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090).

In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now. It's something like when you get a high refresh screen and can't look back at 60Hz anymore.",Negative

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance. But, but if a flagship is able to get 4k 60 with path tracing at native then that allows headroom for 60 tier or 70 tier cards to perform well.  In this example the 4090 gets 19.5 fps at 4k. The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful.

Intel,"Yup, ""new Intel"" definitely seems to be getting nicer and with a ""younger"" company culture. Also, it's a smart move.

Intel,"Tell that to anyone that needs CUDA. Or GPU accelerated workloads in general.  Id suck for being able to get something like the 6990 I owned back then, but between lack of support for almost all workloads and the driver being shit since like forever... Nope.  Yes, yes, nvidia's control panel is old and looks like a windows 98 app. But it at least works and actually saves youre settings, unlike AMD's one that half the time simply forget about everything.  I currently own 5 systems. 2 nvidia ones, 3 amd ones. And all of the amd ones had driver related issues.  You can't simply work with that. Is not viable.

Intel,"NVIDIA's highest tier? Nah, but around RTX 4080 is the target, which might be bad news for AMD.",Negative
Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"The Adrenalin overlay is good for really everything except usage. But yeah, this has seemed to have been a problem for a good while now. Ive been using AMD for a little over a year now at least Adrenalin and the CPU usage was always wrong on two different CPUs (AM4 and AM5) as well.

Intel,ah sorry I meant NVK,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know, I didn't downvote you.",Negative
Intel,My point is if you've got nvidia card you simply use 3rd party soft and got everything and more. So comparing that AMD's software to Nvidia's is kind of meaningless.,Neutral
Intel,"I actually agree with you, but I don't need the metric to be some scientifically accurate reading of performance or whatnot, I just think it'd be a useful tool for adjusting game settings. For example, if I'm trying to optimize performance in a game, does this setting make CPU utilization go up or down? How much almost doesn't matter. Is there a bottleneck, where is it, and am I relieving pressure on it with these settings or not?",Neutral
Intel,It’s where you oc in adrenaline,Neutral
Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Neutral
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral

Intel,"We kind of know where it will land. It will be a 3050M level chip, maybe a bit better, but will have improve scaling and frame gen.   8060S is 40 RDNA 3.5 units. One Xe3 unit is about 2.1 RDNA 3.5 units. That put it at about 65% of Strix Halo, though it will have a worse memory bus and no MALL cache. Somewhere in that range.   So that 60% is almost bang on the 3050M. Maybe a bit better. It won’t be like the 4050 but 3050M isn’t bad for an iGPU that fits in a normal socket",Neutral

Intel,"I don’t know how this score compares to the 3050M. I only know that this score is about 55% of the B580. And the B580, at 2K and 4K, is about 1.7–2 times the performance of the desktop 3050",Neutral
Intel,Really don't understand why they don't go with a larger cache.  Pretty sure they still have a bunch of cache chunks spread all around the SoC.,Negative

Also looks like the 3\_8 and 3\_6 versions are differentiating maximum boost clocks, though I wonder if instead those may reflect that configurable upper TDP bound. Might make sense for 65W and 80W to be differentiated if that will coincide with anything about the ""experience-based"" PL1 behavior.",Neutral
Intel,There are 2 dies.  One for professional workload which will be mass produced.  Second is for gaming. Even a 10-12 core xe3 will be barely enough for modern 1080p. Lunarlake can only run alanwake at 1080p at low settings getting only 25 frames so even if this is 50-100% better this is the minimum for a 2026 product.

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.

Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral

Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral

Intel,"Its not ""delusional"" to want to see actual numbers instead of speculation. I have been in this game long enough to see plenty of speculation even with accurate information not give the actual numbers.",Negative
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Neutral

Intel,"To summarize from the article for some folks:  6300 puts this GPU as 33.4% faster than the 140V, 71.3% faster than the 890M, and 54.3% of the 8060S. Just over half of Strix Halo's top config.  Bear in mind though, that this benchmark favors ARC GPUs compared to gaming results. The 140V and 890M are roughly equal and this benchmark puts the 140V as 28.4% faster.",Neutral
Intel,"Ugh, who is naming these products?!?!? Between the internal code names (which are now publicly used) and the actual product names, it's a mess. As bad as monitor naming.",Negative
Intel,"Sick, Panther actually sounds good, and Lunar/Arrow on mobile already sounded good to me. Please keep pumping those iGPU numbers Intel Arc engineer bros.  AutoCAD on integrated Intel graphics WHOOOOOO  AMD step it up next gen please, Intel is no longer a static target in graphics, kthx.",Positive
Intel,This sound more realistic and not as good as the 50% better Intel announced.   For Intels sake I am hoping the 50% is real,Negative
Intel,... with early drivers and probably no decent support yet. Its also probably an engineering sample? 😉,Neutral
Intel,Wow pantherlake is looking enticing. Should I wait for novalake? Will novalake have same battery life like lunar lake or pantherlake?,Positive
Intel,"It's going to cost like $10,000, right?",Neutral

Intel,"It really is a mess, someone should've been fired long ago.",Negative
Intel,"The only thing they want you to care about is 3/5/7/9.  If the naming is too clear, then they can't steer you to the higher margin/profit variants. At some level it needs to be unclear. Not defending them, but how things are.",Negative
Intel,Intel wasn't a static target since the 10th gen. They've been pushing (at least in terms of performance) since then. It's mostly the efficiency which stepped back. And they messed up their current lineup in terms of performance and pricing but they've improved for sure.  Next gen seems good for them though. Hope they price it well. AMD isn't zen 1/2 either. They're bumping core numbers too and introducing some new cores as well.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean, why?  Is AMD going to be coming out with anything more powerful than the HX 370 in that power range?",Neutral
Intel,because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 50% more performance.,Neutral
Intel,"There are so many variables here that we have no way of accurately saying that.  It's possible that Xe3 is simply treated more like RDNA in this benchmark, and that the Xe2 140V is unfairly biased towards in that way. If that is the case, the 890M and 8060S may be better metrics to base off, and we do see over 50% gains for a 50% wider GPU than the 890M.  It's also possible this is a power-limited scenario. Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.  This could be pre-release drivers not getting the true 100% out of the hardware or silicon with non-final clocks still being tuned. The point is there's no way to know for sure.",Neutral
Intel,I don’t understand why you people continue to use that MSI claw to demonstrate “intel improved lunar lake performance post launch” when there are millions of lunar lake laptops that never had performance issue of that one handheld.,Negative
Intel,"they're keeping their jobs because this is technically better than the past. back in the day you'd have model numbers exclusive to a retail store, much less specific to an OEM, because businesses wanted to feel like they got a bespoke deal.   These days the SKU naming is mostly for accounting purposes, while the ""real"" naming decisions are made by the OEMs. basically most people are buying the Thinkpad/Yoga/ROG ""brand"" rather than the specific processor model, which only a much smaller crowd bothers to comprehend. It's like how people buy the Steamdeck rather than whatever APU is in there, which is fairly old at this point.",Neutral
Intel,"Energy efficiency is huge in mobile but I was explicit in saying they were no longer a static target in graphics, where they were not making significant or impressive gains in iGPUs for many years, it seemed. Now they are making one of the best iGPUs on the market.",Positive
Intel,"Possibly yes.   Current AMD handheld chips are better than Lunar Lake performance. Assuming normal cadence. Next generation would be similar performance to Panther Lake.     I was hoping more of a leap frog, rather than similar performance. %50 would be a very clear edge.",Positive
Intel,Is the TDP fixed to be the same between LL and PTL in this test?  I genuinely don't know.,Neutral
Intel,But LNL's TDP is too low compared to H45 cpu,Neutral

Intel,FTFY: because 50% more cores need 50% more power for 35-40% more performance.  Cause it don't scale linearly.,Neutral
Intel,"Mostly because people with LNL laptops are less likely to games since gaming are not the point of those laptops -> less testing, whereas the Claw 8 AI+ is a gaming PC handheld, so it is mostly use for gaming purpose and thus have more people testing for its performance.",Neutral
Intel,"As weird as it sounds actually Lunar Lake improvement mainly comes from MSI Claw not laptop, that because majority people who use MSI Claw give feedback the most which is why Intel focusing on the handheld first then laptop.    Intel even use Claw as benchmark for Lunar Lake compared to laptop. You can read from this article :  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/   Also Claw got BIOS update way faster than any laptop with the same chip so it helps Intel to mitigate power and boost behavior to maximize the performance. There is so many bug reports on Arc forum, most of them are Claw users, that's why laptop got benefits too.",Positive
Intel,AMD isn’t coming out with a better next gen iGPU for mobile (Gorgon Point) since it’s a simple refresh. Same arch with same CU count based on rumors.  The generation after will be competing with Nova Lake,Neutral
Intel,"Amd handheld with Z2E isn't better than Intel Lunar Lake, you can see the comparison on MSI Claw sub or even on youtube. Z2E in most game is 10% slower than Core Ultra 7 258V, it only won in the game where Intel GPU performs bad.    Not to mention at 17w Z2E losing badly to 258V, Intel is on their own league, it's not even competition for Amd.",Negative
Intel,Intel is gonna have better integrated graphics than AMD,Positive
Intel,I have no idea.,Neutral
Intel,"We don't know what TDP was run here, and both MTL amd ARL H have been 28W outside of the Ultra 9 SKUs. It's entirely possible this was run at 28W, which is also in reach of Lunar Lake's boost envelope.",Neutral
Intel,The lunar lake laptops are tested by reviewers all the same as the strix point ones. Regardless it’s misleading because it’s not “lunar lake” but rather the performance profile/boost behaviour of that specific MSI CLAW that was changed and people act like it’s lunar lake’s drivers doing “30% magic”.   It’s not.,Negative
Intel,"And is there documented so-called “large” performance improvements on LNL systems that already performed as expected on day one (it tied 890m on high power and was always better at low power, talking about real games not 3dmark)? Or was it only bringing the Claw back to where LNL should always perform?",Neutral
Intel,"True. I don't see how the next igpu from Amd going to use rdna 4, it won't even support fsr 4. Meanwhile Intel going to push their igpu tech even further with XeSS XMX 3 with Xe3 and Xe3P, they will be way ahead of Amd in igpu market especially when Intel Lunar Lake already beating Amd Strix Point and Z2E.

Intel,"When is the panther lake reveal going to be, CES?",Neutral
Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral
Intel,Wonder if there's some energy star requirements.,Neutral
Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal. Both frequency and sequential optimizations (like multi-level branch prediction) scale poorly.  Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though. So seeing the benefits to E cores for gaming requires 1.) e-cores exist for a while 2.) some games optimize for them.  Long term, an optimal Intel-style processor design will look something like 4 ""legacy"" P cores + dozens of E cores.",Neutral
Intel,It's either N3P or 18AP.,Neutral
Intel,That’s why rumors want Intel to throw away P-cores (Israel team) and only keep E-cores (Austin) to make Titan lake a unified core with only E-cores remaining.,Neutral
Intel,>and games are getting more multithreaded.  Can you give me a few AAA examples of modern games which get a noticeable improvement in AVG. FPS or 0.1/1% lows when using more than 8cores/16 thread's ? I'm genuinely curious which games you are talking about.,Neutral
Intel,"Really should focus on the Main/Sub thread part. Most games will usually only load up 1-3 cores, with the rest of the cores only used for incidental workloads with lower priority and sync requirements (Multithreading is hard yo, Multithreading with latency requirements is mindnumbing).  This makes plenty of games very suitable for the P/E architecture, as long as you have enough P cores for the Main threads, the E cores will be perfectly sufficient.",Neutral
Intel,"Energy Star probably won't be around for too much longer, at least in it's current form.  https://www.npr.org/2025/08/13/nx-s1-5432617/energy-star-trump-cost-climate-change",Neutral
Intel,That makes me imagine in a different reality if Xbox had remained with Intel and NVIDIA and their next generation would use an Intel E-core based SoC with NVIDIA chiplet.,Neutral
Intel,It has already happened. Stephen Robinson - heading the Austin team - is now the lead x86core architect.,Neutral
Intel,"Off the top of my head, Starfield, Bannerlord, BeamNG, UE5 games due to how the rendering pipeline works, etc.",Neutral
Intel,"Most games of the past will only load up a few cores, but that's beginning to change. Cyberpunk 2.0 loads up 16 threads/cores easily, and some others like Battlefield 6 also scale pretty well. If you have less than 16 threads on fast cores like Panther Lake and Arrow Lake, then you can run into issues. Or if your 16 threads are on one die and any spillover has to go across the SoC die like with AMD and probably Nova Lake.",Neutral
Intel,"Seeing how Nvidia working together with Intel to make integrated high end GPU i can see the possibility of Xbox using that chip, maybe in the future.",Positive
Intel,I'm tired of AMD slop consoles and handhelds,Neutral
Intel,">Starfield  [Not really](https://youtu.be/BcYixjMMHFk?t=1015), game doesn't benefit from more cores/threads.  >Bannerlord  Sadly, there's no benchmarks of different CPUs that I could find for this specific game, but I do know that this game heavily relies on a good CPU, but without decent data(review), which shows multiple CPUs tested, it's hard to understand the benefits of more cores/threads,  >UE5 games due to how the rendering pipeline works  It's true that UE5 can utilize 8 cores / 16 threads, but more than that? I'm not sure, if possible, provide a review/video which shows that UE5 scale with more cores/threads, so far, it seems that it is limited at 8c/16t - big channels rarely add UE5 games to their CPU benchmarks, but I found Remnant 2,[ and it doesn't show any benefits](https://youtu.be/3n537Z7pJug?t=1056) of more than 8 cores.  I heard that ""games are getting more multithreaded"" like 4-5 years ago, and in most cases, it wasn't true, with more than 8c/16t almost no games scale on CPU-side, and even when they do, in most cases it's a minor improvement over 8c/16t configuration, like 1-3%.",Negative
Intel,"UE5 by default does not support multithreading well. actually I don't think async shader is even considered a default feature yet despite being added two years ago. Only the editor compilation step uses all threads, but it doesn't need to react to user input so it would be more surprising if it didn't use all threads.  If you're seeing good thread use in a UE5 game is thanks to the developer breaking up work with their own engine changes.",Negative
Intel,"Considering AMD’s lag in gaming performance especially in ray tracing, I would be totally onboard with that.",Neutral
Intel,Huh????,Neutral
Intel,"12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark, like actually within error margins next to 7800X3D despite being an older platform with half the L2 of raptor lake and lower clock speed than even 7700X, shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much. Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,"To be fair, Sony seems to be fed up with AMD lagging behind and are pushing them to do better. Consoles will likely continue to stick with AMD, at least for the next generation. Intel graphics aren't quite ready yet, and Nvidia is going to be way to expensive unless they take an old SoC and repurpose it like Nintendo.",Neutral
Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive
Intel,"Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X in baldurs gate 3, a highly multithreaded game, it has better 0.1% lows even, though I'm sure that one is a contained incident since BG3 is very dynamic and hence results are not always repeatable. Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral
Intel,">Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X  I said ""can and will"" not that every game is going to benefit from it.  Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

It's not like we have to guess what is what is big and what is coming. We know and what's coming is more AI and more graphical experiences.

Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.  That uses some power and silicon.  3. Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.

AMD,"This is just factually wrong. Look at GPU price history from MSRP to market price for the last year. GPU launches were incredibly inflated until these last 2 months, so what you think is ""black friday deals"" and ""cheap"" is what was supposed to be its original MSRP lol. Now this price hike is just to artificially raise the price to maintain the same profit margins they've had from the past year out of pure greed. No reason for AMD to raise prices on existing products on shelfs except for pure greed. No reason for RAM manufacturers to not offer long term contracts to large customers and OEMs when they are purposely causing a shortage, except for pure greed. No reason for Nvidia (who does not produce a large quantity of their FE GPUs themselves and relies on AIBs) to not bundle Vram with their dyes to the AIBs that have a smaller profit margin than Nvidia, except for pure greed.  20% of this is speculation of a AI bubble pop, the other 80% is companies seeing blood in the water and hopping on the price gouging train to artificially raise the prices for the whole industry. When all the businesses collude and work together to raise the price of computing power, which is now an essential commodity now that it powers the world, who stops them?

You also have to consider what impact generational improvements have on platform longevity. Zen 1 -> Zen 3 was a huge jump. Assuming Zen 7 on AM5, I don't think we're gonna see that level of improvement with Zen 4 -> Zen 7.  Let's say someone upgrades from AM4 to AM5 with the launch of Zen 6. They receive less value from platform longevity than someone who entered at Zen 4. And someone who bought in at Zen 4 will likely receive less value than someone who bought in at Zen 1.

AMD,"Maybe for an experienced builder, but to me (someone who's only built 1 PC) the prospect of just changing the CPU seems like a far less daunting task.  If you just want to replace the CPU, you unscrew 4 screws to remove your cooler/AIO pump head, pop open the socket, put your new CPU in, repaste and remount the cooler, plug some fans back in if necessary, and you're good. Maybe remove the GPU if you're really pressed for space.  When changing an entire motherboard, you have to unmount the cooler, remove the GPU, unplug every cable plugged into the motherboard, possibly remove some AIO fans/the radiator (or just fans in general) from the case if they're getting in the way of the motherboard screws, remove the motherboard, and remove any SSDs you want to reuse.   Then you have to put everything (CPU, SSDs, RAM) on the new motherboard, put the new motherboard in, repaste and remount the cooler, remount any fans you had to take off and plug them back into the motherboard, plug all your PSU cables again, then put your GPU back into place.  You basically have to redo a big chunk of the entire build process. Not to invalidate what you said, maybe you are proficient enough that all that would only take you 10 additional minutes. But I would not bank on the average DIY PC owner being able to do all that so quickly.",Neutral

I also remember when I was a young teenager I got a bad board from Frys in the late 90s. My friend also received an Asrock board a few months into 2025 that basically melted with stock settings.

By the time the prices have started rising its too late.  If a gpu is available at msrp at launch you can rarely find better value later in the gen as prices dont drop anymore until the next gen. So yeah either buy at launch and msrp or wait for the next cycle   Imo if you are on a complete potato gpu now and need a cheap upgrade then second hand 3060ti are very cheap (190 euros) , else a 5070ti is the only thing id consider to have any performance/price right now. Everything else is either way more expensive for little gain, or has too little vram for the price.

There used to be a general idea for buying hardware, *Just buy it when you need it, there is always the next big thing coming*, which still is in part true, but man with the volatility of the market since Corona Im 100% certain you can time your buys.",Negative
AMD,so you got it for two thirds the price it actually costs?,Neutral
AMD,Gotta redo your skill tree but it can get boring pretty easy without the right setup,Neutral
AMD,r/outside is leaking,Neutral
AMD,"Could be a pretty massive difference. Each AIB fighting to source memory on individual smaller contracts instead of NVIDIA just making one big deal for the entire production run, taking advantage of the scale to get it cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,Sure they are expanding GDDR7.  But for servers mostly.  RTX 6000 Pro Blackwell (96GB GDDR7) is a hot server GPU for inference use cases that aren't just the giant LLMs.  It is much more cost efficient than the B200 HBM offerings for all sorts of use cases that don't need to access too much RAM concurrently.  Several NVidia competitor hopefuls have also gone the GDDR route for inference focused AI accelerators.,Neutral
AMD,They're already sacrificing margins on making consumer GPUs instead of AI GPUs,Negative
AMD,"There are rumors that Nvidia will no longer be bundling VRAM with their GPUs in the face of rising memory prices, and AIBs will have to source it on their own.  While Nvidia may be ""absorbing costs"" on their FE models which have very limited production, for the vast majority of consumer graphics cards they're going to be passing on costs to the AIBs and thus consumers.   They have absolutely no incentive to absorb costs, anyway. Their entire consumer gaming graphics division is already being run at a massive opportunity cost to their real money maker, datacenter GPUs. It's frankly a miracle that they haven't decided to entirely scrap it yet when the same dies they're selling to consumers for a few grand at most can be sold to AI datacenters for tens of thousands.",Neutral
AMD,"\> absorb the costs if they desire  What makes you think they desire? They have a massive fraction of the market, and from a profit/investor POV raising prices is win/win here unless it somehow risks significant market share loss.",Neutral
AMD,"Agreed.  I’m just sort of surprised they would absorb the cost at all, tbh.",Neutral
AMD,>Nvidia has much better margins on gaming GPUs so they can absolutely absorb the costs if they desire.  Which won't happen. Nvidia doesn't want to be a charity.,Neutral
AMD,"True, and I recommend people get cards based on their needs/desires, never blanket recommend 1 company over the other.  I’m just surprised it’s AMD who might raise prices before Nvidia, even if they can absorb some of the cost.",Negative
AMD,That's only a rumor and has not been confirmed.,Neutral
AMD,"Why are AMD's margins slimmer?  They're manufacturing at the same place using very similar technology. Their equivalent product is actually a little smaller than Nvidia's in terms of die size... they're a big TSMC customer, while obviously not as big as Nvidia they're not some small timer who can't negotiate a favourable deal either.  On this basis I would assume AMD and Nvidia have very similar margins on GPU sales to board partners.",Neutral
AMD,then why are AMD cards more expensive?,Negative
AMD,Still seeing $579.,Neutral
AMD,"When you've been there for 20 years and kept losing market share in the last decade continuously, you are in deep problem. But for AMD, right now they prefer being the SOC for gaming and have little interest in putting effort in dGPUs.",Negative
AMD,"I doubt Nvidia will raise prices they will most likely just stop producing FE""s. Which isn't the same as eating the cost or raising it.   Then AIB's will most likely raise pricing. That isn't due to Nvidia thats AIB's doing what they gotta do.   As far as priority gaming has never been the priority for Nvidia this generation. There priority is AI chips. Everything else is secondary to that.   AMD CPU division is basically printing money now. They want there GPU division to go anywhere. There going to need to be more competitive, right now there not.   They don't offer a better software stack, Ray tracing or anything to match the 5080 in performance. They also have a reputation of dropping support a LOT sooner then Nvidia  That means they need to become a value leader and why in the world would you pay the same or more for a 9700xt over a 5070 Ti?   Specially if the two are with in 50 dollars of each other or even 100 dollars of each other.",Negative
AMD,"Whelp if that rumors become the truth, then it is definitely right to expect the Nvidia GPUs will also get a price increase, i just wonder when it will happen and why AMD did it first with their RDNA 4...",Neutral
AMD,"Usually it's best not to buy during the post-launch rush when prices are way inflated, unless one can get one of the few actual MSRP offers.  Other than that, I totally agree that trying to predict the future is largely futile. Especially now that generational improvements have become so slow and low. Hardware holds its value for longer than ever before and the risk of buying a product only to see it depreciate it soon after is therefore also low.  People who bought any decently reviewed GPU at MSRP since the RTX 20-series have gotten pretty good value by now.",Negative
AMD,"9070 xt shouldn't be too bad either, considering it can be had for less than $/€600. Unless you're a big fan of AI upscaling.  Waiting for delivery now, I guess the shop has a bit of backlog after BF/CM.",Positive
AMD,Either way the days of the affordable 200-300$ value king are long gone.  Anomalies like the Nvidia 8800GT or the 1080 Ti will never happen ever again.,Negative
AMD,>95% will never use it  And the other 5% could use 4 or 100? Or is the XTX too cheap for that?,Negative
AMD,"Sure, but how often can you predict something will drop that much? When the 5090 was announced didn't people sell their 4090s for as much as they bought them or slightly more? Also, if I'm going to use a GPU for 3 months, I'm not going to wait for it to drop in price.",Neutral
AMD,"I like to buy every other year now, while my current GPU still holds some value.   GTX 970 -> 980 Ti -> 1080 -> RTX 2070 Super -> 3080 -> RX 9070 XT",Positive
AMD,Brand new in the EU I’ve seen them go brand new for as little as €609 actually. He had it listed for €540 but I managed to haggle it down to €500. So roughly €100-€110 off MSRP?,Neutral
AMD,and proper setups cost quite a bit too.,Neutral
AMD,"Also means there's probably going to be a lot more variability in performance from vendor to vendor than we're used to, due to the sourcing of VRAM potentially being from different places.",Neutral
AMD,They have 92% of the gaming sector. It's easy money and a failsafe if the AI bubble goes bust.,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia is also likely in a position where can get better prices on memory than AMD. So they might not be facing reduced margins yet.,Neutral
AMD,Im surprised that people even consider AMD its not priced well against Nvidia and Intel is coming hot on its heels. Their attitude towards consumers is frankly appalling considering that they are just fighting for scraps in this space,Negative
AMD,"Why is it ok to talk about AMD rumors but not NVidia ones?  The seemingly official quote in this article is clearly at least partially wrong:  It states no new products through 2027.  Do you really believe AMD won't be producing any new GPU SKUs for over 2 years?  I think in both cases these rumors are likely true, but may be a bit off given that both are sloppy third hand leaks without any confirmation from the source or quality multiple sources.",Negative
AMD,A 9070 XT's die is almost as large as a 5080 but are selling it for far less. Also nvidia is doubt able to just get a better price on components.,Neutral
AMD,"They have far lower market share, they most likely price their stuff with a lower margin. Nvidia can do whatever they want.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia has a 378 mm2 GPU that has a MSRP of $1000 and $750, while AMD for the same die size has $550 and $600 MSRP. In this case, nvidia makes between 50-80% more $$$ per die.  Nvidia has a 260 mm2 GPU has that a MSRP of $550, while AMD has a 200 mm2 for $300 and $350.  And so on....  A wafer of chips produced at TSMC generates nvidia much more money that AMD's one, even though the prices per wafer must be similar.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9070 XT is priced closer to an RTX 5070 right now, performs like a 5070 Ti but is much closer in terms of hardware to an RTX 5080. So while AMD does use similar manufacturing, they have to price lower than Nvidia for roughly the same hardware (similar GPU die size, 256-bit VRAM bus with 16GB of VRAM).",Neutral
AMD,RDN4 is on a more expensive and smaller node.,Neutral
AMD,"Their market share just went up, not down. But it's not where it should be, I'm just happy they have success in the DIY/enthusiast market, since that's where I am. I don't care much about the OEM or laptop markets.",Positive
AMD,Nvidia has about $50 billion more cash on hand to stretch it out and not be a first mover if they wish.,Neutral
AMD,"Apple has insanely good CPU hardware. But they have zero value, because it comes tied to a mac, so thats an automatic nonstarter for most.",Positive
AMD,"Macbook Air M4 is $750 most of the time now and there's no Windows laptop at the price that can compete on build quality, battery and experience, if you don't plan on doing any laptop gaming.",Negative
AMD,Unless the AI bubble pops and chipmakers find themselves sitting on a huge pile of chips that they can't sell.,Neutral
AMD,"The usual trick is to list it as a business expense and claim the VAT back, but it wouldn't knock more than 5% off the price, else there'd be no profit for the seller.  It was either used or fallen off a truck.  Legit brand new was €589 in Germany around BF and CM.",Neutral
AMD,>It's easy money and a failsafe ~~if~~ when the AI bubble goes bust.  FTFY,Neutral
AMD,Google’s TPUs are already showing a lot of promise and its been used to train the best AI model currently,Positive
AMD,I switched to AMD mainly because of Nvidias shit drivers on Linux. Which is funny because I had previously switched to Nvidia because of AMDs shit drivers on Windows.,Negative
AMD,"Not everyone lives in the USA.  In my country it's priced competitively with a 150€ price difference to the 5070 Ti.  If you don't care about the RT difference and CUDA, going with AMD is a no brainer",Neutral
AMD,"The 5080 die is the same one as the 5070 ti, which is the direct competitor of the 9070xt and sells more than the 5080. Average margins will be slightly higher for Nvidia, but not by much. Especially considering AMD uses GDDR6.",Neutral
AMD,GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah, I was comparing 9070XT to 5070Ti.  They're all remarkably small dies but I guess that's progress.",Neutral
AMD,"Certainly NVidia has notably higher margins here, but you're likely over estimating it somewhat.  GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost.   The overall board cost is also influenced by cooling and complexity of the board traces / power circuitry (though, not by that much).    Additionally, Its not clear how much of the actual sale (vs MSRP) NVIdia earns vs AMD -- there are various people making profit between them and the consumer.  We also know that NVidia sells the vast majority of its gaming GPUs not directly to consumers but to OEMs for pre-builds.  We don't know if NVidia sells GPUs to those OEMs at the same price they sell to D2C retail brands.  Do the big OEM system builders (NVidia's largest customers) get bulk discounts others do not?",Neutral
AMD,Oh they're about £100 or more different in price where I am.,Neutral
AMD,Yearly it went down.,Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn’t put it past people doing that but there are plenty of used 9070 XT’s in Europe selling for under €550 on some sites, just seen one sell for €530 a few hours ago and another for €550. Not uncommon.",Neutral
AMD,outside of US AMD is way too expensive to even consider for a GPU.,Negative
AMD,I dont also live in the USA. 150 pricce difference with no guarantee when they will cut first day game driver updates. Please id rather spend that extra 150 and get better support lol.,Negative
AMD,">GDDR6 and GDDR7 do not have the same cost. The overall board cost is also influenced by cooling and complexity of the board traces / power circuitry (though, not by that much).  Hope you're not trying to say that GDDR7 is responsible for the increase of $400 of board costs. Come on! A little research showed that there's just a difference of $2-3 per GB, which comes around **$30-50 for 16GB**. Please don't try to say the PCB circuitry is $300 because PCB's is one of the cheapest components of a GPU.  LE: You say the costs are influenced by cooling. FYI, the TDP increase for 5080 vs 9070 is just 45W (350W vs 304W). That's $10 **max** in cooler costs if you've been closely following the BOM cots for the industry.",Neutral
AMD,"That doesn't mean AMD isn't selling well, it can mean that Nvidia happens to sell even better. But mostly in the OEM and laptop market, not the DIY and enthusiast market that interest us.  The 9070 XT is the best selling video card on Amazon in the US and in Europe. And the best selling card on Mindfactory and various price aggregators. So it's actually looking pretty good for AMD, the 9000 series is a pretty big success.",Positive

If he can buy up 40% of the DRAM supply he thinks he can stop his competition from being able to source ram at reasonable prices.

AMD,"> Of course the impressive part is getting the driver running in modern Windows.  Shouldn't be that hard since, simply put, PCi-Express not only is just a newer revision of PCI itself (technically speaking), but also from a information-technology standpoint it's basically fairly the same.  Since to this day, all x86-chipsets still have a *PCI-to-PCi-Express* bridge and would be physically able to house age-old PCI-slots, if boards *wouldn't* have essentially beheaded the chipset off its physical PCI-slots …  *Microsoft didn't had Windows fundamentally drop support for PCI-slots nor -cards, or did they?*  ---- For comparison on what today's chipsets are actually capable of, just take a sharp look at recent Xeon- or EPYC-boards for embedded industrial PCs — They still often offer lots of PCI-slots, PS\/2 and whatnot.  So PCI, PCI-X and PCi-Express are more or less interchangeable and absolutely being concurrently featured onto boards *all at the same time*, even alongside some AGP-slot.

Also almost broke young Jensen back then was basically running around frantically (to one investor after another, begging for millions) after some on-going law-suits (at which nVidia rightfully got dealt severe blows over stolen technology and patent-infringement from 3Dfx), only to get together the money to overtake 3Dfx and essentially nip all the legal process-proceedings hammering in over Jensen in the bud …   … by overtaking 3Dfx, which at that point back then was going bankrupt in mere months (with the law-suits with Nvidia having very much to do with it to begin with …), only to  thus clear all legal dust for nVidia altogether.  ---- If nVidia **wouldn't** have been able to get together the money for a ~~de facto-settlement~~ *hostile overtake* of 3Dfx, nVidia *wouldn't* exist today.

AMD,"There were a lot of factors, but 3dfx made a lot of bad decisions and Nvidia didn't. The original Voodoo was wildly successful at a time where Nvidia had just suffered a massive failure with their own first GPU, the NV1, which mostly tanked because it had compatibility issues with Microsoft's graphics API, DirectX3D. Instead of releasing a new card, 3dfx got stuck while Nvidia released their next card, the RIVA 128 (NV3, since NV2 was an abandoned chip for the Dreamcast). Importantly, this card embraced D3D.   Nvidia was also indeed pushing new features, beating 3dfx with 32 bit color on the TNT (NV4) while the Voodoo 1-3 were 16 bit. By the time the 256 (NV10) came out, games were moving firmly to 3D and Nvidia had both strongly developed features *and* way better performance at this point. The 256 is often considered the first true GPU because it introduced hardware transform and lighting, and thus the modern concept of a unified GPU architecture; earlier GPUs were ""accelerators"" and had to rely heavily on the CPU for things like geometry and lighting.   3dfx was also pushing a proprietary API, Glide, whereas Nvidia and ATI supported D3D and OpenGL which developers were more willing to work with. Nvidia was, in general, very cooperative with the market on both ends.   Now, around the time 3dfx was failing, ATI was making big improvements -- they also had 32 bit color and hardware T&L shortly after Nvidia.",Neutral

Or you'll have both, but the image will be 8 bit (HDMI 2.0 levels with 8 bit 4:2:0), causing colour issues. Or the image will straight up bug out/break/disconnect.  The Cable Matters is the only adapter the community has found which can do all the above somewhat reliably. The adapater is at its fucking limit, so sometimes it bugs out, needing to be unplugged/plugged in, or a restart; but in my experience I get 4K 120Hz HDR with VRR at 10bit most of the time. I use Bazzite on an LG C1 TV with an AMD 7900XT.  I would consider the experience absolutely usable and not a dealbreaker. It just works most of the time. I just have to unplug it and plug it back in, or restart my console PC under the TV a couple times a month.  Now we wouldn't need that adapter if the HDMI Forum allowed HDMI 2.1 on Linux without proprietary drivers (which AMD do not have). And unfortunately HDMI has a monopoly on TVs, so we're stuck with either HDMI 2.0 (which is open source on linux, but looks like shit with HDR and VRR enabled due to 8bit 4:2:0), or using a janky ass adapter to use HDMI's more reasonable competitor - Displayport.",Neutral
AMD,"No, because the underlying spec is DisplayPort, and it's converting to HDMI signaling.  It doesn't add features that DisplayPort lacks, unfortunately - DP to HDMI is generally a one-way connection, so anything coming back over HDMI will be lost.",Negative
AMD,"I'll let someone else answer that, because I've only used Arc cards on Linux servers for compute/Quicksync. I've never used the video output on them.  From what I understand about Arc (and what someone seems to have commented under me too), they do not have actual HDMI hardware, just a DP -> HDMI converter built into the card itself. This should bypass the issue entirely.",Neutral
AMD,"ARC is between your TV and your receiver (HDMI to HDMI). Assuming you're using the adapter from your PC to your TV (Displayport to HDMI), you should be fine. The video card will still send audio.",Neutral
AMD,"TVs with DP support are incredibly rare, right?",Neutral
AMD,"From reading forum posts, it's flaky. So it's a crapshoot regardless.",Neutral
AMD,"The open source Nvidia driver ""works"" because it is modular. The part that the HDMI Forum refuses to open source is separate and proprietary.  Intel Arc skips the problem entirely afaik by having the DP -> HDMI converter on board the card itself. Intel Arc cards don't actually have HDMI, just a converted Displayport.  So you could use Nvidia on Linux. But then you'd have to deal with the plethora of Nvidia-specific issues on Linux: lower FPS than Windows, bad frame times, low 1% lows, bad Wayland support, no Gamescope support, etc... It's usable and mostly works if you don't look at the numbers. But when a 9070XT catches up to a 5090 in averages on Linux, and beats it in 1% lows, you know something's wrong.  About your second point, sure it's ideological in the sense that AMD decided a decade ago to make their Linux drivers open source, and part of the Linux Kernel itself. (AMD users on Linux do not update drivers, they just update the Kernel. Nvidia users have to install separate drivers like Windows). And they're paying for that (otherwise good decision) today.  But the problem in reality is practical, because it means that AMD would have to rewrite their entire driver architecture for Linux because one pesky organisation refuses to give an inch.  It's absurd to blame AMD driver design which has always been the best Linux GPU experience, when it's one organisation refusing to budge an inch and asking AMD to reinvent the wheel instead. The worst part is the HDMI 2.1 firmware isn't black magic. There's no trademark secret here that risks being exposed; let alone capabilities which Displayport doesn't already have. They're litterally just being asses about it.",Neutral
AMD,"No it's NOT that straightforward. Nvidia and AMD have very different GPU architectures. Nvidia has the GSP which offloads a lot of hardware management from the OS, including apparently HDMI-related functionality. The GSP is essentially an entire sub-OS that runs on the GPU that is launched via firmware provided by the OS. This has several benefits such as being separated from the OS so that they can have the OS-specific driver side be simpler with a shared GSP firmware. It also can help reduce load on the system CPU since many tasks are being handled directly on the GPU instead of needing to run on the CPU. And also what is probably the most important reason to Nvidia that it allows them to ""lock"" features in a way where someone can't hack the driver to unlock them (their consumer GPUs basically have all the same hardware as their enterprise ones but the consumer ones have severe limits because they want companies to buy their more expensive ones). The con of it is that it makes the GPUs slightly more expensive (pennies compared to what they get by forcing companies to buy enterprise GPUs instead) and that the firmware blobs are very large because they're essentially an entire minimal OS image.  By contrast the AMD GPUs have much simpler firmware components and delegate much of what the GSP does to the driver. This is cheaper for them but it means that they have to write the functionality multiple times for the OSs they support and they have no real mechanism to prevent people from buying their cheaper consumer GPUs instead of their more expensive ones (besides the latter having more memory and being under a support contract).",Neutral
AMD,"Not quite sure of the full details, but essentially it boils down to NVIDIA doing things differently.  They have a closed source firmware blob that handles most low level card functionality unlike AMD and Intel, and thus they can offer HDMI 2.1 functionality by not having that functionality as part of the driver itself, but rather handled by the firmware.",Neutral
AMD,Bastards,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, this is the crux of the issue  `amdgpu` is fully open-source. The HDMI forum refuses to allow AMD to put support there because of their approach to their ""intellectual property"" of how HDMI 2.1 works.  Theoretically, a binary-only module could include support, but that's not a good approach either  If one were to make hardware-specific (GabeCube/SteamDeck only) support in software, it would still expose the implementation details, and would be trivial to bypass.  As I understand it, Intel ARC has HDMI2.1 in Linux by implementing it in hardware, so if anything, Valve could maybe take that approach with a built-in DP->HDMI converter for instance.",Negative

AMD,Not insanity. Dickhead behaviour.,Neutral
AMD,"I totally agree, but wish GPUs would have mini-DP and at least one USB-C with DP-Alt.  They take less space so allow more exhaust vent.  Also, it will be easier to get TVs manufacturers to adopt USB-C (which is doing DP) because they cater to the average consumer.",Neutral

AMD,And many TVs use eARC to get the audio from their tv smart apps and streaming boxes to their speakers.   And if not you’d use the pass throughs on your amp which are hdmi because it has audio.   DisplayPort just doesn’t do the things needed for home theatre use.,Neutral
AMD,Damn I do believe I use eARC or maybe it was CEC and I use optical for audio. It'd be nice to have HDMI and eARC then,Neutral
AMD,You don’t need eARC on the HDMI if you have a dedicated optical cable going from your TV to your AVR.,Neutral
AMD,Display port over TB does.  you have lots of extra bandwidth options here.,Neutral

AMD,"We have had very few changes in the industry in recent decades, even for cables.    Having an optical base standard wouldn’t change anything from this point.

AMD,"when it comes to  VRR to HDMI though DP, literally every company has issues with it.",Negative
AMD,"I mean...the use-case is a bit different.  I don't think the average person is connecting an Intel Arc GPU to a TV and the average person buying one, is probably more willing to troubleshoot or find solutions.

If you're having every day normal, mainstream customers troubleshoot why HDMI isn't working on their Steam Machine, then you've lost the battle before it even started. Those customers aren't going to turn to Google to figure out why its not working. They are just going to ask for a refund and stick with conventional consoles.",Neutral

AMD,"Yup from gpu to TV and the sound bar is hooked up to the arc hdmi on the TV. Also keep forgetting my soundbar is arc, not eArc.",Neutral
AMD,"It's not really about the driver itself being modular with Nvidia, but the fact that the kernel driver doesn't actually do any low level management of the card at all. Instead, the card has a processor on it (called the GSP) which manages all the functionality of the card. That's why the firmware is like 100MB; it's basically an entire driver. The OS kernel driver just tells the GSP what it wants to do and the GSP takes care of the implementation details. AMD and Intel can't do the same thing with their cards and it would require a complete rework of how the cards/GPUs are designed. It's also why Nvidia's Linux kernel driver is now open-source; any trade secrets and implementation details about their cards are part of the firmware, which is closed source.",Neutral
AMD,">It also can help reduce load on the system CPU since many tasks are being handled directly on the GPU instead of needing to run on the CPU.  I'm not terribly knowledgeable on the subject, but it does appear as though this statement flies in the face of all the disparity between AMD and NV GPUs running (in Windows) on low perf CPUs. Hardware Unboxed did several videos showing that overall driver CPU overhead was notable higher on NV.",Neutral
AMD,"Which is why I'm not sure framing this entirely as an issue with the HDMI forum is accurate.   Yes one might not like the stance from an ideological perspective. But it does seem technically speaking it's possible to implement HDMI 2.1 on Linux. There is no hard restriction.  So if AMD or Valve chose not to implement it just based on that, should the consumer who might not share such rigid ideological stances also not pressure AMD or Valve to take a more pragmatic approach?",Neutral
AMD,"> Valve could maybe take that approach with a built-in DP->HDMI converter for instance.  Only problem is I’m pretty sure the Steam Machine would be hardware final already, so the only chance Valve has is convincing the HDMI Forum to allow support in the open source driver, which AMD already tried to do and failed.",Neutral

AMD,"well, its becasue they don't wangt HDMI to be open source, and by nature a linux implememntation will bascially be open source.",Neutral
AMD,"The issues aren't really as visible on a smaller scale. Displayport was my preferred format until I had to deal with it on a large scale.   Perhaps a quarter of the PCs at my job have displayport as their only video output. Those DP cables make up over 90% of the display cables we have to replace. When we had significant amounts of VGA / DVI those basically never died even when they got beat up badly by the users. HDMI isn't quite on that level, but they mostly only die from users smooshing their PCs against the wall and bending the hell out of the cable ends. I replace a dead HDMI cable maybe once every couple months due to this.  Our DisplayPort cables never get beat up due to the PCs associated with them being under counters in a spot where users have no reason to move them around, but despite this they die like crazy. We replace maybe three or four a month. We've tried a variety of brands including Cable Matters, because we'd really like to stop dealing with this. No dice.",Negative

AMD,"Unfortunately, yes, if you can't use DisplayPort from your PC to your monitor.",Negative
AMD,"Ah I see! Honestly no clue since my sound system still uses Toslink (optical)! So for me the audio output is baked into the video feed with HDMI from the PC, and the TV just outputs that over Toslink.  Although I'm interested in the answer too, since I wanted to upgrade to an eARC setup one day.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, adapter should work fine. 👍",Positive
AMD,"Just because the Nvidia driver is offloading more tasks to the GPU it does not mean that it uses less CPU than the AMD GPU. It just means that the Nvidia driver would be using more CPU compared to not doing so, but at the end of the day the hardware is different and the drivers are completely different implementations. Perhaps the AMD driver is in fact more efficiently written than the Nvidia one or perhaps the Nvidia driver is doing something else that the AMD driver isn't.   Without actually profiling what the driver is doing while it's scheduled on the CPU you'd have no real way to know the reason and even if you had profiles of both the AMD and Nvidia drivers they'd be so different in terms of codepaths that it would be almost impossible to do a direct comparison.",Neutral
AMD,"It’s not a choice between ideology or pragmatism, rather simple technological constraints.  Fundamentally, AMD and Intel GPUs can’t use this approach, since NVIDIA has a CPU on their GPU since Turing allowing for them to create this more powerful firmware.  AMD and Intel don’t, so they can’t do anything remotely to this level.     They could always make a closed source driver of course, but this would mean essentially maintaining a completely separate driver module out of the kernel, which would mean spending resources to ensure constant compatibility.",Neutral
AMD,"Right, but that wouldn't preclude them from having possibly included a hardware converter like Intel did on ARC. They don't have to convince the hdmi forum if they ship a hardware implementation with the GPU just outputting DP signals.  Of course, all speculation until the final hardware is out",Neutral
AMD,"Audio via HDMI supports return channels, DP doesn't. HDMI also simply has a lot more investment going into it",Neutral
AMD,I wonder what's going on there lol.,Neutral
AMD,ah yes... iOS.,Neutral

AMD,Unless your tv doesn't happen to support pass through of the codec you want because absolutely everything that touches the stream must be licensed for that specific codec.,Neutral
AMD,Ugh why didn't they just come up with a dedicated audio connection instead.,Negative
AMD,there are multiple ways to expose an audio device over TB.  It is completely possible for a TB display to also act as a bridge so that it forwards all other attached TB device to the host (video source) meaning from the video source you can then select what audio output as it would show up just the same as if you attached that audio output directly to it.,Neutral
AMD,USB and PCIe are both standards that are channeled through TB.   A thunderbolt display can act as a TB/USB multiplexer so it exposes attached USB/PCIe devices to the upstream video source.   Thus letting any audio device attached to it be directly addressable from the video source.,Neutral
AMD,In no way.,Neutral
AMD,">Yes, devices on either end would need to be upgraded over time but we would have way, way less cable waste was more my point   But you can still use older cables, even with full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 devices. It's not recommended, but nobody will stop you. If it doesn't work, an Ultra High Speed certified cable is only about $10/€10. That's not much when the AV receiver or soundbar alone costs one or more orders of magnitude more.   >How many HDMI cables do people have laying around from needing to upgrade to higher bandwidth cables, or worse threw them away and they're in landfill somewhere.

AMD,"Well, if it were easy to make a converter chip that works reliably, then we wouldn't be having this conversation.   Its not like Intel reached this crossroad and was like 'lol lets make it unreliable hehehe'",Negative
AMD,"Right, but signal integrity is affected by things like conductivity (heat) and interference (EMF). If it's a signal processing chip bw limitation, I'm surprised some premium cable company hasn't just put a more powerful chip in. In fact I'm surprised a premium cable company hasn't made a short-distance super thick monstrously overkill adapter/cable for this purpose.",Neutral
AMD,"If they have done that then this wouldn’t be an issue because they would just use the hardware converter, but seeing as it is an issue, then they don’t have a hardware converter in there, the older Intel Arc GPUs don’t have both a straight HDMI connection from the GPU and a converted HDMI, the ones that had converted HDMI *only* had converted HDMI.",Neutral
AMD,"Display port have to walk with its own leg, Thunderbolt (or USB 4) won’t be used on TVs. You have to be able to to the exact thing that you do with eARC.",Neutral

I have dozens in my closet that can't handle that bandwidth, nor the bandwidth of modern PC displays with high refresh rates and ultra wide resolutions. PCs would have also benefit from the optical cable solution.",Negative
AMD,"It'd be nice, but it would require a more powerful chip to exist - it's a pretty specialized thing, and you'd have a make back all of the money on designing and fabricating the chips (plus chip manufacturers are pretty slammed these days) and the only real use case I know of for these is for connecting TV to older GPUs or multiple TVs to GPUs with a single HDMI port.   I'd also have to see if you could draw enough power off of the power pin on the DP port to power anything significantly better  I don't really know, just throwing out some ideas of why they might not be gunning to do that right now",Neutral
AMD,"My point is we don't know yet, but we DO know they didn't do that on the Steam Deck.  It remains an issue for HDMI on Linux and AMD hardware either way, even if they do end up building in a workaround.  I hold more hope for that idea than Valve/AMD/anyone convincing the HDMI forum to stop being asshats about it though",Neutral
AMD,if you were to get rid of HDMI then why would one not replace that with a simple TB/USB4 connection.,Neutral
AMD,">And when you get up to HDR Vision with lossless Atmos audio, a lot of times the older HDMI cables do not hold up.

I you buy good cable today they will still be good cables even tomorrow.  >PCs would have also benefit from the optical cable solution  Optical cable solution is even worst in the PC space because nowadays you expect 1 cable that carry everything.",Negative
AMD,"Because a simple TB/USB4 needs the support from the SOC maker and it would be a more expensive solution than just a display port input.  Display port should be able to walk with its legs, in order to star a transition (not a replacement because you still need HDMI support for a long time) it has to have the same feature as HDMI. It must have an eARC replacement, CEC etc.  HDMI is used because it has everything a TV needs and it's licensing cost are negligible.",Neutral
AMD,"What are you even talking about? You can't use the vast majority of the older cables with the latest bandwidth requirements. You end up with signal dropouts. And no I did not cheap out. It's just the reality that if you're taking years ago, the cables were only made to the specs required at the time.. It's like having a cable now that supports 48Gbps and in 10 more years you need a cable for 16K video or something (theoretical, obviously) and the best of the best cables of today probably wouldn't support 192Gbps or whatever the new bandwidth requirement is. We reached a point where the quality of the HDMI cable absolutely does matter now where years ago it did not because of far less bandwidth requirements. This is my point of repeated obsoletion because the cables are only made to be just enough for whatever the current best quality is.",Negative
AMD,it requires you put in a USB-4 Doc within the TV.   You would not directly attach the TV SOC to the USB4 as those chips do not support the needed dock like features that would let the TV pass through other devices as audio targets.  why would display port add eArc when the entier point of modern display port is that can be tunnelled within USB so can use that ecosystem and protools for device handshakes.,Neutral
AMD,"""it requires you put in a USB-4 Doc within the TV""  It's frankly a very Frankenstein solution for something that is not needed. You have already a SOC that handle input/output of the TV.  >why would display port add eArc   Because that's the current workflow in the audio TV market.

AMD,">This coupled with the recent shortages of RAM for consumers and subsequent rise in their prices has got me worried. If this trend continues and AI race actually takes off, where does that leave normal PC enthusiasts / DIY culture that started in 1980's. We can't assemble computers without RAM, SSDs or GPUs.  DIY PC pays by far the least for silicon of any market, so it eats last. You can expect DIY PC builds to not really be sensible for many quarters.   Regrettably, we are in the very early innings on this trend. Things will get a lot worse before they get better. The first sign that things are normalizing will be sensible pricing on OEM PC builds. They are able to make volume contracts than retail can't support.  >Plus, the recent thrust by both Intel and AMD to go for APU / integrated architecture makes me believe that the industry is pushing consumers towards locked hardware that cannot be customized, and we all would eventually be forced to use NUCs or laptops that come with soldered RAM and CPU or even worse, integrated SOC with GPU.  APUs make a lot more sense than low-end dGPU products. Making a dGPU requires a bunch of infrastructure components that add cost and size to the design. Those things make sense if you are building something big and powerful. If you are instead making a mainstream 1080p graphics solution, an integrated graphics solution with on-package memory is cheaper and better.  >Would love to know your views on how this thing will eventually play out.

Meanwhile for nations, dependencies is being framed as a national security issue.  This is going to sound elitist, but at least for the gaming sphere, there is a thick layer of commercialism and surface layer understanding of how things work. The AMD day one driver debacle being the biggest ""self selection event""/litmus test I have ever seen. I think the issue with the gaming space though is that it defines themselves around performance of the hardware, which is why a shift or renewal needs to happen. That seems to be happening, considering how often people yap about no needing hardware and playing classics. Going down that road, then is there not a space for hardware manufactureres and/or a lower barrier to entry for manufactures if cutting edge is not so central anymore? Consider that consumer software still often runs on one core.  All in all I think expensive hardware and bad economy relatively chokes off the unhealthy aspect of DYI PC market, more than...let's say ""pure"" part of it. Also worth mentioning is that argueable, the packaging of a PC and the expertise relatively increases now, which is where convenient software and hardware solutions live. Take Dimm to Sodimm adapters. Generally just a meme even if they are cheap. Now that Dimm pricing is what it is though, that kind of optionality suddenly becomes more valueable. This is also true for mid level pc ""expertise"" that we enthusiasts have.  The cartel problem is largely tied to a global problem patents and rules that holds grassroots and open source two decade behind it no matter what, which turn so many issues and movements into very long games. Accessibility of automation, at home manufacturing and AI is going to put this issue on the agenda within a few decades I think.",Neutral

AMD,"I think you're reading too much into that one event. Remember that Micron/Crucial ended their Ballistix branding with DDR5 three years ago. They never had much in the way of offerings in the DDR5 generation, and what die they had were the worst of the three DRAM manufacturers. Micron chips work best around 5200 and can range up to 5600, but any kits above that rating are utilizing extremely binned chips at high voltages. I don't know of any reason why Micron couldn't redesign their DRAM to be competitive, but they clearly chose not to. Even Samsung's memory clocks higher, though it doesn't clock anywhere close to SK Hynix chips nor can reach their timings.  It's worth pointing out the people who had the most trouble with memory on their DDR5 builds were more often than not using Micron or Samsung based kits. I'm sure the heavy returns hurt their financials. But you should realize that Micron's current DDR5 offering was about to be made moot. Intel already clocks over 7000, and AMD is going to (farking finally) launch its 2nd gen DDR5 controller that should move the bar well above the 6000 sweet spot. Not even OEMs are going to be buying 5200-5600 kits regardless of price, meaning without a die redesign the only space left to offload chips would be servers and that's what Micron is now doing.  The AI bubble will pop, money isn't infinite and spending billions to make a few million every quarter isn't sustainable. There is no magic market that will materialize to fill in that gap disparity. Short of creating a true AI that can act as a people replacement the AI bubble is going to pop... AI won't truly go away, we're stuck with it just like we're stuck with the internet. But we are very much in a bubble and it's hard to imagine a scenario where the hundreds of billions being blown on datacenter deployments won't end up with a massive overbuild of DCs that will cause multiple bankruptcies in the future. I used to think there would always be enough demand elsewhere to keep former-AI DC's in use, but we're quickly building past that level.  As for breaking up NVIDIA, I'm not sure how that'd be feasible, they design a single base tier uArch and then scale it across all market segments. Forking the company into a consumer-only GPU division would probably just create another Radeon situation where the company keeps prices high to amortize its dev costs across the consumer market, instead of across all of its markets.  Micron isn't going anywhere, they're just focusing exclusively on servers and enterprise where the margins are largest and product support is easiest. The other day I read that Micron is now going to build a $9.6 billion dollar HBM fab in Japan. It's unfortunate but not unexpected, all three HBM vendors have been selling out their entire annual HBM production 12-18 months in advance since 2023. If other DRAM vendors still existed they would've already jumped ship to chase those silly numbers too.  Maybe at some point in the future when there's a single vendor for some piece of the computer hardware the market might be at risk. But it seems unlikely, because OEMs buy consumer level hardware and in order to supply OEMs they have to produce the same parts consumers would buy regardless. In Micron's case the DRAM they're producing isn't even good enough to meet OEM's needs, let alone consumers.  Edit: Will say I've been corrected, Micron does make a newer gen die for DDR5 that tops out at 6400 in 16/24Gb flavors, and it's even available under their own branding. But it's sure not common and still suffers from high timings.",Negative
AMD,"The stuff DIY gets is downstream from server parts right? I don't think Intel and AMD will stop making socketed chips for desktops, AMDs chiplet strategy allows it to efficiently use its dies in all sorts of products.

Even for Nvidia the geforce business is 5-10%, that's worth keeping around even if its totally neglected for AI; its good money and pretty well cornered.

Obviously that affects NVIDIA's pricing too because they can only produce a limited amount while paying a lot for that too.   AI on top of that is causing even more issues because of the margin they shift the limited supply towards server GPU's which means even less space for lower pricing.  The 30 series had really good pricing because it was fabbed with Samsung instead, so hope that Samsung and Intel finally step up their game to be real competition",Neutral

AMD,"Depends on price. Word on the street is that AMD gave Valve a reaaally good deal on 7600 dies.   Essentially it appears that AMD produced way too many Navi 33 dies, using an older node (6nm) to make them cheaper and more plentiful, expecting to put a lot of them in laptops. Apparently, OEMs preferred the more expensive (and more efficient) 4060 instead, and that left AMD with lots of Navi33 (RX 7600) dies on their hands.  Talking to AMD Valve probably saw an opportunity to take this excess capacity for cheap, and AMD saw an opportunity to recoup some cost, rather than risk throwing them away. I can imagine Valve getting those RX 7600 cards for maybe half the price of what a 9060XT would be (depending on memory prices).",Neutral
AMD,"Probably would have cost $100 more, but I think it would have been worth it. Almost PS5 Pro performance would have looked better. Plus better upscaling.",Positive
AMD,"All is forgiven if the steam machine is under $500. Anything more, and yeah, i agree.",Neutral
AMD,"Would have made a lot more sense.

AMD,Exactly.  I wouldnt consider a 3060 useable without dlss working wonders.  Especially at 4k where you need dlss performance or ultra performance.  Trying to do that without a proper upscaler is going to produce hideous results.,Negative
AMD,"$1000 also isn't a great look for a console killer. Between Sony releasing the PS5 Pro at a really steep price ($750/€800), both Microsoft jacking up the Xbox Series price (X for $650) and Sony doing the same (PS5 for $550) and Nintendo charging quite a bit more for the Switch 2 ($450) I'd say there's an opening here for a Steam Machine to enter the console market.  If Valve can release something that can compete with these consoles, at a similar price, with a similar feature set, but with also all the advantages of being a computer, then it's definitely worth it. Going from $1000 to $700 will open a huge market for Valve. Going to $600 would be the nail in the coffin for Xbox.   No online fees, lower game prices, your game library will never expire, infinite game catalogue, and you can use it as your main PC as well, for the same price as a normal console... Not a bad sales pitch.  BTW, lots of people are using a Steam Deck as their main console. If millions are happy with Deck performance, this is more than enough. If you want better, build your own, unlike with classic consoles, you can easily do it now.",Neutral
AMD,I doubt there are enough defective ones to be all salvaged. It'll be like the consoles where they're cut back to ensure as many dies can be used as possible,Negative

AMD,"Slapping the chip from the RX 9060/XT onto a laptop style motherboard would not be technically any more difficult than using the 7600M chip. The 7600M is itself just a slightly cutdown, underclocked desktop RX 7600 chip.  Both chips are physically pretty much the same size (200 mm2 give or take a few) and the desktop versions have very similar power usage.   The only reason to use the RX 7600 over the RX 9060 chip in this application is cost.",Neutral

AMD,"The steam machine doesn’t need to make money. The steam machine needs to get people to play PC games, which steam has an effective monopoly on. If Valve sells the steam machine at cost they’ll make money.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree, but it's still more work than just slapping the existing laptop board that's already engineered with the proper footprint, connections, inputs and outputs in there, because AFAIK there's no RDNA4 laptop parts at all and the most we have are the RDNA3.5 GPU in the PS5 Pro and the AI APUs",Negative
AMD,Any corporate mention of resolution and framerate is completely meaningless now because it only refers the output. It could be achieved by upscaling from 540p and with 4x frame gen (amd doesn't use it atm) and it still wouldn't be technically lying.,Negative
AMD,Frame gen and upscaling can't solve a lack of VRAM in many games either though (frame gen makes it even worse). Unless they're talking about FSR1 lol,Negative
AMD,"Yes it does, it can't be loss leader because otherwise people will just buy it for office use. They said it themselves.",Neutral
AMD,"Who is buying a steamOS machine for office use? Which office is going to bother buying this instead of any of the hundreds or thousands of offerings from T1 SIs that actually provide support and service? This thing doesn’t even use standard components, are you even going to get official drivers on Windows?",Negative
AMD,"They promoted the steam machine as being able to install other OS. If they don't support it then I suppose at least it would be really funny for how much people glazed them for it.   There will be companies buying it if it's cost effective due to valve eating costs. Hell, even if they don't, valve just have no control over it's userbase, it could have a really low acquisition rate from non steam users, just like steam deck, so all that loss leading would be for nothing.  If you are right then it's a pc, that you can't upgrade, that can't play hugely popular games like league of legends, GTA, battlefield or valorant. Device designed not for casuals and not for enthusiast. Just people who are okay with paying a lot of money to play old, locked in time, singleplayer games on TV. It has to support windows.",Neutral
AMD,"No sizable company is buying a ton of computers to replace the OS on them, especially not for this level of hardware. No normal user is buying a Steam Machine running SteamOS from Steam because they really want a Linux desktop.  The problem with charging a PC price instead of a console price is that it’s just worse than an actual gaming PC. Even with all the advances Valve has made to Linux gaming you still can’t play a lot of popular multiplayer titles, and hardware wise it’s essentially a 5-year old console. There’s just no justification to pay more than $500-600 for one of these.",Negative

As a result the 5070 gets decent market share.  Even as a pc builder myself, the 5070 is appealing in the Swedish market, and if I were in the market for a GPU right now, I'd definitely consider it.

AMD,"I mean it takes one second to check Amazon or any other major retailer, after which you will see that the 9000 series is selling really well compared to prior generations. 9000 series GPUs are straight up the most popular for DIY systems in several countries, especially outside the US, where Nvidia prices are especially high.  You could also look at AMD gaming revenue in order to make the same conclusion. 9000 series is selling well. It's not Nvidia numbers, but the cards are certainly moving in decent volume compared to the RDNA 3 flop.  Another anecdote is that system integrators seem to be putting more AMD cards in their systems than they used to, likely because the 9060XT is better value than 5060 Ti. Despite that, RDNA 4 numbers on steam are still low.  You can't look at the 7600XT growing from 0.2% to 0.8% THIS YEAR with the 9060XT or 9070/XT not even showing up on the damn list and tell me the data is representative.

AMD,Look at the Linux numbers. It’s overwhelmingly amd.   I do legit think there is a bug in collection on windows.  Not just amd cards but also nvidia newer cards due to a bug many of us think is happening on amd CPUs with an apu enabled. A lot of people are favoring x3d for gaming builds and the data looks weird there.   I have two desktops: a windows box with 265k and 6900xt and a Linux box with a ryzen 7900 and 9060xt. My wife has a 5900x with 7900xt and a 3700x with a nvidia 960 on Linux.   Steam last took surveys from my systems around June. That was before I got the 265k and 9060xt. (Had a 14700k in windows and arc a750 in Linux) my wife hasn’t had a survey since before she got the 7900xt last year.   I expect nvidia to win as well as Intel on cpu due to Internet cafes in Asia along with trends there on purchases but I still feel like amd and nvidia should have more share on their newer gpus.   Sometimes I wish valve did more breakdowns like what the specs are on systems with current gen CPUs and gpus. (Most popular current builds)  also builds by region.  I except a slam dunk for Intel and nvidia in Asia.  I would expect stronger market for amd in Germany and the US in part because of the Linux numbers,Negative

There is no need to look for conspiracy theories, people may have given the series 9000 a chance but there clearly a lack of every day system users actively playing on them to show on the steam hardware survey compared to RDNA3 or RDNA2 users.

AMD,"Yeah Intel losing 9% to Ryzen in a single year is absolutely dire, you can just see that line in the graph keep dipping in favour of AMD. It suggests new CPU marketshare that Ryzen is absolutely curbstomping Intel's offerings for Intel to still be bleeding so quickly even as the install base begins to approach 50/50. Ryzen is DEFINITELY going to get a majority sometime 2026, no way it isn't happening especially if Zen 6 comes that apparently will be on a new node with 12 core CCDs it'll be a good generational upgrade itself, Intel really won't be able to catch up, maybe keep up from falling behind worse but yeah AMD has the leadership right now in new CPUs. Zen 5 is already significantly faster in gaming and Zen 6 is going to extend it well over Zen 5, vs Zen 4 to 5 where it was Zen 5% and Intel Core Ultra flopping with less gaming perf and still less efficiency along with then recent problems with previous generations made Intel miss their opportunity hard.",Negative

It also shows the 7800 XT share increasing more in november alone (+0.13%)  than any 9000 series card over its entire lifetime (none crack 0.15%). It does not track with sales data whatsoever.  AMD representation is prebuilts was always very low, but has vastly increased due to the undeniably great value of the 9060XT. The 7600XT was a very poor seller, especially in prebuilts, which tend to go for cheaper options, since it was much more expensive than the 7600 and only offered extra VRAM.  Even more absurdly. The representation of the 7800XT in the Steam survey in has grown more in November alone (+0.13%) than the overall market share of any single 9000 series card. (none crack the 0.15% number to make it onto the list). Do you genuinely believe the 7800 XT sold more in november alone than any 9000 series card has since release?  It does not compute. It probably just registers the integrated graphics on the CPU or nothing at all for the GPU. I suspect that Valve just rejects DxDiag data from GPUs that have not been added to the list. I suspect they just haven't gotten around to adding the RDNA 4 cards there due to the change in naming scheme, while the 5000 series was added before release, since the naming scheme was consistent.  It clearly shows decent market share on Linux, which is admittedly likely to be inflated due to Nvidia drivers being pretty bad on Linux.

Making you - again - wrong. Shortages started earlier, 7800XT rise started later. Your made up theory literally does not stand up to any scrutiny.  Idk about this December 2024 shortage, but i do know that RTX 40 series production had been stopped around that time.   You can see that all GPUs rose in price (including the 7800XT) all the way till March, when the new GPUs actually dropped in stores (for a day or two). After which they (7800xt and 7600xt) were pretty nicely priced, while all new gen cards sat way above MSRP.",Negative
AMD,"There definitely are issues and certainly some 9000 series cards are probably grouped up under ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" or ""AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics"", possibly due to driver issues or maybe iGPU problems.

Not even in the slightest. >  > You can even see that they increased a lot as soon as their successors released at higher than MSRP with limited stock.  Do you even comprehend what ""a lot"" means in this context? This would have to be the most massive sell off of apocalyptic proportions. During march of 2025 7800XT went from selling less than <0.15% during 17 prior months to selling at least as much in one month to get to 0.28% in april, according to steam.  > How did you ""completely demolish"" my theory? You just said that the 7700xt and 7900xt haven't kept up with the other two (7800XT and 7600XT). How does that disprove anything?  Because such a thing is absolutely improbable. If you were not so invested in making the same excuses for months now you would see this too.  Your whole theory absolutely crashes also because those ""clearance sales"" you are talking about seem to never end. By late May nvidia had their supply mostly under control, by the end of summer that happened with RDNA4 too. If your theory had any ground these sales should have slowed down dramatically multiple months ago. Yet 7800XT literally kept pace with 5080 this year. Just an absolute joke.  > while the 7800XT and 7600XT both with 16GB of VRAM sat at very attractive price points.  No they didn't. 7600XT was always overpriced, and since 5060/9060XT/5060Ti release it's just terrible value, yet you want to convince me people started buying them exactly at the worst time, LOL. Regular 7600 that came out long before 7600XT does not show up at all BTW, despite usually being 50% cheaper than XT version and not having proper competition, totally normal. 7800XT was not great value during that time either, 5060TI 16GB is priced closely and generally even cheaper than 7800XT, for 10% more performance very few people will pick last gen AMD card.   > After which they (7800xt and 7600xt) were pretty nicely priced, while all new gen cards sat way above MSRP.

AMD,"It's astronomically worse on Optane. On Intel, the issue can be somewhat alleviated by disabling C-states completely - Intel have a lot of documentation recommending this for Optane drives.  The other part of the equation is Windows 11 Virtualisation defences - both user level and deep system level need to be disabled to claw performance back.

AMD,"This has always been the way of things. The problem with Ryzen's chiplet design is that latency between cores, IO die, and devices is unusually poor, which you'll see the effects of in latency-sensitive tasks, which includes your rapid random IO to and from SSDs.  In terms of a fix, you can probably claw back some performance by disabling some power saving features and clocking IF as high as it will safely go, but it's an inherently poor architecture for that sort of workload, and you can't really tweak and configure your way around that.",Negative

AMD,Qualcomm is making consumer only chips that are cheap too. Snapdragon x plus was cheaper than lunar lake while still matching in battery life,Positive
AMD,"The problem that transferring data between SSD halted is probably due to AM5 only has PCIE 4x4 connecting the chipset and CPU. Assuming you have one SSD connecting directly to CPU and one connecting to the chipset, if both SSD are PCIE 4x4, it would easily eat up all the bandwidth.",Neutral
AMD,"If this is software issue, there is software fix. It is also something worth to check.",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks, I suspected this to be the case too, but the behavior is surprisingly undesirable if this were the case. Things are all good until too much data is transferred at a time, where the transfer speeds tank to literally 100-200MB/s between two PCIe 4x4 drives.   This can be easily induced with multiple data transfers happening at the time, but it's not limited to those scenarios. I can plug in a SATA drive to have the third disk drive transferring files to either of the existing two, or start large downloads writing to one of my disks, and the system will be paralyzed with sub 100MB/s transfer speeds across all devices combined.  My mobo's front drive slot is actually PCIe 5 connected to the CPU, and the secondary one is PCIe 4 connected to the chipset, so the hardware should theoretically easily accept faster drives.  While seeking support, I was told it is expected behavior due to IO bottlenecks that aren't restricted by pure bandwidth, but the logic queueing the requests that can get overwhelmed.  The same drives worked far more consistently on a Kaby Lake PCIe 3 mobo.",Negative

AMD,At some point you quickly saturate the DRAM buffering the QLC as well.  Its 12000KB per second... for the first .01 second.,Neutral
AMD,I’m not exactly sure what “over time” means here.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm quoting from the post you replied to. To me, ""over time"" implies initial transfer performance is great, but then tails off.  I can't see a PCIe bottleneck causing that kind of behaviour. Thinking about it, I wonder if they're seeing SLC caches being exhausted if the copies are large enough?",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for inquiring! By ""over time"" I mean that my transfers can be neat multiple GB per second, and then fall. But the most consistent way of reproducing the issue is by adding additional IO operations (say, also copy to a SATA SSD, or initiate a couple of file downloads) the speeds fall to a fraction of that. They get massacred when I use Opera and enable parallel downloading (which basically downloads each file in bits in parallell), where I can get sub 100MB/s transfers across all disks.",Neutral

AMD,">Worst case scenario upgrading to a 5060 from your old 1050 laptop would still be a very noticeable improvement.  but since the [5050](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihJRJryQXTE) & [5060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VM_H7soWBQ) doesnt seem to have much of a performance boost compared to RTX 4060 & 4070, are older laptops with RTX 4060 & 4070 still viable picks if they're cheaper?  The main thing is that I want a sub 2kg laptop with dedicated GPU and 32GB RAM, so the main laptops I'm eyeing rn are either:  * 2023 ROG Zephyrus G14 * 2024 HP Omen Transcend 14  but their new RTX 4060 versions are still hovering around 1300 USD in my country, way above my budget.  So ofc I'm hoping that their price substantially goes down either during Black Friday or 12/12 sale, but do you think that they're even still worth pursuing or should I just focus on 2025 & upcoming laptops? (My third pick that fits my requirements is the new Legion 5, but that one's even more expensive atm)  Also technically there are three used laptop stores trying to sell a used RTX 4070 Omens to me at 1300 USD, but no way used stores are going to give any substantial Black Friday discounts",Neutral
AMD,#1 usecase for these in AI is running medium sized MoE models for local LLMs.  And for that they offer a pretty compelling solution. You basically have to spend twice as much to do it with Apple. At which point you're not using CUDA either.  ROCm works and inference engines like llama.cpp also support Vulkan compute AI.  It's basically the most power efficient and most cost efficient solution on the market for local LLMs.,Positive
AMD,"Well, mobile ai, these things don’t use sodim ram (or ram sticks in general) and the speeds of ddr5x aren’t used for most CPU’s. This very well could be also targeting mobile ai ( specifically more ai/gaming where the 395+ was targeting development and simulations as well). Also ai doesn’t need cuda, rocm exists and it’s quite good, any downfalls of amd is on a architectural level, but if you’re doing local ai on the go then you don’t really need cuda if that makes sense.",Neutral
AMD,This is the strongest gpu they have available,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but this is the version with the best GPU with the least cores, so it becomes the best for handhelds",Positive
AMD,"From a power point of view disabled-by-binning cores would be exactly the same as if you disabled them in the OS, or just didn't have enough work for the OS to schedule threads on them.  Any real savings would require a new die (and there may well be possible savings there, less complex busses, easier routing, fewer ports on sram blocks etc - but I suspect they might be relatively small), but this isn't that.  The *only* advantage this would have over the ""full fat"" die is cost. And that still depends on yields and how much supply of these binned dies they actually get.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but this is version with the best GPU with the lower amount of cores. So the best possible in terms of performance for a handheld",Positive
AMD,You can set the TDP to 15W actually,Neutral

AMD,"Mi450x is shipping in Q3 with zen6, and zen6 server chips are already in partner hands from latest earnings call",Neutral
AMD,"Unless the extra efficiency of the new CPUs are a factor for you then you aren't missing much getting a 2023 or 2024 laptop and yes the 4060 and 4070 are still plenty viable, the 5060 usually almost matches the 4070 but you're going to have a similar experience most of the time between the 4060, 4070, 5060 and 5070 most of the time. So yes, if you can get a 4060 cheaper then go for it.

AMD,Well i was saying this wouldn’t be enough anyway. I agree some handheld specific die would need to be made.,Neutral

If you want a good IGPU, you're getting at least 8 cores.  You can always disable them in the OS or UEFI if you're really dead-set on it.

There's optimal intersection points and sometimes with a moderate price increase, you'll get drastically fewer sales. But there's some customers that are not as price sensitive, so bumping it 50 won't lose that group.   Hopefully that makes sense.",Neutral
AMD,"Companies are valued based on their gross and operating margins. If their costs rise, they also have to increase their sale prices by the same percentage, or those margin rates go down, which reduces the valuation of the company. Distribution and retailer also take a percentage of the product value as their margin. So even if the oem only raises the product price by the higher costs, retailers still increase the price based on the percentage increase.",Neutral
AMD,"The same reason Intel's Lunar Lake was a one-off.  Companies run a percentage profit margin they report to their investors. If they produce a good that costs 50$ to make, and sell it for 100$, then they have a profit margin of 50%. For investors this means that every dollar they put into production results in 2 dollars of capital, which is a good indicator for potential growth, and, of course, potential dividend payout.  If costs increase by 10$, then, if price were left unchanged, their profit margin would sink to 40%. if They increase their price by 10$ as well their profit margin would sink to ~55%. Investors will look at those numbers and conclude that the company is doing poorly: it is no longer able to achieve the same return on investment that it did previously, and they might just conclude that their money can be better spent elsewhere and cancel further investments.  So, a 10$ cost increase results in a 20$ price hike. In reality, profit margins aren't really that high for third-parties like Asus and others, investors can be persuaded that the costs aren't due to mismanagement and companies will take a hit in profitability in the short-run to maintain marketshare (although, again, AIB companies generally run razor-thin profit margins).  Another reason for adding margin to price-hikes is Machiavellian psychology: Gigabyte and others know the way the wind is blowing, RAM prices are going to keep climbing for the foreseeable future and people respond worse to smaller price increases every month than a big price increase every 6 months. So they'll add some padding now, 'worst' case they can drop the price later or give greater discounts during sales, best case they're better insulated from any future inflation.",Neutral
AMD,Money. Corporations are evil and not your friends,Neutral
AMD,">Why does Asus, Gigabyte, etc, get to make $30 more profit when they spend $20 on memory?  Why not?  They operate based on profit margins.  If they're earning a 50% profit margin, then a $20 increase in input costs will result in $30 increase to the selling price.  Plus, just because NAND contracts went up by $X doesn't mean that's what it costs manufacturers, because they're still bidding against each other for actual supply.  If they don't wanna sit there with 0 stock for the next 6 months, they'll need to bid up the price even higher.",Negative
AMD,Because that’s how margins work.  It’s not sold directly from the manufacturer.,Neutral
AMD,"Because they have to maintain profit margins. They aren’t going to take a hit to margin just cause the materials got more expensive.  If you only raise the retail price by the same amount of the cost of building the card increase, then your profit margin decreases.",Neutral
AMD,"Input costs only determine the viable price floor.  The market (buyers) determine the price. They can all increase prices $50 because people will buy it. They’re also now making more profit per unit which nearly always offsets the loss of customers.  Imagine their costs are $80 and they sell for $120, that’s a $40 profit and a 50% return. Costs increase $20 to $100, price goes up $50 to $170, and all of a sudden returns are 70%, and profit per unit has almost doubled. They can sell almost half as many units and be behind in revenue but ahead in profits, which is the most important part.",Neutral
AMD,They have a legal obligation to make as much money as possible. Gamers have shown since the crypto eras and onward that we’ll pay more for hardware than they thought possible. I just saw a whole thread from someone who bought a 5090 to game casually on non-graphically intense titles and do office work. We’ve signaled to these hardware companies that PC gaming is a luxury.,Negative
AMD,They don't. The OEMs buy kits that contain both the GPU die and the memory. AMD charges the OEM a margin on top of the kit cost. AMD and Nvidia typically don't change the margin target when the BOM increases because they typically don't need to do so to meet sales targets.,Neutral
AMD,Because margins are a percentage and not flat rate.  And are the primary grade for the stock market.  For 90% margins (as an example) you would need to increase the price by 200 dollars for a 20 cost increase.,Neutral
AMD,"Return on investment, they have to maintain a certain %",Neutral

AMD,"As the other responders have stated, it's to maintain percentage based margin. This was covered by a recent HWU video on this exact topic, where they explained that the memory usually comes in a bundle deal with the core from Nvidia/AMD. So Nvidia/AMD are creating the lion's share of the increase here. I think board partners are already squeezed pretty tight, especially by Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Margin. They are targeting a fixed margin (measured in %), not a fixed profit per card (measured in $$). They just had an earnings where they said they want very high margins. If they only pass BOM costs directly to the consumer, it means their margin per card will decrease.  Still total horseshit, but that's their calculus, largely.",Neutral
AMD,Because you'll pay for it anyway,Neutral
AMD,"When prices go up, demand goes down, so they're going to sell fewer units. They need to increase price more than their increase in cost to make up for the lost volume.  This is a fairly straightforward optimization problem. Total profit = per unit profit \* volume. There's also a tradeoff between per unit profit and volume: The higher the per unit profit (and therefore sale price) the lower the volume, and vice versa. When per unit profit is zero then total profit is zero, and likewise when volume is zero total profit is also zero. Somewhere between those two extremes there's a point of maximum total profit. Because per unit profit is price - cost, a change is cost is going to have a relatively larger effect on per unit profits, possibly even putting it negative without a price change. This will cause the optimal price point to move towards higher per unit profit, lower volume. This is what causes the price to go even higher than just the increase in cost.  Thinking of it as greed isn't helpful. This is a very straightforward logical deduction. They don't need increased costs to be an ""excuse"" to raise prices, they can do that anyway and they were already doing their best to optimize their price for maximum profits before.",Negative

Suddenly it's a shit deal.   If nVidia made a fixed profit per card, you'd never see anything above a 5050.

Only other I could find was the MSI Ventus but I've heard not great things about that one.

AMD,"I'm not sure I like that table analogy. To me it's like you're building a table for 8 hours and getting $200 in labour and praying $100 in wood, tools, etc. you'd probably charge $300 for the table. $100+$200.  33.3% is your cost in parts, and 66.6% is your profit margins that is also your hourly pay in a way.   Now imagine your parts cost went up by $100 to $200. Do you now charge $200+$200? (You pass the cost onto the consumer) Or do you charge $200 for parts/supplies plus ANOTHER $400 for the labour, because you think the 100% increase parts/supplies cost also justifies you getting a 100% hourly wage increase. After all, you want to maintain the same 66.6% margin. $200-$400.   I think in a small business like this, that would be insane to demand you get double the annual revenue and profit margin in salary. If I went from 66k a year annual net income to 133k, because my supplies cost went from 33k to 66k, that would be weird. Now admittedly, you'd sell a lot fewer tables, so you'd probably not hit those yearly goals. But in part that's your own fault for doubling your table sale price.   The second you have investors, it's suddenly justifiable though. Which to me makes the system look broken.  Personally I think what's going on is that that WANT to sell less gaming GPUs. Just like in the example above you might want to sell fewer tables. AMD is filtering their RDNA4 supply to server instead I'd guess.",Negative
AMD,"But at the quarterly reports they do report other numbers.   ""Third quarter revenue was a record $9.2 billion, gross margin was 52%, operating income was $1.3 billion, net income was $1.2 billion""  I believe by maintaining that gross margin of 52%, all those other numbers will go way up, as a result of more cost, while maintaining margin.",Neutral
AMD,"""making less than before.""  Bubble is saying price was originally sold at $100 if it was $20 in parts it goes up $10(imagine no other costs).  Why don't them make it $110 instead of $150.  You are thinking that ""they don't expect to sell the same number of them"" so that means it shouldn't be $150, as economies of scale are smaller so it should be $170 instead.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, fair that. It's all about the what companies think the price elasticity is for their product. If we increase our price by 10%, is loss in number of sold units big enough to make our actual profit/revenue smaller than before the increase? It's all a big guess.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah for me I’m coming from a discount 3070 so I can almost justify the price as is. If $699 holds thru December it becomes $665 factoring in chase 5% PayPal used at Walmart.

AMD,"You analogy makes even less sense, and keep mixing up what you're actually calculating, and muddying the water by adding the materials in there. My point was that it's fair to ask for more money based on how much you've invested, be that either time (hours worked) or money (buying materials)      Philosophically: If my profit margin is 100% based on the labor, an increase in cost of materials has no impact on it.    You ALSO forgot to account for the cost of you time, i.e. how much are these 8 hours worth if I'm not building this table. What is 8 hours at minimum wage? What's 8 hours working for somebody elses company worth? This is opportunity cost. You're just assuming the labour is 100% profit, which breaks real-word profitability analysis.    To make it fair, you should be calculating the cost of hiring someone to build the table, and you then sell it. You're not going to have 66.6% profit margins.  Anyway...  If the parts cost goes up to $200, and my hours worked stays the same, an absolute minimum price would be $400. And especially if you market your services as ""no profit on materials, only work"". You might do this, because sales/VAT taxation reasons like if materials are taxed higher, but labour is lower. So you give a receipt for materials, bill them as paid-for (0 profit) and then bill your work.    This way of doing things, your profit margin technically doesn't change, since the material is expensed at-cost, your business is selling your labor. You're just expensing the materials, not selling it to the customer. It's almost a balance sheet transaction, that doesn't appear on the P&L.  So no, it has nothing to do with investors, it has to do with you disregarding basic finance and looking at labour as free.",Negative

AMD,What is up with the different visuals at the same settings between the cards? The AMD version seems to be missing or have downgraded visuals.,Neutral
AMD,"Well, it seems AMD has something... Sarcasm aside, nice to see DF's input on this 'early look' of FSR RR.  A lot of strange things observed. With the same settings AMD has some things omitted compared to Nvidia, as seen with shadows in a distance, it's quality, as well with objects reflected like with lights (can't say for sure if this an AMDs or dev thing, regardless it doesn't matter to the end user to who's fault).  With FSR RR, the most noticeable spotted difference from at first glance is the retrieval quality and AA from the reconstructed/regenerated scene. DLSS RR is better which shouldn't be shocking. This is due to how AMD does their upscaling passes with RR, as you can choose whatever upscaling method you want with RR and how it can be clearly seen with water reflections. FSR4 Perf is noticeably blurrier than FSR4 Native when comparing the reflections in the water, while it wouldn't matter what DLSS quality setting you use in conjunction w/ DLSS RR. As an aside, I found it interesting how FSR4 Perf had better texture detail on the letters than DLSS4 Perf (that said perhaps could be a sharpening thing outside of the upscalers used).  Moving on, FSR RR has missing features as noted with how reflections should be reconstructed. Reflected objects/scenes do not correctly diffuse, and are sharp throughout (typing this, I use [10:20](https://youtu.be/RuASMLRGFus?si=p1ECIQiTwNLLxeT0&t=617), but interestingly enough w/ DLSS RR, the gun has noticeable artifcating maybe due to the denoiser?). Environments with FSR RR do not have correct contact lighting as seen with the part about the trash can.  AMD does have some things going for it (though, I suspect is more per game basis). In motion, DLSS RR while clearer experiences more ghosting/smearing elements compared to FSR RR. That said, can't be said for the disocclusion aspect as seen with swapping guns with water in the foreground (that said I wonder if this is again the same problem with the upscaler/denoiser pass with FSR RR or if the problems with game settings between AMD and Nvidia has something to do with it like SSR).  There are things to note about performance, but isn't wildly different, so I won't make comments there.  Overall, again strange to say the least. It's obvious FSR RR isn't quite done, which can be worrying considering it's still one part of Redstone. Also, the game itself isn't a good test bed for the feature (as if it only being enabled for MP wasn't obvious enough) as there are bugs and instabilities. I guess, if anything, AMD has a step in the door which will have improvements. That said, isn't quite like with FSR4 in terms of wow. Not only that FSR4 can easily be swapped with Optiscaler and recently in AMD's own driver with most DX12 games. This one seems to be dependent on AMD actually implementing it with games so unless there are workarounds no DLSS RR swapping with FSR RR.",Neutral
AMD,"I was hoping Ray Regeneration was going to be a simultaneous denoising and upscaling approach, they were [investing research in it](https://gpuopen.com/learn/neural_supersampling_and_denoising_for_real-time_path_tracing/) and suggested they had something working in [an admittedly artifact-ridden demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vLil19mBs&t=21s). Instead this seems to be a spatiotemporal ML denoiser. It's completely decoupled from upscaling so appears to be denoiser pass before upscaling which ends up cutting out high frequency details and reconstructing to a lower res so you don't get that sharp DLSS RR resolve.   At least in it's current form it's not really an effective competitor to DLSS RR, rather it's competing with standard denoisers like NRD. Which makes me worry about adoption - NRD is vendor agnostic, as are most denoisers. I doubt this could be injected generally like Optiscaler since it is decoupled from upscaler outputs and probably designed to run in it's own pass. Maybe it could be modded to run on DLSS RR inputs before upscaling if the algorithm is general enough? While I hope it's better by Redstone showing I don't see how they could improve the detail reconstruction if it's acting before upscaling  Edit: not to undermine what has been achieved here - it's a very competent denoiser, and imo beneficial over COD's default at identical cost. it just doesn't push any boundaries whereas DLSS RR remains surprisingly coherent when reconstructing small RT details or high gloss reflections",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, IIRC when FSR FG released, the Square Enix game that was poorly received, had frame pacing problems. It was then around when Avatar released FSR FG was solid and at the time in terms of performance was quite competitive with DLSS3 FG's HW accelerated Optical Flow overhead.  Reality is, no one should really expect AMD to have Nvidia features day one or even have parity. It is more so that AMD should have a relatively decent cadence to have said features so that buyers aren't left out.  I am curious on what they have to say. To me RR seems to be more involved than upscaling and FG as there are already a lot of routes for the developer to take to implement the slew of upscaling methods. Adoption will be the hurdle even more so than before",Neutral

AMD,"I'm guessing the issues with contact hardening is mainly down to how the network was trained, reconstructing glossy reflections from low sample counts in real-time is challenging and one where DLSS RR is obviously better. Because it's denoising at internal resolution, the start of the hardening penumbra will be be softer than DLSS RR even if it should be sharp. Compared to the in-game denoiser I think FSR RR is actually mostly beneficial (except the water which has had all the ripple detail removed and the extreme ghosting with gun disocclusion) and it seems to be free, although DLSS RR isn't horrifically expensive on newer cards. I'm hoping this is a stepping stone to a simultaneous denoising and upscaling solution because the magic of DLSS RR is it's ability to reconstruct sharp ray traced detail even at low internal resolution, something that this multi pass technique probably can't do (although it can be made sharper, [NRD managed it by denoising with a detail recovery pass that respected DLSS jitter](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRD?tab=readme-ov-file#improving-output-quality)).  Optiscaler is magic in getting FSR4 in most titles but I fear this technique won't see much adoption at all - denoising passes aren't typically general so this is something that would need per-engine integration. I suppose it could intercept RR inputs (assuming there's equivalent) to do one pass denoise then standard upscale but unless the inbuilt denoiser is terrible it's probably not worth it",Neutral

Reflex 2 is starting to be in the same category of bullshittery, they marketed 50 series on a feature that isn't out in any games and it's been almost a year without the feature. The only difference is NVIDIA won't push out a feature unless it's ready, whereas AMD force it out when its half-baked like Anti-lag which got people banned from online games or as Firefox72 said FSR FG which was broken in a bunch of games on release.

[https://i.imgur.com/td0Vqqm.png](https://i.imgur.com/td0Vqqm.png)     [https://i.imgur.com/rxexoDm.png](https://i.imgur.com/rxexoDm.png)  On the plus side it appears to be cheaper to run than Nvidia's solution.,Neutral
AMD,"Please, have a game with heavy rt to showcase it.  Cyberpunk  Bm wukong Alan wake 2 Indiana Jones   These are the heaviest rt titles. Okay cyberpunk rt/PT is kinda easier to run than the rest",Neutral
AMD,Just in time for AMD GPU price increases,Neutral
AMD,well see in Minecraft,Neutral
AMD,It's just a bunch of ML-based features that enhance RT/PT performance and quality,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia equivalent features basically.,Neutral
AMD,"Funny enough, Asrock just mentioned FSR 4.1 on Twitter.",Neutral
AMD,"It's worth noting that Blops7 only has the RR and FSR4 parts of it, and that RR is not on a version 1.0 yet. Redstone should include the following according to AMD:  * **FSR Upscaling:** (Formerly AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution) Reconstructs crisp, high-quality visuals from low-resolution frames.  * **FSR Frame Generation:** Predicts and inserts new frames between rendered ones, delivering smoother and higher frame rate gaming.  * **FSR Ray Regeneration:** Infers and restores full-quality ray-traced detail from sparse samples, delivering sharp, noise-free visuals with reduced rendering cost.   * **FSR Radiance Caching:** Dynamically learns and then predicts how light propagates through a scene, delivering efficient real-time global illumination.    Of these, we already have FSR4, though a 4.1 or something could come out with this. Ray Regen was the new thing previewed in COD so far. We have yet to see FSR4 Frame Gen or whatever the ML-based solution will be or how their radiance caching implementation will differ from Nvidia's.",Neutral
AMD,"Just an important note, BLOPS7's version is listed at .9, so it's possible (or likely) that the official release will bump the version and may have other changes.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia has 2 Ray reconstruction versions. The improved CNN model one and the more recent transformer version. The transformer RR is amazing and by far the best denoiser available for video games. The CNN version is overall better than regular denoiser partly because regular denoisers look flat out awful (it's hard for devs to make denoisers), but CNN version does have compromises and some implementations by devs aren't as good as others.   Unlike Transformer DLSS upscaling the RR Transformer model is very punishing on Turing and Ampere but runs very well on Ada and Blackwell.",Positive
AMD,"Thanks for the helpful post, i recommend checking out [ImgBB](https://imgbb.com/) for posting photos. Imgur is cancer.",Positive
AMD,Some other features are more relevant than ray reconstruction as RT is so rarely used even on more powerful nvidia cards due to how extremely taxing it is. Most of use is on older titles with few gens of hardware advancements. Latest games can butcher even RTX 5090 into sub 60fps with DLSS.  Redstone should bring other improvement than this as per older AMD claims,Neutral
AMD,"Not gonna happen, all those are Nvidia sponsored titles (maybe not Indy, I don't remember about that one). Redstone will probably come to Cyberpunk a year after its release and it will be the worst implementation possible. Optiscaler will very likely make Redstone compatible with those games long before their developers do.",Negative
AMD,AC Shadows can be pretty beefy with the RT too,Neutral
AMD,"It's hard enough for an upcoming game to support FSR4 from the start, it would be even harder for existing games to add support for this and maybe benefit 1% of their players.",Negative
AMD,Yeah they need a few big titles at launch at least to show it off. Maybe BF6 when it gets its RT update?,Neutral
AMD,"As if nvidia won't do this, lmao. Everyone with any sort of DRAM will, many already did. We're fucked",Negative
AMD,Nvidia has increased prices for lesser reasons. Stop it.,Negative
AMD,So it is a RT/PT specific upgrade to FSR4?,Neutral
AMD,We have path tracing at home.,Neutral
AMD,Is it possible to upgrade the RR version to transformer like DLSS or are you stuck with the version the dev used?,Neutral
AMD,"Ugh this again. On average modern RT (not PT) isn't really all that taxing on modern hardware. Now we have games that are built with RT in mind, have no legacy raster path and run well even on a 2060 Super like Indiana Jones TGC and Doom TDA. You gotta remember the RT in these games have to run on a PS5 which is weaker than a 2060 at RT, some even run on a series S, hell Star Wars Outlaws has **several** RT effects running on a Switch 2!   If a Series S and Switch 2 can do it how the hell can modern PC GPUs struggle with it. Now if you wanna min max and drop your settings to achieve 200+ fps that's fair but that doesn't mean RT is gonna make a modern GPU explode.",Negative
AMD,"?? Not really, Redstone is literally just Ray regeneration, a new frame generation version, FSR4, and radiance caching. Is there some secret feature That we're all unaware of?",Neutral
AMD,Stop being stuck in 2020. RT is not taxing if your hardware isnt obsolete.,Negative
AMD,"At least not indiana jones, that has locked dlss inputs, so unless theres official implementation, there will be nothing",Negative
AMD,"But like the other user, most people forget it exists.",Neutral
AMD,It's not hard at all to support this. Takes some dev time but is basic engine plumbing. What is hard is implementing the real time path traced renderer that these techs are designed to support. But engines that already utilize denoising and upscaling in their pipelines could benefit from it even if they aren't path traced.,Negative
AMD,FSR 4 is in damn near every AAA game at launch since they released the SDK.,Negative
AMD,"Stop what lol, it's true?",Neutral
AMD,can we not defend any corporations instead of taking sides cuz thats just weird,Negative
AMD,Is that supposed to make it ok?,Neutral
AMD,It has nothing to do with FSR just like how DLSS Ray Reconstruction and frame generation have nothing to do with super sampling. It's really its own thing. They're just uniting these technologies under the FSR name so that it's easier to understand and market,Neutral
AMD,You can override it in the Nvidia App.,Neutral
AMD,"I would still argue it can be (implemented) inefficiently, not for 200fps but for APUs or even to extend say the handheld/Switch2's battery",Negative
AMD,"And those are far more beneficial than ray reconstruction. Barely anyone plays with RT, especially on AMD GPUs anyway. Maybe with like RX 9070 XT in 5 year old games.   Not to mention RT is dying over Lumen and similar software  implementations. So yeah, tiny portion of RX 9070 XT users will maybe use it if the get back replay some older fame - yay...   Better FSR and better frame gen is what benefits most.",Neutral
AMD,"then check benchmarks, lmao..   I won't bother with many examples, but https://ibb.co/SXN9Yyr2  sub 60fps on fucking RTX 5070 Ti at 1440p (DLSS quality) 🤡 My gosh this sub is high on some drugs and doesn't even watch benchmarks, just vomit bullshit",Negative
AMD,"by hard I meant the incentive for dev to do it, as AMD only makes up a tiny fraction of players, and dev time to add it is more or less the same as DLSS, so game studio would just be ""nah just do DLSS and 90% of our player will be happy""",Neutral
AMD,"There's obviously a negative connotation in that comment, as if AMD planned this release to coincide with the price increases. Also a negative inference that somehow the price increases are unjustified.",Negative
AMD,"You're delusional if you think people don't play with RT on AMD GPUs.  I have a 9070 non-XT (albeit BIOS-modded and disgustingly overclocked, so about on par with an XT). I always turn RT on, and I tend to max it out without issues. I play Witcher 3 maxed out at 1440p with RTGI and Optiscaler FSR 4 at about 90 FPS base. Enable FG and it's hitting my monitor refresh rate, with the base framerate high enough that the input lag doesn't feel bad.  Even Cyberpunk is fully playable with path tracing if you're willing to drop down to FSR 4 balanced. It sits at around 45-60 FPS, or around 90-110 FPS with frame gen. Obviously path tracing doesn't look all that great without an ML denoiser, but it's completely playable with PT on, and will look absolutely stunning once we get RR on AMD, not to mention feel even better if NRC works in the game, since it should yield a 20-30% boost in PT performance.  And remember, a 9070XT will do 10-15% better than my 9070, so RT is absolutely being used on AMD.  Also Lumen sucks ass. It looks worse than proper hardware RT and is only popular because UE5 is popular.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately lumen costs nearly as much as RT and arguably looks worse in every way.  Not sure that makes much sense. Also I don't even get this reply. I said what it is and you say ""and that's enough"". No shit it's enough. I asked you what magical thing you dreamed up that it also had.",Negative
AMD,"Lumen is RT though, but because it's software based it's the worst of both worlds. Massive performance impact while it doesn't even always look better than good raster. The temporal accumulation need for Lumen also brings with it the worst ghosting ever. Low fidelity software RT is absolutely not the future.  In games that actually have hardware Lumen the performance is only slightly worse on good RT GPUs while the visuals are massively improved. In theory at equal visual fidelity hardware Lumen would give you much better performance than software Lumen. That's just common sense as you have extra hardware to accelerate it.       In the couple of games with mandatory RT that have a software fallback you can see that performance decreases significantly when you fall back on the software version.  Epic knows software Lumen sucks when GPUs have good hardware support for RT (afterall there's no reason not to use dedicated hardware) so they're already shifting towards defaulting hardware Lumen in the recent UE5 versions",Negative
AMD,Lumen has both software and hardware implementation. Lumen software implementation is a lot more taxing than ahrdware RT and is in fact advised against. To the point where the latest Unreal version has it off by default.,Neutral
AMD,>shady link  >emoji  Im talking to a 5 year old arent i?,Neutral
AMD,"It was obviously not planned, but it's been nearly 7 years of this shit. While AMD, Nvidia, etc have no control over these big periodic demand spikes, it's frustrating for consumers nonetheless. Also cry me a river when it comes to ""fairness"" in the context of multi-billion $ companies.",Negative
AMD,Why do you think the price increases are justified then?,Neutral
AMD,"Nobody said that, but yknow twist my words for your own benefit",Negative
AMD,"Which I specifically noted - with exception of some old titles. Barely anyone replay those, it's tiny fraction. Like I've 100% Witcher 3 like 4 times before even they added RT patch. I'm not gonna replay it for the 5th time just for RT alone when I know game by memory. Similarly with CP2077. Small fraction..  Then take any more recent game: https://ibb.co/4wxJjMx4 or https://ibb.co/3yhTtMvw or https://ibb.co/1YxcVNZq and it falls apart, which is where highest player counts are, not in the 2 GPU gen old titles (or even older such as Wicher 3).  So you just also showed you CAN'T READ, because I accent clearly, that it's fine in old game or with very soft RT implementations like RT ambient occlusion found in Dead Space Remake or Metro Exodus.",Neutral
AMD,"HW Lumen butchers performance, check some benchmarks lmao.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-SlJiiaAXo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1oshjHNTWw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI_mqHo3698  30-40%+ gains depending on scene in software mode over hw mode. That's more than generation of HW progress these days.. So stop talking bullshit it costs nothing.",Neutral
AMD,"It's not slightly worse. Look at fucking benchmarks, like The Outer Worlds 2 butchers RTX 5090 when Hardware Lumen is enabled.   And AMD DOESN'T EVEN HAVE GOOD RT GPUs, so what are we even talking about? Niche feature everyone is jizzing over but like 1% of AMD userbase maybe gona use it. Even among high end nvidia users based on multiple polls done for example by HUB, most chose more performance over RT.",Negative
AMD,"lmao, again, watch some benchmarks. HW Lumen is far more taxing, but since you're so smart, surely won't have problems googling some benchmarks",Neutral
AMD,This isn't a periodic demand spike anymore this may be all compute hardware and silicon for the next 10 years.,Neutral
AMD,Why does AMD get criticism for simply following the market standards that Nvidia and their ilk established?,Neutral
AMD,Feature parity with Nvidia while also providing more VRAM,Neutral
AMD,Not targeted to you specifically but that's been the obvious sentiment regarding this manufactured outrage,Neutral
AMD,"I can very much read, thank you.  9070 does fine in pretty much any RT title, benchmarks show as much. It beats the 5070 in RT, but also has enough VRAM to fully leverage the power it has available for heavy RT.  Your examples are Black myth: Wukong, AW2 and Indiana jones, and only with the most extreme RT settings. The most similarly priced Nvidia card, the 5070, performs worse in two of those three titles. In Wukong, where it's beating it, it's still delivering unplayable framerates due to the fast-paced nature of the game.  It should also be noted that your example benchmarks were produced on PRE-RELEASE DRIVERS. Those same prerelease drivers had launch FSR 4, which had a much higher latency penalty than it currently does. Current drivers have brought huge performance boosts, something like 10-15% over launch performance, even accounting for outliers.  Those performance gains have been especially big in RT games, where the base 9070 tends to beat the 5070 across the board now, while it was hit or miss at launch.  Like yes, the 5070Ti is still objectively better for RT than the 9070 XT, but it's also 25% more expensive. That still doesn't make the 9070 XT a slouch. It's still better than a 5070 in RT pretty much across the board, even where the 5070 isn't being strangled by the 12GB VRAM buffer.  Driver optimizations like opacity micromaps, shader execution reordering, neural radiance caching and an ML denoiser will only ever close that gap to the 5070 Ti further. Admittedly OMM and SER isn't hardware accelerated like on Nvidia hardware, but should still yield decent uplifts. NRC and ML denoising should both bring double digit performance uplifts, however.  People forget that on a pure hardware level, the 9070 XT has 5-10% more theoretical RT compute than the 5070 Ti. It just lacks the software feature set Nvidia has, and a few hardware-accelerated refinements, notably OMM and SER. It is not inconceivable that the 9070 XT could reach parity with the 5070 Ti in RT.",Positive
AMD,"I believe in the first 2 it's modified to even use hardware Lumen. As in the games don't ship with it supported nor did the developers put it in. And the last one is outer worlds 2. Which is known to run like garbage. Note the 50 to 60 fps with the GPU at 35 to 50% utilization.  I don't think these are representative of the overall usage of hardware RT.  Software Lumen tends to look very ghosty especially on foilage and lacks detail, especially in AO.  It's also screen space limited.",Negative
AMD,"Time to bring the receipts.  Software Lumen: [performance2-3840-2160.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance2-3840-2160.png)   Hardware Lumen: [performance-3840-2160.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance-3840-2160.png)  A whopping 7% drop in performance for hardware Lumen on a 5090. Thanks for the example. It illustrates very well what I'm talking about. From what I've heard the hardware Lumen in The Outer Worlds 2 is broken but usually it looks significantly better than software Lumen. I think most people would gladly sacrifice 7% performance for that, because usually the difference is like low vs ultra graphics. No massive Lumen ghosting either.  It's funny you talk about AMD not being good at RT but in this game a 9070xt loses less performance than Nvidia: [performance-2560-1440.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance-2560-1440.png) vs [performance2-2560-1440.png (560×1450)](https://tpucdn.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-performance-benchmark/images/performance2-2560-1440.png) so they're losing 3% performance at 1440P.  It's not that RT doesn't cost a lot of performance it's just that software Lumen is just as expensive as it's wildly inefficient. The 5090 does indeed struggle at native 4K, but it struggles in general and hardware Lumen has nothing to do with it. With how dominant UE5 is you can't actually avoid RT at all so it's funny that you call it a niche feature. It's like I'm arguing with someone from 2020.",Neutral
AMD,"They ALL get the critique, stop fucking bootlicking.",Negative
AMD,"I'm sorry lol, but that's insane. You think it's okay to pay more for software features on current GPUs?",Negative
AMD,"It's not proportional at all though. Nvidia has 94% of the market, the critique falls squarely on their shoulders.",Neutral
AMD,"That's my point though. Nvidia and the consumers decided it's okay to spend $600 on a xx70 GPU with 12GB of VRAM, but all of a sudden it's bad when AMD does it?",Negative
AMD,When they do it mid-generation on pre-existing cards? Absolutely.,Neutral
AMD,It's an existing card - how do you ever justify that lmao,Negative
AMD,"Yup! AMD is super efficient and in turn they are cooler, plus air coolers are really good too. AIOs are just for looks at this point tbh.",Positive
AMD,"very few people NEED water cooling, and 7800x3D is a long way from that need category.    90% of AIO cooling out there is for the cool factor, and if that makes them happy, awesome.  But dont get sucked into thinking its a necessity for most.",Positive
AMD,"I have the 7800X3D and i’m not a fan of watercooling so I went with Noctua NH-D15 and the case is Fractal Pop XL (silent black solid, not sure how many versions are) + 2x extra fans on top.  I usually get around 62-65C on both cpu and gpu in heavy load. In the worst case I have seen 70C but the room temp was above 25c and my rig is very close to the heater.  I’m not sure how a mid tower will handle the heat.",Negative
AMD,"The major difference between an air cooler and an AIO cooler is where the heat is dumped.    Assuming you have typical case fans for the Meshy 3 to move the hot air out of the case, you will be fine.",Neutral
AMD,"Of course, the thing uses like 70W in gaming...  It's nothing",Neutral
AMD,"Yes it is enough, I had exact cpu and cooler before. No issues. And that cooler actually performs very well.  Just checked the link and looks like that one is 140, I was using with 120 so even better.",Positive

AMD,"Yep, I have the Phantom Spirit, which is almost identical, and it works well. My idle temps hover in the 30-42°C range, non hotspot under load sits around 48-55°C, and my hotspot in games, caps at around 75-80°C at full load. Synthetic benchmarks can have the hotspot reaching 82-84C°.",Positive

AMD,Thanks last time I built a PC was before the liquid cooling was a thing so air coolers all the way for me!,Positive
AMD,You shouldnt need an AIO at all with a CPU that barely hits 80watts under a full synthetic load.   $30 Peerless Assassin is more than enough for the 7800X3D.,Neutral
AMD,"No, you don't. All that air coming in will get pushed out by the pressure just fine unless you block the flow with something.  I use a Phantom Spirit Evo in a Meshify 3 with a 9800X3D and it's basically impossible to get it hot enough to even need to think about it. And that's with the front case fans turned down from stock.  Do note that it doesn't have a fine dust filter on the front intakes.",Negative
AMD,Should be fine.,Positive

DDR5 is just so stupendously expensive it hardly makes sense to get it in terms of value if you already have 32GB of decent DDR4. AM4 is just as dead as LGA 1700, and the 14600K performs pretty great, even with DDR4 better than a 5700X3D in most games.   Make sure to get a decent DDR4 board, make sure it's on the latest bios, and you should be done for around 300 EUR/$300. Less than the cost of JUST 32GB of DDR5.

AMD,"AMD.  AM5 will support at CPUs to at least Zen 6.  That platform has a long life.  If you go with Intel, no upgrade path to future CPUs - you’re stuck with 14th gen as the only upgrade path.  I made the mistake of building my last rig using Intel, thinking I can always upgrade to the best 11th gen but new CPUs in 12th, 13th, 14th gen are even cheaper than equivalent 11th gen retail with updated features and the used market are charging near retail for old tech.",Neutral
AMD,"Second build because it gets you on AM5, both have shit GPUs.",Negative
AMD,If they are the same price AMD platform for sure.,Neutral
AMD,"If you can, AMD because it's a newer system and will upgrade better. The next generation of AMD processors will likely be a significant leap above current (30-40% after IPC, boost and other optimizations) and will hopefully be a drop in replacement. Buy once so you don't have to buy again.",Positive
AMD,Amd for this particular scenario.,Neutral
AMD,"The 13600 is a fine cpu but at equal price, the 9600X is the better value.   I would expect there to be a minimum $125 or so difference (intel costing less) due to DDR4. You are being overcharged somewhere.   Also, stay away from Asrock AM5 boards. There is something strange going on which probably doesn't effect the 9600x but you can never be sure.",Neutral
AMD,AMD,Neutral
AMD,AMD build but swap out the ASRock motherboard. I’ve read that they cause issues with Ryzen CPUs,Negative
AMD,If this is for gaming go with 7800X3D or 9800X3D CPU.,Neutral
AMD,The AMD one is fine but I would change that GPU for one from Nvidia,Positive
AMD,"Yeah but cooler, mobo, and cpu are more expensive so it kind of evens out.",Neutral
AMD,Planning to upgrade as soon as I can from that gpu.,Positive
AMD,"I have heard too, but I'm pretty sure that is with the X3D COUs.  Also I plan to get the build in a month or two, and I'm hoping by that time that the issue is fixed.",Neutral
AMD,Are you 13yo?,Neutral
AMD,If you already have the GPU roll with it until it's not enough. If you're buying that GPU as a holdover just don't. Get at least like a 9060xt 16gb.,Neutral
AMD,"A month or two.. are you *certain* prices won't change, that you'll still be able to get the systems as configured? I would be very surprised, even astonished if that was the case.",Negative
AMD,"As far as I can tell, this is a rumor based on a few anecdotes anyway. Nobody has been able to recreate the issue in a controlled environment.",Negative
AMD,well just have to wait and see.,Neutral
AMD,"Of course! If you absolutely can’t buy now, then you can’t. I was just hoping you had some flexibility there with your budget, so that you could move faster and grab that deal, is all.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, all the flexibility in my budget has already been 'flexxed' to its max, and I really can't buy now, as I'm not buying myself, my parents are getting it for me, and having a very flexible budget there is tough.",Negative
AMD,"Understood. It’s just unfortunate timing is all. For a lot of people, I’m sure.",Negative
AMD,You aren't actually replacing a GPU.  You are installing one into a system that doesn't have a GPU.,Neutral
AMD,The 5600GT is a CPU. The RTX 3060 is a GPU.  What exactly are you trying to do?  You can link photos from a hosting site like imgur.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware but looking at my specs there is no graphics card listed anywhere, all it says is AMD Ryzen 5600gt with Radeon Graphics. And looking inside my PC the areas where you plug into the graphics card are directly connected to the motherboard rather than a graphics card",Neutral
AMD,"The 5600GT has integrated graphics.  All you need to do is install the new GPU, connect your monitor to it, then install the Nvidia drivers.",Neutral
AMD,"The CPU has a shitty little GPU inside of it. If you want a GPU, you need to make sure your PSU can power it properly.",Neutral
AMD,That's good to know but the monitor connection thing connects directly into the motherboard. Is that gonna be an issue?,Neutral
AMD,> monitor connection thing  The video port? Like HDMI or Displayport?   You'll use the ports on the RTX 3060 instead.,Neutral
AMD,"Once you install your new GPU, you'll want to use the monitor connection ports on the GPU, not the motherboard's.",Neutral
AMD,"Plug your display cable into the GPU once installed, then download drivers from nvidia's website.",Neutral
AMD,"These were my 2 options as well, I decided to go with the 5060 ti, yes the 5060 ti is usually a bit more expensive for just a bit more performance but in my opinion I feel like the 5060 will be more reliable in the future, with the dlss etc. both are great cards, and I think because your on the am4 the difference between each one won’t really matter, just buy the one which is the best price at the moment",Positive
AMD,"Get a 5700x3d put one in my brothers PC it's a beast, and the b580 is quite competitive if your rocking pcie 4.0",Positive
AMD,"I just upgraded my 3600 to a 5700x and I'm a happy camper. I paired it with a 7700xt, but that was before the 9060/70xt launched or I would have gotten that one. Similar performance though.",Positive
AMD,RDNA 4 is better than DLSS at the moment so take that what you will if you want to play at high resolutions.,Positive
AMD,"atm the difference in prices between 5060 ti (450€ + ) and rx 9060XT (387-400€)    I also really enjoy the nvidia interface, control panel and im generally used to nvidia but they're expensive as f...",Positive
AMD,issue with that cpu is that its either 400+€ or out of stock 98% of the time   i'v been on 4+ websites and checked the notification if it comes back in stock  \^that was 3 months ago,Negative
AMD,That cpu is no longer budgetable.. Use to be.. But that it shot up like a rocket  It's more than twice the price of a 5700x,Negative
AMD,"> I also really enjoy the nvidia interface, control panel  lol thats like the 1 place where nvidia gets trounced",Positive
AMD,"If that’s the case then the 5060ti may be the better option for you, the GPU might be with you for a long time so if you ever decide to upgrade to am5 take that into account as well. Paying a bit more for the 5060ti might not sound as bad in the long term",Positive
AMD,Sorry! That stinks,Negative
AMD,"I gonna say, your pc is alright for 1080p for height end gaming and some 1440p games",Positive
AMD,That's defiantly a PC.,Neutral
AMD,Sensible build in today's economy imo.  This is basically the build I would do right now if I wasn't trying to wait for AM6.,Positive
AMD,"I'd avoid ASRock still, they have been killing 9000(X3D) CPUs and while it's allegedly been fixed (several times now) I wouldn't risk it, in case you ever want to upgrade your CPU. There should be plenty of choice within your budget. Should be fine with 7000 CPUs though.  Not familiar with that PSU but rest looks solid. Hope you got that RAM for a good price. :')",Negative
AMD,"Using PcPartPicker can help you get a better overall view of your build and let others suggest changes, but besides that, without knowing your budget or what you are going to be using it for that's a fairly reasonable build.",Positive
AMD,"Thanks, just what I was hoping for with this.",Positive
AMD,defiantly :),Neutral
AMD,"Thanks, that's what I was going for and with a path for upgradability for the GPU and CPU in the future if required.",Positive
AMD,"I got a good deal for the motherboard with type C and wifi and the reviews seemed alright I was hoping to upgrade the CPU to the 9000 series a few years later. Fingers crossed.     Regarding the PSU, it's a B- rated PSU as per this PSU tier list - [SPL's PSU Tier List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akCHL7Vhzk_EhrpIGkz8zTEvYfLDcaSpZRB6Xt6JWkc/)     The RAM costed me $208.27.

Glad I did not wait further for it.     Thanks!",Positive
AMD,"A 2x32 kit would be extremely overkill for your setup. Unless you plan to upgrade your AM4 platform to something like a 5700x3d later on, I'd probably recommend just a 2x8 kit to hold you over until a platform upgrade. Second-hand would be your best bet most likely to find a decent price.",Neutral
AMD,How many slot u have in mobo? Not worth getting 64gb of ddr4 unless u doing intensive work like ai stuff.  Most gamers not even exceed use of 32gb.  And do u know ram price sky rocket recently?  U should get 16x2 gb (32gb) would be enough,Negative
AMD,Some Ryzen boards do no work well with 4 RAM sticks.,Neutral
AMD,price/performance ratio of 64 gb for any task right now is unbalanced.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you! but just to clarify you mean overkill as in price right? not that it would offer any performance drawbacks.      that's why you said unless I plan to upgrade it wouldn't be worth it correct? sorry just making sure,Neutral
AMD,"Thank you for the reply I have 4 slots and your right, I probably dont even need the space, but just to make sure when you say 'most gamers dont exceed 32gb' what games are you talking about? My 8gb ram struggles to run larger scale games or modpacks and im totally new to this sort of stuff.",Neutral
AMD,"Correct. Having 64 GB of ram wouldn't hurt anything, but it likely wouldn't produce any meaningful performance improvements in games, even for very high end systems. Now if you do think you might upgrade your CPU to a faster part (like a 5700x3d), then it could be worth getting a 2x16 kit now. But if you think your next upgrade would be to a DDR5 platform, then I'd say that 16 gigs should be a good match for your current setup anyway.  Now obviously if you find a really good deal on a 32 GB kit, then by all means go with that.",Neutral
AMD,"I have two 16 GB for 32, and I barely feel any better than I did with 16.  I imagine moving from 32 to 64 would be even less.",Negative
AMD,"There’s only a handful of games that use more than 32gb ram. Microsoft Flight Simulator and Star Citizen are the only ones that come to mind honestly. Or VR games.  Also keep in mind if you build a new computer on a new platform you won’t be able to use those sticks for something else. Given it’s an old platform, I wouldn’t invest too much in the ram and probably start saving for a full system upgrade. Ram has gotten very expensive recently. I’d just grab another 8gb stick for now.",Neutral
AMD,"32 GB is more than enough. DDR4 prices are going up but thankfully not as extreme as DDR5. Look for a 2x16GB kit although 4x8GB would most likely also work, just not at as high RAM speeds as 2x16GB. 4 sticks of RAM add ever so slightly more latency and at XMP settings some motherboards don't like it. I have 4 sticks in my AM4 motherboard and it works fine, depends on both the RAM and board. If you go to the manufacturer's website and find the support page for your motherboard, there is a Memory QVL ""qualified vendor list"" and you will see they have extensively tested specific kits in their board. To the side you will see columns marked ""1, 2, 4""...if there's a check mark in ""4"", you can run 4 sticks of that RAM type/speed and it will be 99% guaranteed to work. It's usually only a problem at higher speeds. High speed=more stress on memory controller.",Neutral
AMD,thanks for the comments guys! i found a promo and decided to buy 5600 for $67,Positive
AMD,5600 or 5600x or 5700x The extra L3 cache that the 5500 lacks makes a massive difference,Neutral
AMD,"5500 is good but it is cheap for a reason; it has less L3 cache / reduced PCIE lane support vs 5600, so there's actual reduction in gaming performance difference vs 5600.  So unless you absolutely can't spare more $, it's recommended to go with 5600 esp considering you seem to intend to use your PC for several years.",Positive
AMD,grab the 5600 if possible. The doubled L3 cache over the 5500 help a lot in gaming. However if the price different between them is too much then the 5500 is perfectly fine.,Neutral
AMD,I grabbed a R5 3600 (which is very similar in performance to the 5500) for my own budget build with the exact same card as you. It still kicks ass at 1080p. If you throw in some frame gen (lossless scaling is my favorite) you'll be able to stretch it even further.   R5 5500 is a solid CPU. I just chose the 3600 for the L3 cache,Positive
AMD,"5600 bumps the system into full pcie4 though, which if the rest of the components are configured well will make quite a potent machine .. but im sure a 5500 would run things",Neutral
AMD,"Definitely. If you're gaming on a budget, and don't really wanna get the best entry level GPUs like the 9060/RTX5060, then its still a solid choice. I looked it up as well, and the 5600 is double the price in some areas, so you'd do better getting the 5500",Positive
AMD,Yes at 1080p,Neutral
AMD,"5500 is still a great budget CPU, the value can't really be beat. Yes the 5600(x)/5700X/5800x(t) offer better performance but with a higher price tag",Positive
AMD,"Dude some those CPUs aren't even available anymore. And even for the ones still available, the price is usually double that of the 5500 WHILE USED, or more when you consider the 5700X. The Ryzen 5 5500 is 99 CAD, its literally the best value AMD 6 core CPU on the market :/  Who cares if it has half the cache? budget people look for a good deal, not double the cache for double the price. Also richie McRicherson, if they're gonna spend over 200CAD on a 5th gen ryzen CPU, they might as well get a Ryzen 5 9600X since those things are no longer a horrible 399CAD value at this point",Negative
AMD,5600 and 5800xt both in stock on Amazon.,Neutral
AMD,"Ok and?? neither of them are at budget prices. The 5800XT is 290CAD, while the 5500 is 99CAD right now. OP is looking for a budget",Neutral
AMD,"He's also looking for gaming, and having cut down cache is massively detrimental in this case. You also have to look at value and budget in context of the whole system, not just at component level. An extra $100 is double on the CPU sure, but if you're spending say $500, a 20% increase for the extra cashe is much more worth it, especially as it will actually add about that much performance.",Neutral
AMD,Only the 5800X3D or 5700X3D would be a noticeable upgrade for games but they're getting more expensive and harder to find.,Negative
AMD,Ryzen 9 5950X for productivity.  Ryzen 7 5800X3D for gaming.  Might need to up your cooler for either.  I'm finding the 5700x to be the sweet spot for me in terms of price/performance/thermals.,Positive
AMD,If it's one you can actually buy new today it's the 5800x. There's no 5 series X3D chips available anywhere.,Neutral
AMD,5700/5800x3D if you can find 2nd hand somewhere,Neutral
AMD,You can find a 5800x and have a cooler to handle 105w power then it'll be a boost too with prices still reasonable,Neutral
AMD,I just upgraded from a 3600 to a 5800XT to extend the life of my AM4 system. Noticable improvement,Neutral
AMD,"5800xt not that much more then a 5700x, I would get a cheap thermal right cooler if your running a stock cooler though.",Neutral
AMD,"Rocking a 5950X (replaced a 2700X build), with 48 GB and artic liquid cooler. Overkill for my usage. No complaints !",Neutral
AMD,For productivity: higher the better For gaming: 5800x3d,Positive
AMD,"Try and find a used/refurbished 5700x3D or 5800x3d, otherwise better off saving your money unless you're video editing or similar.",Neutral
AMD,5700x with 9070xt. Seems to run everything.  I waiting for 57/5800x3d but I might be waiting for a while,Neutral
AMD,"If you also do streaming, editing, or heavy multitasking, the 5900X or 5950X are worth it. More cores and threads will actually make a difference in real world workloads",Neutral
AMD,If you can't find a 5700/5800X3D then the 5800XT  Have you already maxed your current chip and memory with overclocking?,Neutral
AMD,"What GPU are you running that a 5600x is bottlenecking you? The only CPU that will get you a massive performance uplift is an X3D chip, but they're end-of-life, except for the 5500X3D in LATAM. So you'll need to look for a second hand 5700X3D or 5800X3D. Alternatively, you can alleviate most of the bottleneck by simply switching to 1440p instead of 1080p.",Neutral
AMD,Productivity: 5950x   Gaming: 5800x3d or 5700x3d   Low idle power or iGPU for lossless scaling: 5700g  The 5700g can be your niche budget banger if you use the iGPU to do Lossless Scaling frame gen. The main issue is the PCIe lane cutdown makes it a flop for productivity.,Positive
AMD,"Save your money for an AM5 build. I did the 5600x to 5700x3d upgrade last year. Although it heavily depends what games you play, I feel performance uplift was not justified even for an easy $230 upgrade. I ended up giving the 5700x3d to a friend and doing a 9800x3d build and using my 5600x for a spare build.",Neutral
AMD,Kinda sucks that I was looking to upgrade my 3600  to the best AM4 deal I could find within the next year.  Now it looks like more people might be forced into the same situation instead of buying AM5.  Any chance that AMD could decide to make some more of those AM4 X3D cpus now?,Negative
AMD,"They don’t make these chips anymore. The current supply is already a little pricey, I had to replace my 5800x on my streaming rig and it cost around the same at the mid range 7000 and 9000 series chips.  With the absurd price of RAM, I wouldn’t be surprised if the chips go up in price as people are trying to avoid DDR5 prices.",Negative

AMD,None of these are on the market,Neutral
AMD,"5800X3D hasn't been on the market for more than a year. It was replaced by the 5700X3D, but that is also EOL as off a few months ago.",Neutral
AMD,"5700X for me also, gaming and productivity balanced. If gaming focus probab;y 5600X3D would be perfect if you could found one",Positive
AMD,The 5800XT is pretty great for the money as well. $140 on sale,Positive
AMD,"The 5800xt is cheaper right now by a lot and I guess marginally better than the 5700x (based off 2 seconds of google. Looks like a base speed difference and the 5700x is higher than 5800 but both have the same OC speed?). Not sure why it's so much cheaper right now though. And the 5800xt has the cooler come with it while the 5700x doesn't, as far as Amazon shows anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah the 5700x is still selling strong, though I'm biding my time for a price on a 16 core lol, I don't even care if it's used at this point I just want to tie a bow on the build and start planning something new for later.   Need a gimmick though, maybe something with CAMM2",Positive

AMD,Yeah I tried finding either a 5700x3d or 5800x3d new at a reasonable price. Even used they're crazy expensive. So I settled for a 5800xt which was about as best as I could get without doubling my expenditure. Even looking at the price history for that I paid 183 which is more than it cost even 6 months ago.

AMD,"People are suggesting a 5700/5800x3d because OP has an AM4 motherboard already and wants a CPU upgrade using that same motherboard.    The 7800x3d is a better CPU, and there will be much better upgrade potential in the future because AM5.   A 7800x3d with a 9070XT will last you a long time so don't worry about it.",Positive

AMD,"I haven't, I got a be quiet slim pro rock 2 cooler which is kinda meh but I have a mATX case and RGB ram so I was really worried about clearance. also my first time doing a clip cooler instead of a screw one so I'm paranoid I didn't get my pasting perfect.  I booted up a cpu stress test and it did hit 90 like instantly so I turned it off.

AMD,"Yeah, there was definitely a point where the 5800X3D was a very good buy, but those days are long gone.  Still, with the current DDR5 crisis at play, it might still make more sense for someone on AM4 to buy a 5800X3D than upgrade to AM5 if they can find a relatively OK deal on one.",Neutral

AMD,Why not 7800X3D and 5070 ti ?,Neutral
AMD,"if you are looking for a mostly gaming rig, i'd go with a 7800x3d and a 9070xt, since this combo has the best price to performance (depends where you live, but i believe that in most places that is correct)   9070xt is just a tad slower than the 5070ti and has a reasonable price gap (again, depends on where you live). same thing with the 7800x3d x 9800x3d debate.",Positive

AMD,"I mean you can throw in a 5090 if you want, depends what you do with it",Neutral
AMD,"You can always go bigger, especially if you play on high resolution or high settings.  There's just diminishing returns till you upgrade the CPU as well.",Positive
AMD,They’re more expensive and have less vram,Negative
AMD,"Get a 2K monitor with above 120Hz and then with the rest buy the 6750xt or 7700xt or a second hand 3080 or something about that range. I have similar specs but intel and have a second hand 6900xt.  If you want to stay at 1080, then get just the card. But limit the fps to like 160-200.",Neutral
AMD,For 1080p a 9060XT should be sufficient and anything better than that will be bottlenecked by your 5600G,Positive
AMD,9060xt will be amazing for you,Positive
AMD,"What do you want to play, I saw someone else say it, but you could go for a 9060xt or even push to a 9070/5070, cause in some cases you will be CPU bottleneck and in some other not",Neutral
AMD,"Oops, I saw this comment second, then I'd say go for a 9060xt cause these games a relatively more CPU bound than GPU, you can spend excess money on a CPU",Neutral
AMD,"thanks for the advice ! and from what i saw the 9060XT  is better value for money for me and they are very close with 7700 XT performance wise , also the thing that bothered me is i was about to purchase the 7700 xt last year and its price went up at least 70 euros",Positive
AMD,Get the 16GB variant!,Neutral
AMD,"Great price to performance build. Not really any weak spots anywhere, but there are a few places you could save some money.   Don't worry about CL30 with the current market, CL32 is indistinguishable from it. It its cheaper just get that  The 990 Pro is a great SSD dont get me wrong, but you will get almost zero noticeable impact from a drive that $50-70 less than it. I would downgrade to something like the 990 Evo or the WD black 7100  The 4000D is also a great case, personally though I am not a fan of the expensive and restrictive Corsair iCue ecosystem. Given there is no other corsair parts in this build I would grab a cheaper option that has cheaper, open source RGB options, like Montech for example.   Other than those couple things, nice build, it should work well for you :)",Positive
AMD,"Well, for that price it's a pretty good build. Of course the 7800X3D offers a much better price/performance ratio, but that's super cheap regardless. Enjoy.",Positive
AMD,"Thanks for the feedback, I bought the cpu and the ssd for 500 euros on a Facebook marketplace deal, both are sealed so i saved some money on this deal",Positive
AMD,"That's a pretty great deal, you almost got the 990 pro for free.   Good find :)",Positive
AMD,"It would be helpful to know your motherboard & CPU as that will tell us your PCIe revision for M.2 drives, and how many M.2 slots you have.   In regards to buying Crucial or not at this time - I like only needing one SSD firmware program vs having multiple on my computer. Crucial is a decent brand, and in their press release they said they were continuing product support, just ending manufacturing.   Beware that Crucial make SSDs at every price point - a Crucial P3 is nowhere near as good as a Crucial T500, for example. Main things to look out for are TLC NAND (QLC is cheaper but lower endurance), and whether you want DRAM cache - it's nice to have but not strictly necessary.   Crucial had a great deal on the T705 and T710 SSDs the last past couple of weeks - I'm sorry you missed it.",Neutral
AMD,"Company doesn’t rly matter in my opinion, I just look price/capacity/speeds. Instead of company, I’d make sure to buy from Newegg or Amazon so the customer service is good, and maybe even warranty for extra safety. If you wanna go cheap, 500gb nvme ssd for os would go a long way: I have 150gb on my os nvme drive and 800gb on my 2nd drive with my games. Totally suggest it if ur already familiar with >1 drive",Neutral
AMD,"I had a feeling that might've been the case. I'll also add it to the post.  CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D  Motherboard: Gigabyte X570S Aorus Pro AX  Ah, I didn't realise they were continuing support. I read they were ending manufacturing and assumed support was ending too.",Neutral
AMD,Honestly don’t see the purpose in a bigger main drive,Negative
AMD,"I haven't bought PC parts through Amazon before and I don't know if Newegg even ship to Australia. I'd most likely go through the same company (Scorptec) I've been using for the last few years.  At this stage, I definitely want to get a 500GB of some sort as an upgrade to my main drive (OS, various other bits and pieces) and have at least one 4TB for extra storage. My two 2TB still have a bit of space left (One has 100GB, the other is just shy of 210GB).",Neutral
AMD,"Nice top of the line AM4 build there, PCIe 4.0 on all three M.2 slots.   So if you're staying with Crucial, The T500 is going to be your go to here depending on the price / availability in your region. High end PCIe 4.0 drive with DRAM cache.   The T700 / T705 / T710 would be worth picking up if they're not anymore expensive than a T500, though note these PCIe 5.0 drives will run at PCIe 4.0 on your system.   Avoid any Crucial P ### drive, like the P510 as they are QLC NAND.   Alternatives abound, Samsung 990 Pro is a go to for a top of the line PCIe 4.0 with DRAM cache. Might be cheaper in your area.",Neutral

AMD,"5700x3d for gaming, non x3d chips don’t make sense except if you’re on a tight budget or the chips aren’t available in your area (example : 7600x3d is cheap but not widely available).",Negative
AMD,"x3d for gaming as it has the extra cache  If you mainly use your pc for gaming that is the way to go, unless you're doing some crazy cpu hungry tasks as your 'work' (and I do mean crazy) the 5950x isn't worth considering.  The 5700x3d still has 8 cores/16 threads and will be very good at cpu heavy tasks",Neutral
AMD,I got the 5700x3d last Christmas and it’s a beast  Every AAA game 1440p no problem,Positive
AMD,I upgraded my Ryzen 5600 to a Ryzen 5800 XT as I was able to get a pretty good deal on one at $129.  These days they are going more for retail/full price over the holidays.  I bought mine pretty close to release when they had alot laying around and the market had no GPUs.  I did the same for 64GB RAM for $99.  This market is crazy.  Anyway a Zen3 8 core is a plenty good CPU.  Any of the Ryzen 5700/5800 series is basically the same CPU.  Mine does 5.15Ghz but sucks down 1.5v and seems unsafe even though its apparently the FinFet max.  So I run mine like 4.9Ghz eco mode which does around 4.2-4.4Ghz all core for 65watts.  I've realized basically all the Zen3s are VERY similar.  They're going to be doing like 4.7-4.8Ghz single core+/- 200Mhz or like 4.2-4.8Ghz all core depending on cooling/power budget.  Find the best deal on a Zen3 and you should be good for awhile.,Positive
AMD,5950x can still play games pretty well.,Positive
AMD,5700X3D for gaming wins all the time...,Positive
AMD,7800x3d,Neutral
AMD,"Okok, thanks for the replies.  Now let's say that the 5950x is cheaper. Is the X3D that much better to justify it? Because the 5950x as a lot of good things to go for, even if is worse for gaming.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, I remember finding 5700X3D under 190€ like 1 year ago... If I only did know the shitstorm that was gonna hit the pc market...",Negative
AMD,That's a whole new build.,Neutral
AMD,5950x will be faster in games that don't take advantage of the x3d due to higher clock speed. 5950x also runs hotter as well. I think the 5700x3d ages better    What games do u play in particular?,Positive
AMD,"I play mainly 3A games, like Monster Hunter, Elden Ring, and some single player games like Cyberpunk.  Rarely I play competitive games, such as CS, OW, and Valorant.  My main objective is using my 3060ti at full potential in heavier games at 1080p, while futureproofing for a long time (beacause I aint buying ddr5 ram anytime soon).",Neutral
AMD,All those game can use the x3d cache. The games the 5700x3d perform worst on would be things like Microsoft flight simulator for example.,Negative
AMD,MSFS loves x3d. But of course it doesn't do as well as the faster x3d it appears.   https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-review?page=3,Neutral
AMD,"I'd be worried and check my AIO settings/repaste/etc.  The temperature sensor has some inertia, so the actual temperature might be even higher for a moment. This shouldn't cause damage, but...  Official max is around 95° except for x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"On AM5 Ryzen CPUs, AIOs struggle with temp spikes. If it's not sustained, it's not a problem.",Negative
AMD,"Even if it's a fast spike?  Sadly the pc is on my gf's pc, she doesn't have the patience to monitor it like she should. But I'll keep an eye on that.",Negative
AMD,It's physics. At this temperature nothing should melt. But it's like running car engine in red zone. Technically it can. For some time. And with service every 2K KM instead of every 15K KM.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm contacting the store that built the pc. Right now it's too cheap, so I asked for a built already computer + the price of pc parts. But didn't like to see this temp.  It's missing the extractor fan.

AMD,It's funny how different the reactions are here when AMD does it compared to Intel.,Neutral
AMD,"Fuck it, let’s let the industry crash then. We all likely own enough games and gaming devices (Steam Decks, gaming PCs/laptops, even SBC gaming devices like Retroid or Anbernic etc) to play our vast libraries of games. So let’s just stop spending money upgrading so we can play the newest AI drivel and just enjoy what we already have. Let’s play through our backlogs and even revisit retro games of our childhood, we’ve got enough to play.    When the industry as a whole begins to lose money because nobody wants to be gouged repeatedly on hardware, software, and subscriptions just to play the latest slop then they’ll reverse course.",Neutral
AMD,"Realy hope that the AI bubble pop heavily enough. But not yet, big Tech need to stack more unusable hardware.  If i could get a used cheap a Radeon AI PRO R9700 which is literaly a 9070 XT with 32gb of vram.   I would really consider it as a side upgrade of my 7900 XT.  The price increase is definitely coming as a result of TSMC wafer price that increased heavily as the demand as exploded equally to dram.  CPU-wise my 12600k will get the job done until the end of AM5 or early AM6. Who know i may end up with a intel x3d chips when i am going to realy need it.  CPU last way longer that before now. A signly price increase dont feel much of a issue for something that people may old into for a whole decade.  i put 50 buck a month on a saving account for PC hardware stuff as its my main hobbies, been a while now that its hard to justify any purchase.

AMD,"Thankfully and also unfortunately I'm gaming less and less every day, I don't consider myself old but I'm getting tired more easily and I'd rather unwind watching something than gaming these days.   That all being said, I still love the dance before building a new rig, watching reviews, comparing prices, using PCPP to check that everything will fit, go to the subreddits to get opinions, pull the trigger, wait for the hardware to arrive, take my Saturday to put it together and fire it up for the first time is the closest I'll have to having a child.   But now every time I try to juggle the parts list and the prices it makes no damn sense to upgrade. I don't even really need to it's just my love for building rigs and passing down my old ones to my brother or other family members.   I was waiting for the end of the year to do it but with RAM prices having gone through the roof it makes no sense at all, like I was counting on getting a normal 6000Mhz CL30 kit, they were going for 120/140 bucks, now they're over 300 or more.   Heck I almost bought a 2x24GB 6000Mhz CL26 kit for 320 bucks three months ago to call it a day and I chickened out thinking they would get cheaper lol.   I remember this happened with DDR4 around 2018 or so, but the prices were still somewhat acceptable, like a good kit was around 90/110 and they went to 180/200. Expensive, but not deal breakers.

But even then I avoided the worst of the price hike.  Paid $240 for 32 gb of 6000 CL30 beginning of November.  Same kit costs $480 now.  Prices are going to be nutty when the Ram spike and subsequent shortage settles and trickles down to GPUs, prebuilts, etc along with whatever tariff bullshit Trump is doing.",Negative

AMD,"Or maybe they just don't drop price at all and keep it like that forever, just like how Nvidia did GPU.",Neutral
AMD,to be fair anyone who's building a gaming PC and putting up with these ram prices won't bat an eye at an extra 10-15% CPU cost,Negative
AMD,"I don’t think that’s the idea because CPU prices aren’t going to drop back down unless RAM prices do to. Anyone buying a new CPU has to also buy RAM, so CPUs aren’t going to sell much more just because they’re cheaper if RAM prices aren’t the bottleneck.  I think it’s more likely that they recognize that overall sales will go down due to RAM costs, and anyone looking to buy a CPU in the next few years will be less price sensitive since they’re willing to shell out for RAM. I’d imagine they’re doing this then to offset the lower volume.",Neutral
AMD,"It helps compensate for lower sales volume. If you know demand for your product is relatively inelastic you can increase your prices in the face of market headwinds to make greater margin at reduced volume. It does leave you open to being undercut by your competitors, but AMD is so far ahead in CPU right now that they might feel they can take the risk.",Neutral

AMD,"A year ago, I purchased a 32 GB memory upgrade for my PC that cost me $83, that kit cost $300 now.",Negative
AMD,"No clue what you are talking about. GPUs have usually been the most expensive parts.  Why are people even downvoting this? A 7500F system went from 350-400$ to spending close to that ON THE RAM ALONE. So entry level AM5 can cost about $600 right now. People who can't afford this, will just not upgrade, i.e. not buy CPUs. Meaning: Sales go down.  GPUs have no direct relation to ANY other part prices, so I have no clue what they mean with their comment. You can upgrade your GPU as long as your PC has a PCIe slot and a good enough PSU. And even GPUs in full systems are barely affected because a $2k being 10% more expensive due to RAM is much less relevant than a 50% increase on your individual CPU upgrade.",Negative
AMD,"Well, it reduces the amount of buyers. And fewer buyers -> more stock -> lower prices. So it goes up by 10-15% due to AMD and then down due to supply.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, that is what I meant: They raise prices to compensate for the expected losses in sales. Practically speaking, they are making the retailers pay for their losses in sales volume, because CPU pricing is directly related to the RAM pricing.  Sure, that might just be $20-30 out of $600 total for your upgrade, but you'll still see an overall effect on the purchases. For a single person, it might not matter much to spend 20 bucks more, but in terms of the whole market, even small average price increases will show up in sales.  And keep in mind - Intel might be down atm, but they still exists and compete - and they'll potentially release their new architecture next year. So this is not just AMD increasing prices in a vacuum. The Ultra 235 is already contesting with 9700X and 7700X, the Ultra 225 with the 9600X and 7600X.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD isn't actually that far ahead. Non-X3D CPUs are head-to-head with Intel, if not worse in terms of value. That's just something that people aren't really talking about that much.  Intel has flown under the radar since the whole 13th/14th gen disaster, but they are far from dead. Even Apple is apparently going to produce some of their M-chips with Intel's new production process. Of course, it is hard to make any guesses of what this will actually mean for Intel's competition with AMD, but I really don't think it is as clear-cut as many people on this sub assume it is.",Neutral

Median income has however only increased by 3% since 2017. So relatively speaking GPU prices have increased even more disproportionately.  Also it should be pointed out that nvidia has since shifted the model stack a tier down. The 1080 Ti was the same die as the Titan. The 3080 was on the same die as the 3090. The 80 series was *very much* closer in performance to the halo card.   Now the 5080 is more comparable to what a 1070 was back in 2017 or a 3070 in 2020.

AMD,"[Here ](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/inflation_prices_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp)you got a source. As you can see, besides the flagship performance, pricing isn't actually that bad. And realistically, the flagship is of no real relevance for the typical gamer (and isn't really always comparable because flagship performance is really just what Nvidia choose it to be due to their monopoly on the high-end).  This is offtopic, though. Not even sure why I get downvoted for pointing that out.   GPU pricing is barely affected by other parts because it is the most expensive compent in like 90% of cases. If you buy a $2k build, $100-200 more sucks, but that isn't gonna change much about you having $2k to spend.  CPUs, on the other hand, are directly affected by RAM and mainboard pricing - and if RAM suddenly costs $100-200 more, then your CPU upgrade costs that much more. Especially for budget builds, that is easily 30-50% of the price.",Neutral
AMD,Fair point.,Neutral

AMD,Can't question the money proposition there. I just think it depends on what your use case/needs are. I cancelled my PS subscription because I stopped using my PS5 for online games.

AMD,">The 1080 Ti was the same die as the Titan. The 3080 was on the same die as the 3090. The 80 series was *very much* closer in performance to the halo card.   Now the 5080 is more comparable to what a 1070 was back in 2017 or a 1070 in 2020.   Yeah, we're getting some real shrinkflation from Nvidia's newer cards. The 80 class is effectively extinct. The 80 Ti used to provide performance within spitting distance of the current gen 90/Titan class cards for a fraction of the price, and the regular 80s weren't far behind. There is no card in the 50 series lineup that matches either description.  The 5080 is definitely the worst 80 class card of all time. It's not meaningfully better than the 5070 Ti, and to my knowledge it's the only 80 class card that does not beat or even match the performance of the previous generation's 90/Titan class.  It is more accurate to call it a 70 class, but shit, 70 class cards as recent as 4070 Super traded blows with the 3090. You can't even say that about the 5080 and the 4090.",Neutral
AMD,"And then you look at the 1080 which is $808 MSRP with inflation but for only 10-15% performance increase instead of 50% and compare that to the 5070 Ti at $749 MSRP with 30% performance increase (over the respective 70 models). So 50 series is way better value here.  With the 5080 you also compared a release card of the 50 series to a card that released a year after the 10 series came out originally. So 1080 Ti pricing should be closer to the (now delayed) 5080/5070Ti Super, if anything.  You need to look at the overall picture. Don't just pick the data that fits your conclusion. The overall picture is: Not much has changed. Nvidia specifically has some more agency over pricing due to their AI quasi-monopoly, but for gaming, it really isn't that bad atm.",Neutral
AMD,"Thing is 1080ti was on the titan die, so it was a downscaled flagship, part of the reason it's remained relevant for so long.",Neutral

AMD,"As a long time gooner, gamer and heavy drug coomer. I will say weed is probably one of the most powerful drugs ever.

Irritability, emotional instability, depression and even suicidal tendencies. Some research suggests it will lower your testosterone.

The 5080 is the only 80 class card to not beat or even match the previous generation's 90/Titan class. Fact.  There is no longer a product offering that provides performance within spitting distance of the 90/Titan class card. Fact.  >So if you claim that the 70 is good, then 80 just got better.  I never claimed that at all, don't put words in my mouth.  The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation. You bringing up the 5070 stat is meaningless, especially when the 5070 is only about as good as the last generation 4070 Super. It fails to even beat the 4070 Ti, when every other 70 class card before it was at least able to soundly beat the 70 Ti of the last generation.  Taking all of this into account, it's clear the utter lack of generational uplift on the 5070 is what's responsible for the 5080's growing lead. Insinuating that this is instead the result of 5080 being good value or providing good generational uplift rather than the 5070's failure to improve is completely disingenuous.  And we see this all across the 50 series' product lineup. The 5060 Ti 16 GB can't even beat the 4070, when the 3060 Ti was beating the 2080 Super. The 5060 can't even beat the 4060 Ti 8 GB, when the 3060 was beating the 2070. The 5070 Ti can at best match the 4080, when the 4070 Ti was beating the 3090.  And all this is corroborated by the [diminishing relative core count](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large/public/inline-images/cuda_percent_7_full-4x_foolhardy_Remacri.png.webp) to the flagship we see in these newer generations. The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  If we look at the 30 series (the last generation to provide generational improvements across the board, and not just for select cards), we see how bad it currently is.  The 5080 offers 50% of the 5090's core count for 50% of the price. Seems reasonable, but it becomes a shit value proposition when you consider that the 3070 offered **56%** of the 3090's core count for only **33%** of the price. For a more direct relative price comparison, the 3080 offered **83%** of the 3090's cores for **53%** of the price.  The 5070 offers 28% of the 5090's cores for 27.5% of the price. Again, seems reasonable until you consider the price to relative core ratio of the 3070 I just mentioned. To rub salt into the wound, spending **26.6%** of the 3090's MSRP would have gotten you a 3060 Ti with **46.3%** of the cores.  By relative core count, the 5080 should be a 70 class. And this translates over to performance, too. The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090, while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was. What used to be the 80 class is extinct, there's no denying it.  I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here. Unless you literally work for their PR department and are paid to do this, you gain absolutely nothing trying to justify and rationalize the diminishing returns and increasing shrinkflation we've been seeing from the consumer cards.

AMD,">I never claimed that at all, don't put words in my mouth.  That is why there is an IF. How am I supposed to know that you don't think a 70 class card trading blows with the prior 90 model is not good? Why even write that as a seemingly positive example then? That is just misleading.  >The 5080 is the only 80 class card to not beat or even match the previous generation's 90/Titan class. Fact.  Which means little because Nvidia is the one setting the comparison for flagship. They can release a 90 series card that is just a refresh and there is nothing you can do about it cause they are a quasi-monopoly in the high-end. Thus, flagship performance is a really bad baseline to work with. What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites - and this baseline IS actually relevant for gaming.  >The 50 series has some of the worst stagnation we've ever seen from a new generation.

The current 5080 has a relative core count that is comparable to what the 70 class cards of the past offered.  Which is even less relevant. It does not matter. Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance. Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  >I really don't understand why you're going to bat so hard for Nvidia here.

You are the one trying to state that Nvidia used to be much better - And I am telling you: No, they weren't. That is just nostalgia glasses and a confound of the overall economic situation.

AMD,"Sorry, I won't be giving praise to a game that proudly uses AI",Negative
AMD,">Why even write that as a seemingly positive example then? That is just misleading.  Because we're discussing the stagnation of the 50 series here, buddy.  >They can release a 90 series card that is just a refresh  And this is nothing more than a meaningless hypothetical. The 90 class cards are the only ones that have been consistently getting the generation to generation performance improvements, and the fact is that the rest of the lineup hasn't followed suit. Sure, if the 6090 has a performance uplift as marginal as the one from the 3090 to the 3090 Ti then your argument may have a leg to stand on. But that has not happened. Well, it did for the 5070, but that's another topic.  The 80 class used to provide similar die sizes and core counts as the 90/Titan class. It no longer does. No matter what mental gymnastics you'd like to do to justify this, you cannot deny this.  >What you should set as a baseline, is the main consumer cards, i.e. 60 and 70 models (maybe add 80 for the high-end consumer), that set the baseline for hardware prerequisites  And given the shrinking relative core counts and die sizes, it's clear that Nvidia can set these mid range tiers just as arbitrarily as they set ""the comparison for flagship"" as you say. You bring up the hypothetical that they can release a next gen 90 series card that is just a refresh. I bring up the reality that they *actually did that* for the 5070. Tell me then, why would the ""main consumer cards"" serve as a better baseline when the exact thing you claimed might happen to the 90 series actually happened to the 70 series?  If anything, your ""5070 -> 5080 = 50%"" is even more invalid than making comparisons to the flagship class, because the 70 class is a stagnant product and what your comparison is really saying is that the 5080 is only 50% faster than a 70 class card from the last generation.  >Which also means nothing because we are talking about the prices for the consumer. Whether the market stagnates or not is IRRELEVANT to the level of pricing.  It does mean something, because you are completely ignoring the aspect of value here. The 5070 being $50 less than the 4070 Super is not a particularly big win when I could have bought the 4070 Super at launch and got an entire year of usage out of it before the 5070 even came out and provided no performance uplift.  Hell, by your logic, they could have released the 5070 at $600 (making it a literal rebadge of the 4070 Super) and you would have been fine with that, and fine with comparing it to a 5080 because ""stagnation is irrelevant to pricing"". Never mind the shitty value proposition that would be.  You used to be able to spend less than a grand (even adjusted for inflation) on a 3080 and get something that was pretty much just as good as the best GPU in the world at the time. *That's* a meaningful metric for value, not comparing a 5080 to a lower tier graphics card that isn't even better than its predecessor.  >Practically NOONE buys GPUs for relative core count - consumers buy it for performance.  Well, good thing I brought up performance in my comment then! Did you have trouble seeing it? I can make it bigger so you don't miss it this time.  # The 5080 is only 66% as fast as the 5090 (at 50% the price), while the 3070 was 70% as fast as the 3090 was (at 33% the price).  That's a pretty good argument for the shitty value of the current 80 class, no?  >Whether Nvidia saves more money by using smaller chips or not - as long as you get the performance you need for a certain price, that is a non-argument.  This only matters if we can get better performance out of shrinking dies. The 4070 Super had a much smaller die than the 3090 and matched it in performance. In that case, sure, they got the same performance out of less silicon, and could justify the diminishing relative core count.  But saying it's a non argument no matter what as long as ""you get the performance you need"" is an awful argument. That is just settling for mediocrity and stagnation. By your logic, the 6070, and 7070, and 8070 could come out, be exactly the same as the 5070 for the same price, and it'd be a perfectly fine product because ""you get the performance you need"".  >that Nvidia used to be much better - And I am telling you: No, they weren't.  And how do you justify this? The hard fact is that you used to be able to buy a 70 class card that would match the flagship card of the previous generation. Or an 80 class card that would soundly beat it. Each new generation (save for a couple exceptions) offered incredible value in that sense. This one does not. You literally cannot ignore the diminishing generational improvements we have been seeing.  I'm not saying Nvidia was some great company before, but when we literally do not see the generational improvements they used to provide, how can you sit here and claim that ""they weren't better"" before?

AMD,I’m in the same boat as you got 2 6900xts and 2 6800s and I feel the run just about anything I want maybe this will finally make developers optimize there games better when people can’t run there shitty game because they can’t get a new Gpu to run it.,Neutral

AMD,So please stop thinking about pc forever and find a new hobby.  You would do us all a favor,Neutral
AMD,I picked up my 9070xt a couple months ago and just got a 9060xt for my tv gaming box.   Half temped to pick up a B580 as a cheap standby card if this all gets stupid expensive and something breaks.,Negative
AMD,Lmao I hope it sets me up that long!,Positive
AMD,10 years?!?!? Two gens..three gens if you push it,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I'm going to function like a normal human being, look at the price of something, decide its not worth the amount of money and I'm happy enough with what I've got.  And, like most humans do, complain about how expensive everything is lmao.",Negative
AMD,Yea tough times,Neutral
AMD,"It's about standards and expectations, and also the games you play. People have this weird fetish over pre-set graphics settings like 'Ultra' when by being more selective it's possible to get perfectly adequate gaming experiences at lower settings. Not to mention the vast difference in playing in 1080p @60hz versus 4k at 165...",Negative
AMD,I dont mean 1440p ultra for 10 years lol,Neutral
AMD,If you're happy with it that's different. Out of curiosity what do you play?,Neutral
AMD,But then you get reddit crying over optimization...10 years is horseshit always has been always will be  By this logic the thing should last forever...but when you're running games at 35 fps on low..the card is done and has been for a couple years,Negative
AMD,"Dude, go away. Mind your own business.",Neutral
AMD,"The trend is for gpus to last longer now than they did ten years ago. We are reaching the point where we don't need higher res and we don't need more frames. A 1080ti is what, 8 years old at least? They are literally releasing xx50's and xx60's today that barely outperform it in pure performance...  And we should _all_ cry about optimisation, _regardles_ of the performance of our cards.",Negative
AMD,"Lmao you guys are weird as hell. They complain, I say why, they say they're happy. I say what games you play, now some random tells me go away.   A 1650 can't even play unreal engine 4 games at good enough quality, obviously I'm interested in what games that piece of shit card can even manage aside from Minecraft.",Negative
AMD,"So you are trying to make your perceived ""trend"" of GPUs last 10 years by means of crying..lol have fun with that..  If you honestly think any of these cards are going to last 10 years with shifting A.I. tech then you're high...they may last less time if anything",Negative
AMD,I've played ex33 fine on my pc.  Played a ton of bg3 and it ran just fine.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah this is such a weird thing to think. That's basically saying you want a 980ti to still be good these days. Complete bonkers but I guess according to reddit it's fine since all new games are trash, fun is forbidden und you have to be a patient gamer waiting 10 years to play anything",Negative
AMD,Who is crying?  Are you an adult or is there no point engaging in this further.  Please tell me how 'shifting AI' tech is going to stop my 3080 or someone else's 5080 from being able to play games.,Negative

AMD,"Thanks for the tip. I'm very wary of buying CPUs used, too much uncertainty around such a sensitive part.",Positive
AMD,"You're not entirely wrong, but at the same time it is exceedingly rare for a CPU to fail. If there are bent pins, you get a refund and move on. Odds are it works totally fine, assuming the seller is reputable and not from China lol. There is some fake stuff out there. For $25 though, who cares lol.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, who knows if they can just pivot their chips to be packed into Epycs instead of Ryzens. It's the same curse/blessing when you have chiplet design, you could just scale it up for AI bros if you really wanted to.",Neutral
AMD,now what I will do with all those ryzen cpus I panic bought this week,Neutral
AMD,But RAM on the other hand…,Neutral
AMD,"Do you have the rest of the specs? Like the motherboard, or the specific type of SSD? Just to make sure they aren’t cheaping out on an important component to save money.  In a vacuum though, this doesn’t seem too bad. Really good CPU and GPU, and everything else seems good for that class of PC. If you don’t understand enough about PCs to build one, and would prefer a prebuilt, I think this is a solid one.",Neutral
AMD,"In this market? I'd take it. It's about a $200+/- difference building it yourself. The difference in price boils down to what the components actually are (Brand, CL rating, PSU rating, SSD gen, etc.)",Neutral
AMD,No motherboard? Hah. I’m sure there is as long as some low end for that hardware. It’s not bad price. If you pick those parts yourself does it add up to that price?,Neutral
AMD,This is a really solid price in the current market with ram and storage prices. Unlikely you beat it building yourself.  edit: [This is about as cheap as I could get it without real compromise.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/rfMKyW),Positive

AMD,"Follow up question, if you don't mind.  Given the choice between 2 bundles at the same price which would you pick?  9800x3D/B650E  or  7800x3D/X870E  Both ASUS MoBo. I'm just now finding out about Micro Center and there's one in my city.",Neutral
AMD,"I didn't realize I cut out the MoBo.  It's a Gigabyte B850 and and if I pick those parts myself to pre-build, it comes out about $200-300 more than this.",Neutral
AMD,"[This](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NjXNfd) is actually the build I put together myself, opting for the 4TB, since I do video and audio editing. (My drum software is massive) and going for the OC GPU for gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"Interesting. It's an easy question with a not so easy logic. Here's how I see it:  7800X3D/X870E: - A future proof board. - PCIE 5.0 support. - Up to 5 M.2 NVME SSD, two of which support Gen 5. - Tons of ports with USB 4.0. - Supports up to 4 SATAs at 6/gbs. - Up to 256gb of RAM. - Plenty Fan, AIO, and RGB connectors. - 7800X3D performance is not too far behind a 9800X3D, so it won't be a bottleneck anytime soon. Best performance/$ value.  9800X3D/B650E-E (TUF?): - A solid board. - PCIE 4.0 support. - Up to 3 M.2 NVME SSD, with primary supporting Gen 5. - Less ports with USB 3.0. - Supports up to 2 SATAs. - Up to 192gb of RAM. - Fans, AIO, and RGB connectors. - 9800X3D is the best CPU for gaming and some productivity at the moment. Will probably outlive some components.  These are all the important things (at least to me) that I remember from when I was doing some research for my current build. I ultimately went with a 9800X3D because of its performance and projected longevity, and a X870E because of how much features and future proofing it offers. But what really sold me on these is what I plan to do in the future. I'm currently running a digital storage and plex server with my older PC. In the future, my current build will be my next server, so having the option to expand the storage, memory, and connect more peripherals was a very attractive prospect.  Like I said, not an easy logic. To summarize it for you; buy the one that you think will satisfy your need and your expectations. But whichever one you choose, it's not a bad one.",Positive
AMD,Right so this is a good deal regardless. Especially with prices of ram and soon to be ssd right now.,Positive
AMD,"Congrats bro, mine is coming in on the 6th",Neutral
AMD,Nice man Congrats.,Positive
AMD,"That's very interesting.  Certainly 10 or even 15% can't be worth 100$?  But what about the 9070 (non-XT)? would +-5% and 16gb of varm be worth it for 0$ extra?  10gb of vram in use is a worrying when thinking about the future for the little 12gb vram buffer.  But then again, what if we introduce older generations and the used market?  What about something like a 4070 (super and TI)?  if 15% more performance isn't worth 100$.   is it then worth saving another 100$ for 10-15% less than the 5070?",Neutral
AMD,Which one would you choose to game daily?,Neutral
AMD,What settings are you using for the path tracing run?  I set the ultra Rt settings then changed dlss to balanced and turned on path tracing and ran it and got about 90 fps on my oced 5070 ti [https://imgur.com/a/x2LjKDs](https://imgur.com/a/x2LjKDs)   that would put it at 55 percent faster than the 5070 and 65 percent faster than the 9070 xt which seems like too big of a gap and I did the run with quite a few background tasks going on.,Neutral
AMD,"I would try overclocking before you choose too, both cards OC pretty well although I've been able to run my 5070 at 3268mhz@ 1.06v with memory at +2150mhz and +10% power limit, it gets a good increase in FPS without using much more power and temps never saw them over 65c with memory at 75c.",Positive
AMD,"That's a great question. I still have some weeks to decide which one to return. Over the last days i've been gaming on the 5070 because it arrived earlier than expected. Now that the XT is here, I'm running it to see if i like it enough to pay $100 more.",Positive
AMD,"I would opt for the XT, not because I like AMD more, but because those extra 4GB of VRAM will absolutely serve you more time in the future.",Neutral
AMD,"You did really well honestly, you'd be hard pressed to build this yourself for under 2000 these days, and you get the keyboard and mouse for free",Positive
AMD,That’s really not bad at all.,Negative
AMD,"It's a decent purchase without knowing all the tech specs like Mobo revision, psu, ram speed ect.  - good GPU - good CPU - decent ram - reasonable storage",Positive
AMD,"Thanks, friend! Random question- how do I add my PC specs under my user name? lol",Positive
AMD,"The si prices will go up once they run out of stock and have to order more, probably mid 2026 would be my guess",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the feedback! RAM is 5200 ghz, Mobo is MSI B650 pro, PSU is 750w but PC has water cooling. I’ve been playing different games at max settings 1440p, temps haven’t gone higher than 55-60C.",Positive
AMD,Go to the pcmr sub reddit click on 3 dots top right corner and than edit flair,Neutral
AMD,"Nice!  My current monitor is a  2k uhd 3840 × 2160 @240hz which I game on and my old 1440 32"" I use for my workstation. Since I've been 1440 I can go back to 1080 as it looks rough to me and I can't deal with monitors smaller than 32""... I'm getting old 😂",Positive
AMD,"Thx, man",Negative
AMD,"LOL I hear ya! Any recommendations for a 1440p monitor that would pair well with this build? My current one is an LG 27” 165hz 1440p and I think it’s an IPS. Graphics look amazing, not sure if it’s possible for things to look even better haha…this is the model LG 27gp83b b",Positive
AMD,"I like the Samsung G7 Odyssey 32"" 4k @144hz. I know it's samsung but I've never had a bad panel and never had any issues. I think my G5 is about 3-5 years old.  Because you have AMD and this monitor has Freesync it means you don't have to worry about v-snyc ever again. I have a G5 32"" on my workstation 2560 x 1440 and some have dogged them but for me it's been a workhorse with it now on my workstation.",Positive
AMD,"I’m trying to stay 1440p, this one can probably run games at 4K but don’t want to push it. I’m good with 1440p max settings, the G7 might not work if it’s 4K. Thoughts?",Neutral
AMD,"It would work well. You can still run games @1440 and you'd benefit from the higher ppi (pixels per inch) of the higher resolution panel and then games which aren't AAA or older titles you could run at 4K.   I play a mix of games from AAA to pure indie titles. Currently I'm going through Cyberpunk and it's beautiful! Before that I was playing Megabonk, Tower of Bable, Elden Ring, Schedule 1, X⁴ Foundations and Deep Rock Survivor.   Yeah I mainly play single player games and not too many FPS games either. I can't remember the last FPS I played, probably Arma3 or Trepang²  Of course this is wholly my opinion on the matter so you do you.",Positive
AMD,So that monitor can display both resolutions?,Neutral
AMD,Yep! If you're playing a game and it struggles at 4k. Lower the resolution in the game settings or keep the resolution and lower the graphics.  I'm currently playing cyberpunk @4k with mods and it looks amazing.,Positive
AMD,"Perfect! Thanks! Just to confirm, the G7 not the G5 right?",Positive
AMD,"This post has been flaired as a rumor.   Rumors may end up being true, completely false or somewhere in the middle.  Please take all rumors and any information not from AMD or their partners with a grain of salt and degree of skepticism.",Negative
AMD,"Nothing much to be excited about, since Gorgon Point is just a Strix Point refresh.  You get slightly higher clocks but otherwise it's mostly the same.",Neutral
AMD,"If these rumors are true, I am wondering why they haven't moved onto RNDA 4 based iGPs instead of the RDNA 3.5 they've been using for a while. Makes me wonder if they are just waiting for RDNA5/UDNA before updating their iGPs.",Neutral
AMD,"Damn, AMD core stagnation is REAL  Quad core Ryzen 5 in 2026 is insane",Negative
AMD,Gorgon is a refresh of Strix. Not new silicon. It’s still RDNA3.5 for that reason alone.,Neutral
AMD,"[3.5 was specifically made for mobile](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amds-tweaked-rdna-35-gpu-is-solely-focused-on-improving-mobile-gaming-performance/) and 4 as per leaks and rumors, didn’t have any plan to release on the mobile space (either scrapped alongside top dies or never was, don’t know which to believe)  A “good enough” strategy until they deem the next arch to be viable and feasible for mobile requirements.  Also, 3.5 is still new and these upcoming are refreshes.",Neutral
AMD,I think your guess is right. I suspect they will update their entire line with UDNA when it releases,Neutral
AMD,"Remember, the main limit for an igpu is the memory bandwidth and latency since it uses ram. Strix halo has a wider bus thus higher bandwidth, but all the others use normal lpddr5x, for example in handhelds. It might be that a rdna4 igpu isn't really faster than a 3.5 one due to this aspect alone, even if it would have nice features like fsr4. They probably are waiting for ddr6 memory to increase the bandwidth and put stronger igpus in devices, or at least this is my theory.",Neutral
AMD,This is just a refresh of the current lineup. It is heavily rumoured that Zen6 will feature more cores.,Neutral
AMD,"RDNA4 introduced new compression tech, which is why it gets away with rather small bandwidth, though perhaps 3.5 already has that",Neutral
AMD,LPDDR5X 10667 is in mass production and matches the introductory data rate of LPDDR6 (if we ignore 1.5X channel/ECC overhead). They can brute force GB/s issue.   Also RDNA 3.5 has many of RAM BW saving tech as so we'll see how much they actually need to push this. See C&C breakdown and LLVM post u/Defeqel.  But it's an easy win for higher end configs for sure as they're prob BW starved rn.  AMD better have FSR4 INT8 ready by 2026 because RDNA 3.5 products are going nowhere. Even standard SoCs with Medusa Point (without dGPU die) will reuse RDNA 3.5 for another gen according to Kepler\_L2. No UDNA except for premium mobile SKUs (with seperate dGPU die bolted on) it seems u/SAUCEYOLOSWAG and u/Hero_The_Zero   But it's good enough for entry level as it doesn't need ML power of RDNA 4 or GFX13 and like u/J05A3 said it's new and it'll prob be a repeat of Vega 7nm iGPU except this time even more prolonged.,Neutral
AMD,Hopefully   AMD has been on 6/8 core Ryzen 5/7 longer than Intel was on 4 cores lol,Positive
AMD,"did you forget that the x950 parts launched in 2019? sure the cheaper mainstream is still 8 cores, but Intel was selling 8 cores for $1000 until Zen. at least AMD isn't selling 16 cores for that still though I hope they increase mainstream to 32 soon.",Neutral
AMD,I did not. But did you forget that those were a different price class and basically HEDT and not really mainstream?  AMD has had the same core counts on their mainstream CPUs for almost 9 years LOL.,Neutral
AMD,"they're on the mainstream platform without HEDT features. though it's proving that without competition from Intel, AMD will do the same thing as them. it's actually even longer if you consider Bulldozer an 8-core lol",Neutral
AMD,"This post has been flaired as a rumor.   Rumors may end up being true, completely false or somewhere in the middle.  Please take all rumors and any information not from AMD or their partners with a grain of salt and degree of skepticism.",Negative
AMD,"The biggest factor of whether this will be loved or ignored *(regardless of price)* is we know that it's going to be higher binned chip, but for overclockers, if the memory controller on it is improved and people can push RAM overclocking into the 8600Mhz to 9000Mhz, then it will sell out amongst enthusiasts instantly.  I expect Zen 6 to be able to do 9000Mhz+ but if they can squeeze out some extra juice with the 9850x3d on current generation, then it'll get the enthusiast community excited until Zen 6 drops.",Positive
AMD,"PassMark, my favorite game.",Positive
AMD,4.7% more for a lot more heat and power.,Neutral
AMD,Seems to be basically the same multi score you get with +200mhz maybe slightly higher single core because of 5.6ghz. If it costs more it will be meh. If it’s the same price then it will become a why not kinda upgrade over the 9800x3d but will likely also make the 9800x3d a better deal till its stock runs out at least,Neutral
AMD,"Waiting for Zen 6 and the 12 core CCD, gonna upgrade to that once it launches... 7700X can soldier on till then.",Neutral
AMD,Memory has become so unattainable that it sort of moots any interest in upgrading from AM4,Neutral
AMD,Sounds kinda pointless,Neutral
AMD,I'm so whelmed,Neutral
AMD,"I'll wait till am6, my 5800x3d and 7900xtx is fine. Especially with ram prices the way they are. The ram in my cart that I had since last year was less than $200 now its $700.",Neutral
AMD,"So like a normal 9800X3D, just mildly OC'd? Only real difference might be a better memory controller that could maybe handle 4 DIMMs of RAM easier/faster RAM, but seeing current RAM prices AMD might not even bother because who has the money for that sorta setup ATM?",Neutral
AMD,Just wait for Zen 6 x3d...,Neutral
AMD,So it's a 9800x3d with pbo on. Cool,Positive
AMD,But will it be 4.7% more expensive? /s,Negative
AMD,I’m waiting for 10800X3D,Neutral
AMD,"I genuinely wonder why they're releasing this chip now. Normally they do these type of things with GPUs on a refresh cycle, as they phase them out and have extras on the mature node. But here it just seems, unnecessary? Theres definitely a market for these top chips, but with the current RAM prices its harder to justify a premium OC product for a majority of consumers.",Negative
AMD,Make sense if its one ccd from 9950x3d.(and single core score is slightly lower)   So reduction from 5.7 to 5.6Ghz with reduced cache. Ofc i could be wrong but it would make sense to me.,Neutral
AMD,How would it compare to 9950 x3d tho,Neutral
AMD,This is only gonna make the jump to Zen 6 looks less impressive I feel lol.,Negative
AMD,Damn I just got a 9800x3d too. Still haven’t build it yet tho its in its box. Im not sure if its worth returning and getting a 9850x3d for a 4.7% difference tho what do you think?,Negative
AMD,Thinking about upgrading my 5800X3D for one of these but I can't afford ram.  Going to be waiting another gen probably.,Neutral
AMD,Meh,Neutral
AMD,Could have called it 9847X3D for clarity,Neutral
AMD,Dumb product. Why releasing something only negilblbe  increase,Neutral
AMD,Cool,Positive
AMD,"I have a feeling the IMC will stay the same, if AMD had to bin both the memory controller and the CPU cores so 6600 1:1 and/or 8600 1:2 would be possible and stable with the CPU running at 5.6+ GHz then they would only have a handful of 9850X3D processors to sell at a high price.  Imagine selling your 9800X3D (a good sample capable of doing 6400 1:1 CL28 with tight timings) and ending up with a 9850X3D stuck at 6000 MT/s in a 1:1 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen 6 will be a huge generational improvement due to the elimination of the Infinity Fabric bottleneck and having ""sea of wires"" instead. We'll see large bandwidth and latency improvements.",Neutral
AMD,ELI5 : Is there even going to be a benefit for the average Joe looking to run 1440p@144 to 165fps with monster-frequency RAM kits? Or is this purely a min-maxxing thing for people running 360Hz+ looking for incredible 1% lows and highest fps they can get at 1080p and whatnot?,Neutral
AMD,"The memory controller will be exactly the same because the memory controller is in the iodie and they are not changing the iodie   On an 8 core amd cpu, 6000mt/s is already hitting the bandwidth limit on the fabric speed   For 8000mts ram to matter at all, you need multiple chiplets for ccd",Neutral
AMD,I just wish for better memory controller that can easily support 4 sticks of ram instead of 2. It's been too many years of wait.,Negative
AMD,"Will people go for it? By the time this is released the high performance RAM may cost the same, if not more, than the CPU",Neutral
AMD,Lmao. No. They did not design a better IMC for this cash grab gamer brain chip.,Negative
AMD,And 4% !! Gosh imagine the seconds saved in a month,Neutral
AMD,The single core score is what I learned when I started onto console emulation on PC.,Neutral
AMD,And likely not very noticeable to anyone using a GPU worse than a 4090/5090,Negative
AMD,They seem to list it as the same power as the 9800X3D. I suspect this is just a better bin of zen5 chiplet,Neutral
AMD,"Not necessarily, they will be just better binned chips meaning higher clocks at lower voltage. Depending on how crazy these are binned you could technically have chips that pull similar power at 5.6ghz as a bad 9800x3d at 5.2.  I'm guessing most of them will just be a minor power increase over your typical 9800x3d.",Neutral

AMD,Wait I was supposed to get 6400 not 6000? Fml.,Neutral
AMD,"We're gonna get owned by RAM prices, though.",Neutral
AMD,"For the average Joe case you mentioned, barely any difference. The main gains would be waiting for Zen 6 *(next-gen CPU's on AM5 that should come by mid-to-end next year),* I would not waste a single $ on these if someone already has a 7800X3D or a 9800X3D.",Neutral

AMD,"TDP is ""thermal design power"" which refers to how much heat energy the cooling solution is expected to need to be able to exhaust in order for the device to run at manufactured spec.  The blanketed design of the x3d layer in the 7800x3d and earlier generations traps heat more strongly than in the 9800x3d where the x3d layer is on the bottom.   This trapping effect means that the older x3d cpus  cannot have too much power usage lest they burn, and that they need a stronger cooler than would typically be required for the amount of power they actually use lest they end up too hot and thermal throttle heavily.  I'm not saying the 9850x3d and 9800x3d are likely to use the same default power limits, but I am saying that their TDP are probably much more comparable than is the case as between the 9800x3d and 7800x3d.",Neutral

AMD,"it's not just ""how much heat energy"" but the area it's being emitted from too. Also, it's not a standard formula that every manufacturer uses, one heatsink company uses a different formula to define their TDP compared to a different heatsink company, so they aren't even directly comparable.  For example, a 5 millimeter square piece of silicon using 120w needs a higher TDP cooler than a 10 millimeter square one also using 120w. Coupled with the TDP ""bins"" AMD wants to put their CPUs in (either 65w, 105w, 120w, nothing inbetween right now) you get these wide spread where you have two 120w TDP CPUs and one uses literally twice the power as the other and even goes above the TDP rating stock (9800x3d uses 140w, tdp is 120w), tdp is just about the general class of cooler you need and not much else",Neutral

AMD,"I'm pretty sure no. As 9800x3D owner who was previously on 5950x, I won't notice slightly more single core perf. What would be a noticeably a boost would be having a rumored monolythic Zen6 12-core CPU. A bit more IPC and 50% more cores for few other use cases while no drawbacks of talking inter CCD.",Neutral
AMD,"It depends on what you consider ""worth it"".  You can sell 9800x3d and add a little to get 9850x3d if you really care about slightly more performance, maybe better OC to you're memory if you got a bad chip currently and a better resell quality later because this chip is simple newer.

AMD,Mine can't go past -15 lol,Neutral
AMD,"That's not exactly how it works though. The undervolt offset is relative to starting point, he could have more headroom for the exact opposite reason from a performance/watt perspective (chip running higher vcore values from the factory)  Undervolt values don't mean anything without the actual voltages, frequency, stability, and other contributing variables if we're keeping it real.  It can also mean what you suggest, but without more info it's impossible to conclude either way. -30mV means nothing in its own, a better chip out of the box running at -20mV could very well be outperforming it without having more info.",Neutral

AMD,"True but Zen 5 isn't a good enough generational upgrade yet, clocking it higher for another 5% that will result in higher power consumption in gaming loads isn't what I want either.  Really this refresh is a big load of nothing? Other than for show offs and tech channels that can swap in a slightly faster gaming CPU for GPU testing as well as a review content vid to tide over until Zen 6 which AMD has slated for 2026... same year this binned CPU is releasing. Doubt it'll have the value proposition in Zen 6's life to make sense either as the non X3D parts are always a lot cheaper and fill the price to performance role as is, and Zen 6 in leaks looks like a good one for uplifts cache or not unlike 5 that had a more bottlenecked design that benefited the cache parts more uplift wise.   I'm sure it'll sell though, it's why AMD is doing it, Zen 5 X3D is their golden milking machine that sells for MSRP even now, obviously business wise makes sense to release the golden bins that can clock higher for an extra 5% performance at a premium for those who want the best of the best NOW. AMD leads in performance, those chasing the best will take it if they don't want to hold for Zen 6.",Negative

AMD,I wouldn’t be surprised if they are reasoning prices on CPUs to help hedge against rising ram cost.,Neutral
AMD,"There's legitimate no reason for a price hike.  There's a price hike in DRAM because nvidia is buying out all the allocation for their next gen AI GPUs. But 9000 series is built on *N4P whereas next gen AI GPUs will likely be built on N3P (Ruben) and N2P (Rubin Ultra, i.e. the ""SUPER"" refresh of AI GPUs). So there's no effect on AMD allocation as Nvidia have no need to buy out that node.*  AMD also likely have their allocation for N3P or N2P set for their next gen CPUs so unlikely to be hurt here either.  However, if rumours are true, all allocation for A16 has already been bought out by Nvidia, so there will be some competition down the line for sub N2P allocation between Apple, AMD and all of TSMC other high end customers.

AMD,"As someone on a 7600X...hold for Zen 6, pretty sure a slide AMD did last month put Zen 6 as 2026. This higher binned Zen 5 X3D is coming early 2026, it's just milking the last of what they can of Zen 5 X3D with a more expensive sku they can charge a premium for before Zen 6 tanks the value of such a part.   Like the clock speed boost is only 400mhz, that's maybe 7% higher boost (that will mean higher power draw), probably about 5-6% faster gaming performance if that. It isn't really going to change Zen 5 from being a skip to worth it if the 9800X3D wasn't enough for you already.

AMD,"This deal is frustratingly good. This would be the best time to get one, but I know that Zen 6 is going to be such a substantial upgrade that this will feel like a huge waste of money. I don't expect Zen 7 to be nearly as much of one (though all those leaks sound crazy), and it will *probably* be AM6 anyway (I don't believe the ""still on AM5"" leaks at all), but we'll just have to see.",Negative
AMD,I love that was able to convince Best Buy rep to price match Microcenters $399 price for my 9800X3D back during Primes October Prime Big Sale and able to complete my build before Halloween while my 32gig of Corsair RGB Vengeance was still at $150,Positive
AMD,def worth getting,Negative
AMD,"Incredible deal! Too bad you need to sell a kidney to get any DDR5, though",Negative

AMD,Riding this 5800X3D until there’s actually a game I’m not satisfied with performance-wise. I keep getting tempted but then remember there’s currently nothing my computer doesn’t do perfectly well for me.,Negative
AMD,"I… gave in, late last week, since I have a need for a more portable system here at home. “Only” a 7800X3D bc the Newegg deal that bundled a AIO with it fit with the case I wanted.. the AIO with the 9800X3D’s bundle was too big. Also got a good deal on RAM, as it was bundled with a 4TB PCIe 5 SSD, and I was wanting more storage anyway. But originally I had been planning on holding off until Zen 6 (or possibly Intel Nova Lake). I guess I still will in the sense that I intend to swap in a top-end Zen 6 X3D CPU, when it’s out.",Neutral
AMD,"I sold my 13700k for a 9800X3D, super worth it. That being said, I am also an idiot.",Negative
AMD,"next gen will be on the same socket so upgrading sooner than later is better assuming you end up getting one more gen out of the socket. but if you wait until next gen it's likely to be the last gen on the am5 socket so you won't really be able to upgrade, unless you did like a 11500f then later upgraded to a 11850x3d",Neutral

AMD,Ordered mine just in time before it disappeared for good and I'm so glad I did. I do feel the itch to upgrade but certainly not until RAM prices normalize  surely they will normalize,Positive
AMD,I’m seriously thinking about upgrading to an AM4 X3D from 5600 because it doesn’t look like I’ll be going to DDR5 and AM5 anytime soon judging by the prices.,Negative
AMD,No it wouldn't be worth it if you have the 7800x3D. It's like 0-10% performance boost depending on the game if you have a 4090 or better.,Negative
AMD,"Yes, this would be overkill. Keep your 7800X3D, it's still going to be a good chip for a while. Wait and see what the ""11800X3D"" will be like.",Positive
AMD,"Also consider the fact that it will be another year (most likely) before the next gen, with no confirmation if 3D will be available at launch. And even if it has the same MSRP it would need to be what 40% better in gaming to exceed price/performance.   Getting a year of smooth gameplay at what will likely be equal p/p seems like a good deal to me.",Neutral

AMD,I’m not subbed.,Neutral
AMD,Would you say you remain on the edge of glory?,Neutral
AMD,why not buy the first X3D on AM6?,Neutral
AMD,Feels like that'll be the wisest move from now on; buy platforms when they've released they're last gen memory wise. Basically Zen 7 on AM5 and something on LGA 1954 (Hammer Lake?). DDR6 is going to be expensive and hopefully by then DDR5 will drop to low price for 8800+ MT/s Kits.,Neutral
AMD,"Same, but I think I will wait for at least second gen AM6 so I dont beta test the new socket",Neutral
AMD,See you in 2028,Neutral
AMD,"This was my setup before my roommate wanted to upgrade his cpu a while back, so I justified it then. It's fantastic and a noticeable upgrade, but my ram that I got for it now is $350 compared to $110 so it's definitely not worth rn.",Negative
AMD,"I could, but the rumors around Zen 6, make it *very* appealing, such as: 7+GHz clock speeds (over the 7800X3D’s 5), 12-core CCDs, an improved memory controller/IOdie, more IPC, 2 (4?) LP cores, a NPU, and.. possibly other things. More L1, L2 cache as well. If those are all true, a 50% or so performance boost, worth the upgrade I think.  Zen 7 is enticing too, but at least 2 years out from Zen 6. While the rumors have it on AM5, we also don’t know how the RAM crisis will change things. If, god forbid, RAM remains hideously expensive for years, then is there really a downside to going to DDR6, for the performance it brings? I could even see it being *cheaper* than DDR5 at launch bc of where the LLM demand is. But idk, that’s all just speculation, and hopefully the AI bubble will break soon and it’ll be a non-issue. Zen 7 on AM5 would be nice, yeah",Positive
AMD,Plot twist if the 13700k multithreading throughput magically/finally ends up mattering,Neutral

AMD,$350? Must only be getting a single 8gb stick....,Neutral
AMD,"350? That's still cheap by today's standard. I paid like 280 or something for 96GB for my 13th Gen Intel build. 16GB kits are aroubd that price now.   ""Nah dawg. $350,000"" lol",Negative
AMD,Yeah that seems to be another problem,Negative
AMD,Then why comment if you’re not interested?,Negative
AMD,"Because X3D of previous gen gets some discount when a new platform gets released, like 5800X3D was for a couple of months when AM5 got released (then price shot to the moon because last gen top chip of AM4 platform). So like the theoretical 11800X3D (if that gen is still AM5) or maybe a lower binned 11700X3D is gonna be cheaper when AM6 gets released.",Neutral
AMD,Likely waiting until 2030+ for that and paying a \*huge\* premium. 2029/2030 for Zen 7 X3D> 2035-2037 for Zen 10/Zen 11 X3D (whichever is the final AM6 gen) seems much more wiser.,Neutral
AMD,This is the way,Neutral
AMD,Yes AM5 7800x3D or 9800x3d would a good upgrade but i guess I'll wait till another gen. Currently my rig just sits at home most of the year because of work travel.   My current main setup is a LP7 7945HX 4080mobile. I have modded my laptop a bit which allowing me OC my CPU and ram which is running at 6000 CL36-37-37-34. Currently I am trying to tune a 6200 profile.   The FPS I get in both setups is pretty similar. I guess its because of the 5800x3D and slower ddr4.,Neutral

AMD,Felt like it.,Neutral
AMD,And DDR6 won't be cheap at all.,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but then you will have to rebuy literally everything, from motherboard to ram, instead of buying the first AM6 X3D and maybe last X3D when AM7 will be out or close to it",Neutral
AMD,I’m planning the same except getting 11950x3d. If I’m going to be riding it for years might as well go with the best of the best chip.,Neutral
AMD,Yup bought mine right at that moment (also because DDR5 was too expensive) and I‘m still very much bottlenecked by my GPU…,Negative
AMD,"exactly, first and last AM6 now that we re on last AM4.",Neutral
AMD,"MLiD usually predicts things further out, so he tends to be more inaccurate compared to many leakers, this isn't a surprise to me. Naturally, when you are talking about products a couple years out, lots of things aren't ""nailed down"" by the companies themselves, and therefore are subject to change. I'll also say something that applies to all leakers/rumormongers and not MLiD specifically: people like to slam them when they're wrong, but rarely give kudos when they're right. Either wrong or right, I do find the rumors to be entertaining though!  Zen 6 is jumping several nodes. Obviously we'll have to wait for released CPUs and independent testing to have an informed opinion as to how good they are, but with AMD jumping several nodes next-gen, the rumors at least strike me as plausible.. you may feel differently.",Neutral
AMD,"Exactly. Though those products have had problematic names for years now. So I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if they did it with desktop too. AMD does make stupid decisions, sometimes.",Negative
AMD,Gigachad,Neutral
AMD,"Except I don't because why should I upgrade within the platform? That's never necessary. I can just go to the next platform in like 8-10 years after the build, which is right around the timeframe from Ryzen 5000 and Ryzen 11000 too.",Neutral
AMD,">Zen 6 is jumping several nodes  This is also speculation  Rumors are rumors, and they're at least half of AMD's source of disappointment, the other half being their own marketing team.  It's fine to see rumors and ""leaks"" as entertainment, but to refer to them as a reason to buy X or hold off till Y or whatever is nonsense.  The reason we shouldn't credit MLiD when he's right, is because he usually keeps spewing BS until we're down to the wire and starts predicting things right as things get confirmed. He's unreliable at best.",Negative
AMD,"thats exactly what im saying lol. Why but last AM5 and then again AM6 when you can buy directly first and last AM6, which you will do anyways, but you just make it more expensive by buying AM5 too ""again""",Negative
AMD,"> Zen 6 is jumping several nodes  > This is also speculation  No it's not, not really. AMD, unless they're morons, will be using whatever current node was on offer, and that's TSMC N2 (N2P/N2/N2X). That's several nodes improved.   > the other half being their own marketing team.  Yeah, I'm in agreement there. Their marketing team, that whole side of AMD is just terrible. And we just ""know"" they're going to name their desktop Zen 6 CPUs with some naming abomination that has ""AI"" all over it.  > It's fine to see rumors and ""leaks"" as entertainment, but to refer to them as a reason to buy X or hold off till Y or whatever is nonsense.  Context/details matter. Ofc one shouldn't hold off a buying decision for a couple years based on rumors that could easily turn out to be wildly off. However, a few months out, when there's substantive leaks from multiple sources, would be a whole different thing.  Obviously Zen 6 (and Intel Nova Lake for that matter) is at least a year out, and ofc has totally unproven performance. All that said, it's hardly any secret what the node jumps make possible, and so AMD *could* do what is rumored, which is obviously not the same as saying they *will* do it.  > The reason we shouldn't credit MLiD when he's right, is because he usually keeps spewing BS until we're down to the wire and starts predicting things right as things get confirmed. He's unreliable at best.  I'm not going to comment on MLiD or any other leaker or Youtuber specifically. People have their opinions, and I can respect those.

AMD,Zen 6 jumping nodes is revealed in public roadmaps though?,Neutral
AMD,"Because we upgrade our CPU's after 7-8 years since the last one? By the time I feel the need to upgrade, if I bought in at the start of a generation, a new gen is already out.

AMD,You are going to see an Intel with Nvidia iGPU in handheld before you see FSR 4.0.,Neutral
AMD,Or any mobile AMD solution at all (laptops began to outsell desktops 20 years ago).,Neutral
AMD,"The workload of FSR4 is pretty “constant” per frame for a given input and output resolution, and it doesn’t care about the original game graphics settings. So a smaller iGPU is going to use too much of the frame time and have too much overhead added.   Navi44 is a 16WGP card.  The Strix iGPU is 8, and Krackan is 4.   For example: At 1080p output, a (14WGP) RX 6700S uses ~3ms to process FSR4, compared to ~2.2ms for XeSS and ~0.7ms for FSR 3.1.5 according to some guys Reddit post.   9070XT (32WGP) was 0.6ms given native FP8.   Even RDNA4 on these iGPU, it would take 4.8ms alone just to run FSR4 upscaling.  Would take your 60fps lower res render down to 47fps. You’d have to get 84fps rendered to get a 60fps upscaled.   That ignores the fact that RDNA4 has physically larger compute units in silicon so it becomes an unfair comparison on an “equal CU” basis.",Neutral
AMD,Isn't there still hope for an official int8 version ?,Neutral
AMD,"Gorgon Point was always supposed to be a Strix Point refresh.  It's basically improved silicon running at higher clocks, that's pretty much it.",Neutral

AMD,And ARM+Nvidia,Neutral
AMD,Won't see FSR4 on handhelds and laptops til Zen 7 or even Zen 8.,Neutral
AMD,"INT8 FSR4 is only DP4a. It needs a WMMA version to be usable on RDNA3/3.5. The only WMMA INT8 version in development is for PS5 Pro's PSSR 2.0, which is a fork of FSR4's upscaler (and maybe FG component).   Technically, most of the code should be usable on RDNA3, excluding any Sony-specific changes. So, it wouldn't really take much extra work to bring it to PC hardware. Non-zero chance. I remain slightly pessimistic about it.   Because PS5 Pro works more with fixed frame rates and varying resolutions, the upscaler algorithms are markedly different vs variable frame rates and relatively static resolutions (like FSR4 Quality's 67% scale or 1440p -> 2160p). This is the largest issue and why PSSR 2.0 is a full fork of FSR4 and could actually have higher overhead as it tries to handle changing image resolutions. Could make it a superior implementation too, especially if it can maintain high upscaled image quality from varied source resolution frames.  WMMA INT8 is 512 ops per CU per clock on RDNA3.   DP4a is roughly 64 ops per CU per clock (4xINT8 ops packed into 32-wide SIMD x2, allowing for quadruple throughput vs a single INT8 op within SIMD32); unfortunately, INT32 cannot use dual ALUs like FP32 can, else output would be 128 ops/CU - this restriction ends in RDNA5 because INT ops are now important for neural rendering and denoising  So, WMMA INT8 (mixed with FP16 for decimal values) allows for an 8x increase in throughput, which will dramatically reduce time per frame.",Neutral
AMD,"Considering how much time has passed, highly unlikely at this point.",Neutral
AMD,Int8 version sucks.,Negative
AMD,"wouldn't make a huge difference. the int8 version is visually noticeably worse and it'll still perform worse on RDNA 3 even with int8 I am fairly certain. It would be fair to call it FSR 3.5, but it's not FSR 4",Negative
AMD,"The other rumour post seems to say even Medusa is rdna 3.5.  Absolutely pathetic if true.

AMD,"yes, AMD's skill issue",Neutral
AMD,"Vega 8 on ryzen 4000 compensated with drastically higher clocks and while it was not memory bound. It was also not “massively better”, far from it.   This thing is going from 2.9ghz to 3.1ghz all the while 890m already stopped scaling beyond low 2ghz never mind much higher.",Negative
AMD,"It is roughly 20% faster than the older generation, pretty decent if you ask me.  Unless you have a crystal ball or works at AMD I recommend you to wait and see",Positive
AMD,Yes because an almost 50% clock increase from vega 11 to vega 8 with a node shrink from GloFlo 12nm to TSMC 7nm is comparable to 6% clock increase on the same node.   Some of you don’t even know discussion of rumours has to have _some_ underlying hardware facts to base off of just because y’all speculate without base you assume everyone does the same.,Neutral

AMD,People with no foresight be like:  but for real though this is not about AMD raising GPU prices without any context. RAM prices doubling or even tripling already in just a few months and now Micron is pulling out of the consumer side completely... you don't need a crystal ball to know prices are going to keep getting worse and not just this one time raise.,Negative

AMD,"AIB's will only maintain the same margin if customers are willing to pay more though. If they raise prices and no one buys, they'll have to come down.  I think prices will go up, but not by 50-100 bucks.",Neutral
AMD,I am affraid that AI bubble is the same as housing bubble. wish thing were different,Negative
AMD,"AI bubble popping doesn't mean what people think it means. It doesn't mean most go out of business and the consumer markets get flooded with products. It means most go out of business and the remaining ones buy up and consolidate all the datacenters and continue operating them and building more. AI isn't going anywhere. Hell, cloud computing is also going to accelerate and those too need lots of datacenters.  The days of affordable gaming died 4 years ago.",Neutral

AMD,Yet it's never been more popular. It's clearly not fucked.,Neutral
AMD,"From what I understood was that Micron is just pulling Ballistix and Crucial which is their direct to consumer lines. Instead they'll be going strictly B2B. There is nothing stopping them from selling their RAM and NAND to other consumer facing companies. For instance...they can still sell VRAM directly to MSI or Sapphire (although I'm pretty sure Micron doesn't really sell consumer GPU VRAM), sell NAND directly to Muskin, or RAM directly to Gskill.",Neutral

AMD,"Not to get super political (I know mods, but it's relevant - hear me out) - the reason that companies engage in this ""chasing margin"" behavior is because of right-wing low-tax policy.    There's no disincentive (in fact, there's a huge tax incentive) to raise prices.  If you want to make a billion dollars, there are two ways to do it - sell a billion things with a $1 profit margin, or 1 this with a $1 billion profit margin.  The structure of the taxes determines which is 'easier' or more highly incentivized.    Our tax system right now awards some of the lowest tax rates to the higher income earners (corporations and very wealthy individuals) - thus it is favorable to raise prices and sell fewer copies of each item.    This is why inflation has been so bad and uncontrollable - because there is a strong incentive to raise prices.",Neutral

Intake fan on front blowing air into the metal hunk, exhaust fan pulling air off of the cooler towards the rear of the case blowing air away from the cooler.   And for fan placement.

AMD,Do you have any examples of this? Raising taxes to lower prices doesn't make intuitive sense.,Negative
AMD,"I would disagree. It is not really political. It is inflation based. Inflation in reality (not in media or political commentary) is preceded by wage disparity. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. Companies are then able to ""markup"" a product and ""limit"" supply, increasing demand. Those with greater wealth will just outbid those with less money, much like an eBay auction. The producers see this and maintain the higher margin, and then raise the bar again to test a new level.    So this problem has been brewing for 50 years and is unlikely to change anytime soon. You need more wealth (greater pay) to the working class and modest middle class and less money to the upper class/mgmt class. Then you would see a reversion to quantity based pricing because more people have more money to purchase goods compared to a concentration of greater wealth into a smaller group of people (where we are today).    We all hate it, but a business has the goal of maximizing revenue. In a world where wealth concentrates into fewer hands, the business has to target that group of people and get them to pay higher margins. It is the world we have allowed our government officials to create for us all the while worshipping the ground they walk on and campaigning for them instead of questioning them.",Neutral

AMD,when will xdna support for directml?   intel and qualcomm npu already supports directml,Neutral
AMD,"What about NPU on Linux? We have the xdna kernel side driver for the NPU, but there's little (if anything at all) you can do with it. It's pretty frustrating.  Edit: just to be clear, the list of supported configurations is pretty confusing. Particularly because ROCm doesn't officially support APUs. What is actually supported/expected to work?",Negative
AMD,Makes me wonder if 6800M is unofficially supported,Neutral
AMD,I'm honestly so disappointed that my 6800 XT is entirely ignored.,Negative
AMD,![gif](giphy|kAuXD4FQ7nnCsWThNw),Neutral
AMD,Probably already support the npu and the unified memory. I only have checked ollama though on my Ryzen AI 350 and it couldn't load big models into unified memory and didn't use the NPU.,Neutral
AMD,"Lemonade is sort of a server - you plug in models to it, somewhat similar like LM Studio, but it's not end-user app - it exposes APIs for other apps, scripts to use those models.",Neutral
AMD,That's an awesome system! I hope Lemonade makes it really easy for you to get started. Find us on our discord any time if you need help.,Positive
AMD,"Amuse, LM studio run great on my XTX. They run deepseek faster than 4090 lol (you never heard the doomers mention this).",Positive
AMD,"I don't think large language models are going away anytime soon, or ever. Theres plenty of genuine uses for them, at least as it pertains to productivity and research. Or simple data analysis (keyword simple).  However, people using them as an alternative to google or using them to feed their delusions can fuck right off. Huge waste of computing power and natural resources. And while AI companies are currently subsidizing this to grow their userbase, they won't be doing so forever.",Negative
AMD,"Microsoft has depreciated DirectML, has not had an update in over a year  I assume this is why Amuse is no longer under development, no more runtime",Negative
AMD,It should work with Lemonade! I just don’t have one on hand to test with. Did you give it a go?,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly! Lemonade is aggregating all the best tools for LLMs on AMD PCs and making it easy. llama.cpp is awesome, but there’s other important tools too. Especially when it comes to using the NPU.",Positive
AMD,How helpful is the NPU,Neutral
AMD,Ollama isn’t really supported. I’ve used lm studio and had good results with Vulcan. Can only get npu to work with lemonade on windows. Also just running llamacpp I compiled myself works the best tbh,Neutral
AMD,"This type of unified memory is still split into RAM and VRAM. Windows needs to support APU architectures which treat it as one large chunk of memory, and both CPU and GPU section can access the same data    PS5's APU comes with cache scrubbers which invalidates cached values. E.g. when the GPU changes some data and this address has been cached by the CPU or vice versa. Apple does similar things with it's Apple Silicon and OS-X.",Neutral
AMD,"My girlfriend has a 6900XT, so we want to make it a joint project to setup LLMs on our desktops. I've joined the discord and look forward to diving into this. Thanks again.",Positive
AMD,I don't think the LLM roleplay userbase even remotely hits 1% of all API calls.,Negative
AMD,Yeah I know. I'm just sick of LLMs being shoved everywhere and taking so much resources and driving up prices.,Negative
AMD,"I sort of love them. I have one running over marqo, with all my HOA restrictions/bylaws/minutes in the database. Every year when the report comes out I ask it to check the report against the other docs and see if anything looks amiss.    Our HOA went from dog shit to pristine the second I showed my neighbor and she told the board.",Positive
AMD,"> Theres plenty of genuine uses for them, at least as it pertains to productivity and research. Or simple data analysis (keyword simple).  To the extent where perfect accuracy is not necessary, of course.",Positive
AMD,"Out of curiosity, what makes you think it would work? It's not listed in their compatibility list on the site.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, I haven't, I looked into it very briefly and just noticed win11 as the only supported system, as I'm on win10. Thank you for the heads-up though",Neutral
AMD,"I don't know since I couldn't really use it yet, because software isn't supporting it very well. The lemonade guys here say that they support it, but that only seems to be true for windows and I am on Linux. The documentation of the project also states, that they use the NPU in some kind of hybrid approach where only the prompt is processed on the NPU until the first token.   I think it will take some time to get support, but in general a 50 TOPS (INT8) NPU should deliver somewhat usable performance for basic lowend stuff while not using much power, but a desktop GPU like the Radeon 7900 XTX or Nvidia x090 will deliver better performance for now.",Negative
AMD,Thanks for the feedback. I'll look into it!,Positive
AMD,"Sounds fun, looking forward to hearing about it!",Positive
AMD,"Setting up a good local LLM is much easier than setting up an actually good local T2I, T2V, or I2V.  Ollama is pretty much 4 or 5 clicks to a good local LLM on Windows. Lemonade seems neat, but Ollama already does everything I need it to do, so I personally don't see a need to try Lemonade ATM.  But for T2I, T2V, and I2V you really need to set up ComfyUI or Automatic1111 for the best results, and that process is more involved, albeit still quite simple as long as you exactly follow the tutorial steps for Radeon on the ZLUDA Github.   The first time I set ComfyUI up it took me about an hour, but now that I know the process, I could have ComfyUI running and generating images/videos on Radeon in \~15 minutes, and most of that would be downloading prerequisites and compiling, so it's really not bad.",Positive
AMD,"I'd actually be really interested to see a breakdown of this from services, but I doubt they would release the data. But I agree, I think its likely to be a very small fraction of people. I wonder if that percentage is larger in paying customers compared to free users.",Neutral
AMD,Likewise my friend,Neutral
AMD,Tell us you're American without telling us you're American...,Neutral
AMD,"Certainly, and everything that they make should be scrutinized for accuracy. But the more time passes, the better they get. My coworkers are turning around graphs and figures (for internal use only) in record time using gemini to plot their numbers. And I've seen the raw data, its surprisingly good at it. It even copies over the typos on labels and annotations, instead of trying to fix them.",Positive
AMD,"Lemonade has a Vulkan backend, and Vulkan lists Radeon 6800 XT as supported.",Neutral
AMD,win10 will probably work for Vulkan on the 6800 XT. I just also don't have a win10 machine to test on!,Neutral
AMD,Indeed GPUs will outperform NPUs for God knows how long. The NPU is all about specialization combined with maximum efficiency. A dGPU doesn't have to worry about maximum efficiency (at integrated within the SoC levels) so it can scale upwards to impressive levels (5090/Blackwell RTX Pro 6000).     Will be cool to see what they can do when we get 100 TOPS NPUs.,Positive
AMD,"I think XDNA2 50Tops is in BF16, which is very good considering it achieves this with only 1-2W and 16-17mm² of die space. The 9070XT(357mm²) has 6x more raw BF16 performance, but what allows it to deliver this performance is its very high bandwidth.",Positive
AMD,"Hi I'm currently running hx 370 with 96gb mini pc as a local llm server using LM Studio, and i use it through the continue extension in vscode. it also has an occulink port that i plan to use with a 9060 xt 16gb on a egpu dock.  For a windows intsall what lemonade setup would you recommend and is it possible to use the models ive download for lmstudio. I also have linus distro CachyOs on the other Nvme drive - what set up would you recommend for that?",Neutral
AMD,"> But the more time passes, the better they get  The point is that they can *never* be perfect by design. It's fundamental to how they operate. Accuracy has not actually increased significantly despite all this extra compute being thrown at it.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah, also just noticed you are a developer on the project, so you would definitely have some knowledge lol. sorry about doubting your comment.",Positive
AMD,"It actually does, and I mean just works way.",Positive
AMD,"Phewph, I'm not touching w11 ever, absolute trash os.",Negative
AMD,"""don't let perfect be the enemy of good"" is something they say. I fucking hate LLMS from their inception, but now I can't deny how useful they can be. And also humans are not perfect either.",Negative
AMD,"> ""don't let perfect be the enemy of good"" is something they say  That's completely missing the point. There are certain things which *require* perfection, and AI makes the sort of mistakes that humans will pretty much *never* make. To use a slightly older but relatable example, it's one thing if AI messes up the proportions of generated art slightly. It's another if it draws extra fingers.  AI does have its uses like you point out, but using it for any serious work that has actual consequences down the line if someone fucks up is not one of them.",Negative
AMD,"I dont disagree with you, and I think youre missing my point as well. Lets just let it be.",Neutral

AMD,"With RAM prices staying stupid high this will be a hard sell for those on older CPU sockets (DDR4), and if you already have a 9800X3D or 7800X3D then the additional 400 MHz do not matter except for the usual benchmarking freaks.",Negative
AMD,"what are these comments bro. If you have a 7800X3D or 9000X3D then of course this new one is not targeted for you. And designing a new architecture versus releasing CPUs on existing ones is two different things, may not even be the same team at work.",Negative

AMD,only if AMD sells it with AM5 32gb RAM combo package.,Neutral
AMD,"Meh, gonna hold onto my 9800X3D and wait for zen 6. I never thought we would see this though.",Neutral
AMD,I guess this is not for 9800x3d owners to upgrade. I am waiting for  Zen 6 12 core single ccd x3d chip to upgrade from 9800x3d.,Neutral
AMD,Cores and memories goes to AI.,Neutral
AMD,"Nah, I’m still waiting for AM6.  I’m actually still satisfied with my AM4 setup.  5900x, X570 Hero, 2x16gb 3200 CL16",Neutral
AMD,"9800X3D has been slowly dropping in price over time, so 9850X3D is just an minor refresh using improved yields and high demand as an excuse to release something  9950X3D2 looks super interesting, it's probably testing the waters for 10 series or something",Positive
AMD,"Been looking/itching to upgrade the 5900x/5080 build, but unless these ram prices fall back down, seems wild to me to make that jump right now.",Neutral
AMD,Does this unlock at fclk2200 or later? 2200 seems too easy to me. I'd be happy if it was released for 9950x as well. I'm not really interested in 9950x3d2.,Neutral
AMD,Great more firewood to ignite.,Positive

AMD,"Well, this is what I needed I'm glad I waited to upgrade my AM4.",Positive
AMD,"Whoa, so it's basically a full speed x3d chiplet now? The 9950x3d2 is even more interesting, two essentially full speed (-100mhz) x3d chiplets.",Positive
AMD,Would be nice if they released this at the same price as the 9800x3d and reduced the price of that chip by a cool 10%,Positive
AMD,"I need x3d2 to upgrade, seriously. Please release that",Neutral
AMD,"So the last budget x3d chip was 5700x3d and i thought amd would give us a 9700x3d or even a ryzen 5 9600x3d full focused on budget gamers. Sad luck, companies really wont give what consumers need!",Negative
AMD,So this means no zen 6 announcement next month.,Neutral
AMD,I wonder if it already has a hard coded PBO +200MHz out of the box or are we actually going to see 5.8GHz PBO+ boosts after users tweak it?,Neutral
AMD,"That sounds good, but I think it's not aimed at users already using Zen 5 processors. Rather, it's aimed at users using high-risk 13th or 14th generation Core processors, and Ultra 200 processors with poor gaming performance.",Negative
AMD,Is it like a 9950x3D with less cores?,Neutral
AMD,"Maybe I’m just an idiot (I am), but aren’t the CPUs being bottlenecked by GPUs currently? So this new CPU won’t really see any difference from a 9800X3D, higher boost clock or not",Negative
AMD,I would buy two right now to replace my 9800x3ds,Neutral

AMD,"AMD will do anything but properly innovate. They hit the jackpot with the 3d cache and are just doing the most MINIMAL changes and pumping out CPUs.   Yet everyone gives them a pass. Hell their 9000 series was a complete nothingburger over 7000, and they cpus are literally BURNING.",Negative
AMD,I have a 9800X3D.  Only thing I’m interested in is a dual CCD chip with dual v-cache.  400mhz is like 4 clicks in Ryzen Master away for any 9800X3D owner with a moderately decent cooler.,Neutral
AMD,"Note that it still doesn't 404. It's also on the English site too, just change ""fr"" to ""en""",Neutral
AMD,Seems like AMD is making sure every part of the stack is secured against Intel. Not that gamers need anything better than a 9800X3D which is way cheaper.,Neutral

AMD,"NGL I think most people hopped to ddr5 when the ram prices were stable and low for the year long stint. Also you atm, for now, can still buy a pre built ddr5 PC to float into the new platform. Might not be the best cause you aren't getting specific parts and they might be crappy parts but it's basically the only way atm to get to ddr5 if you haven't already and be able to upgrade without spending nearly as much as a GPU for ram",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, my 5800x3d will wait for at least another generation before I even start considering any upgrade. I really don't feel any need to upgrade right now, it's still doing whatever I need it to.",Neutral
AMD,These x3d CPUs negate the need for faster RAM,Neutral
AMD,"This is for people that haven't upgraded yet and were waiting for Zen 6 or prices to get even lower, to entice them to buy now with better binned Zen 5 silicon at a premium.  This product is not oriented towards 9800X3D owners.  If you already have one and somehow this speaks to you, get help.",Negative
AMD,But it will future proof me!  Buys 10800x3D on release day…..,Neutral
AMD,And then they will get a 1440/4k monitor and see literally ZERO benefit,Neutral
AMD,"Update: misread 5fps as 5%. Disregard the numbers but the general idea is still the same. This just a new product in the lineup and is a nice bonus option for people who are a few generations behind. It is not a new generation for current gen users to switch to.   -----   A 5% boost in the same generation is pretty neat, since the target is for people upgrading from multiple generations behind.   I won't mind an additional 5% on top of the already amazing gains when I upgrade from my 4690k, and people upgrading from 2500k probably won't be upset either.    Remember when we had to wait an entire generation just to see an hitting for only 10% gains (and that's stretching it)?",Neutral

AMD,"The 9800X3D still an amazing CPU. The new X3D will be  single digit faster at best, and you got it significtantly cheaper. And you wont have to deal with BIOS updates, since every new CPU lauch needs a mobo with the latest BIOS and else the PC wont even POST.",Positive
AMD,Ok but what if you overclock the 9850X3D to 6GHz? :P,Neutral
AMD,Is that doable for everyone?,Neutral
AMD,"The node process likely improved and this lets them cheaply make a ""new"" processor that is highly profitable.  It also keeps them in the news and sometimes is done to steal thunder from a competitor who might be releasing something new and competitive.  This is done independent of the new processor development.  They're coming too.",Positive
AMD,Honeslty if its just a tad more expensive than the 9800X3D and my 4 computers all die at the same time ill buy it for my next build. Otherwise im sticking with my 5800X3D till AM6 comes out,Negative
AMD,"Because they can? The node process likely improved enough that they can eek out a better CPU out of it. No one is losing the opportunity to buy a 9800x3d, those that want the best of the best have access to it and AMD gets to make a bit more money to fund their next generations. It's all a win win win. Why not?",Positive
AMD,"Congratulations, you are in the 1% that doesn't realize these products were never intended to be marketed towards people like you in the first place, but you just felt like upgrading anyway.",Negative
AMD,Next gen is rumoured to bring 50% more cores and introduce new types of cores as well. CPUs are just a difficult thing to innovate with. Additional cache was already a headache to implement and is expensive.   Different cores are good but cause huge scheduling problems.  It's also just funny that you say AMD will do anything but innovate when Zen is a revolutionary architecture that wouldn't be possible without their innovations. AMD already kind of innovated in the most important ways with chiplets and cache. Everything else is a bigger headache to do and not as obvious.  The 9000 series was responsible for allowing X3D chips to be overclocked and was a decent uplift in productivity.,Negative

AMD,"I like how you said ""since 2023"" as it's some ancient time.",Neutral
AMD,"Similar... But my motherboard is ASRock, so I'm scared of frying any x3d that I might get",Negative
AMD,I'm pretty hopeful for the prices to actually be pretty decent. Of course you'll have a scalper period but I really think most will focus on scalping whatever server grade CPU they release alongside this refresh. Hopefully it won't be the year and a half scalp period like we had with the 7800x3d and 9800x3d. I still remember literally seeing a 9800x3d cost the same as a 7800x3d and the 5800x3d being like 50 dollars less at 600$. The x3d v cache hype was real,Positive
AMD,"The only theoretical upgrade would be 5800X3D, but it’s discontinued and not worth it tbh, the performance difference isn’t that big. I’m on 7900XTX and 5800X3D and I’ll probably also hold off until AM6. It still crush anything I throw at it at 1440p.",Negative
AMD,"For games, the only upgrade from the 5700x3D is the 5800x3D.  It's only about 5% faster while also costing a pretty penny ($375-400 used?).  And if you're playing at 4K, the difference will be even less.  I'd look into a minor overclocking the 5700x3D and RAM instead.  I think I bumped mine up another 2% while running -30.  It's only 2% but it was free.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless you can find a second hand 5800X3D, no. I'm on a 5800X3D/4080S combo and I think I'm just going to keep it until AM6 debuts or the RAM debacle blows over, whichever happens first. It still plays most AAA games just fine.",Neutral
AMD,"You are at peak AM4 gaming performance, my man.  As qFrozt said, technically, the 5800X3D is better, but only 1 to 5% faster. Impossible to notice in real gaming.  Just use DLSS to get more frames, for the time being and maybe fine tune your RAM.",Positive
AMD,"Your set till AM6, the cost of ram not worth it.",Negative
AMD,"You won't get any more performance unless your frame rate is below the monitor's refresh rate, which seems quite improbable, unless you spend all your time playing old games.  Any newer games which fail to run faster at that resolution are probably GPU-bound, which means a faster CPU won't mean anything.",Negative
AMD,"if you play 4k there is NO upgrade that will add anything.   Remember, you arent even remotely CPU bound until 1080p. and if you have really any 3d cache for stuff like super select titles itll be fine.   People need to realize that its very very likely that the CPU you have can drive 1440/4k even if its pretty low tier",Neutral
AMD,"Considering the 9850x3d is probably just a better bin with some minor improvements made, and the clocks reported need to be achievable consistently (meaning even those have some performance left on the table), I wouldn't be surprised if at least a sizable portion were able to.",Positive
AMD,"I have an ECLK board and my 9800X3D runs 5.55GHz (or so) boost and 5.4GHz allcore pretty reliably, and still has fine gaming power draw. 24.5K Cinebench R23 score on a liquid cooler for reference.  This'll be fun to see though for non-Eclk boards to let them do 5.8GHz maybe with PBO and some decent chips. Decent perf bump over the \*stock\* 9800X3D at least :)",Positive
AMD,"Not entirely, I've been benchmarking my 9800X3D with EXPO 6000 CL30 vs tuned 6400 CL30 (2133 FCLK) and there's a small increase in average framerate but a noticeable increase in 1% and 0.1% lows.",Neutral

AMD,Was planning an 9950x3D but seriously debating saving for 9950x3D2,Neutral
AMD,Zen 6 X3D should come late 2026 or early 2027.,Neutral
AMD,I highly doubt the price of 9800x3d will go down when they announce the new x3d chip. The 5800x3d sold out and went up in price when the 7800x3d was announced. And then they both sold out and were scalped for months. Then the same thing happened when the 9800x3d chip came out AND the 5800x3d chip was scalped too. I can only imagine this time around the same thing will happen except the 5800x3d won't be scalped but the 7800x3d will. And the 9800x3d and the new x3d chip. That's just a scalpers paradise for a solid few months tbh. You gotta face bot sniping the cpus. Amazon inv luck and so on,Neutral
AMD,"I'm curious about the 9950x3D - do you have any clue if it's worth allocating non-3D cores to non-gaming applications like streaming to friends on Discord, browser, etc., or should I really just get a 9800x3D/9850x3D? I'm lucky enough that money isn't a factor in the decision.  I currently have a 3700x.. so any of those would be an extreme lift in performance lol.",Neutral
AMD,I had your setup and also play on 1440p. Upgraded to a 9800x3d and it made a pretty big difference in performance. 1% lows and top FPS. AM6 is still 4 years away.,Positive
AMD,"My 1% lows are much better on mavel rivals from 5800x3d to 9800x3d with oced 4090 max settings but performance dlss 4k screen. other game it helped was battlefield 6 but again with dlss... saying theirs no improvement is wrong but with the priceing of everything its kinda hard to justiefy unless your kinda in the wierd nitch im in..... If your basicly playing slower paced story games its not worth it at all. Before anyone upgrades cpu, they should check how much % load their gpu is getting during lows. i was getting down to 80% in marvel rivals with the 5800x3d so i know it would help.",Positive
AMD,"Not true, 1% and 0.1% lows improve with an upgrade to 9800X3D,but is it worth $800-$1000?",Neutral
AMD,Literally not true on games like Rust.,Negative
AMD,I need an eclk board,Neutral
AMD,"Interesting, but maybe let me phrase it another way. You can get a much better performing combo with an x3d CPU and cheapest ram vs a non x3d CPU and buying more expensive ram. So. Not that it makes no difference, but that it removes the requirement to have high speed ram for excellent performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It's aimed at me, and people like me who needs extremely fast single core performance and multicore performance but don't want to shell out for the 9950x3D range.   Plenty of applications still really benefit from high single core performance, and having that higher single core performance with 3D V-Cache is a double whammy win.",Neutral
AMD,It has the same cache as the 9800x3d though,Neutral
AMD,"People keep talking shit about cpu performance but at just 180hz with 5700x3d, almost all of my games are cpu limited in one way or another.    If we get a 12 core, 1 ccd, 3d vcache chip next gen, I'm going to creammmm",Negative

I like to do video editing on the side for my motorcycle videos and just overall have the best performance for gaming and productivity. That’s why I went with this cpu instead of just one for gaming. I bundled with the MSI Carbon x870e and no regrets at the amazing performance. I was using a 13700k before and it’s night and day. If you’re on a tight budget get the cheaper option. If you want the best of both and can spend a bit more, get this cpu.",Positive
AMD,"If you can find a way to assign the 8, non 3D-V-cache cores to non gaming workloads, while assigning the 8, 3D-V-cache cores to gaming workloads, and, have both workloads happening simultaneously then, yes, it would 100% be worth doing and be completely awesome while doing so.  There is no game out there that benefits from more than 8 cores that are all on the same CCD and that all have access to the same L3 3D-V-cache.  The reason I am extremely, urgently excited about Zen 6, is the near certainty that there will be at least 12 core CCD's. No latency penalty for all 12 cores with full access to mountains of V-cache, and np need to buy a CPU with more than 1 CCD, if, like me, you primarily want a CPU that is lighting fast for gaming, web browsing, light windows tasks, and the ```occasional render or core centric workloads that really actually benefit from 16 core ( or more )  CPU's. ```  ((`but only occasional multi-core centric workloads like that..... Not frequent enough to warrant a 16 core CPU purchase., .....but just enough so that 8 cores feels slightly insufficient...... That's why a single CCD CPU with evenly distributed 3D-V-cache across the entire CCD, 12 cores, no latency inherent in multi CCD CPU's, and more multi-core centric horsepower than an 8 core CPU could ever provide...... ALL while not stuck in 2nd place in gaming performance behind the 8 core 3D-V-cache variant, which is exactly what happened to both the 7950X3D and the 9950X3D, which were both stuck in 2nd place in gaming performance behind the 7800X3D and 9800X3D, respectively.`))",Positive
AMD,"Yeah I had a 5800X3D, saw a pretty huge performance difference on a 7950X3D. Biggest thing I noticed was being able to run my mouse at 8000mhz without any performance penalty in games, where before I was lucky to be able to run 4000mhz.",Positive
AMD,"The biggest load I put on my CPU is iRacing in VR, but it's an outlier in that respect because the game engine is so old. I'd see significant improvement with an AM5 upgrade, but I straight up refuse to pay more for RAM than any other part of the system save the GPU.",Negative

AMD,The only way to get past +200 from PBO is to use BCLK or ECLK. Unfortunately BCLK multiplies the base clock of everything including the PCIe and RAM meaning overclocking is limited. ECLK only multiplies the CPU clock.,Negative

AMD,"Oh, they will 100% be bailed out in someway. Maybe not openAI directly, but too many companies are leveraged on AI",Neutral
AMD,"Which is why I said that's a different issue. They may exist, they may not. But until that happens, they will be screwing RAM prices for at least 3 years.

AMD,Pedantic. That's not the main point I was making I am aware that v cache CAN help in SOME non gaming tasks.,Neutral
AMD,I'm hopeful this am5 has a breakthrough cpu wise in the future where it makes this whole platform jump worth it in the future. The 5800x3d was revolutionary for the AM4... It's also crazy how little the 5000gpus improved. I think the biggest improvement was ddr5 for the 7000 to 9000 cpus for the way better stable lowes.

AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect.

AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"Yeah, so much of laptop performance is dictated by things other than the cpu. Its kinda wild.   Intel does a way better job getting good laptop designs. Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . .

AMD,I guess the point Intel is trying to make is that it's great for gaming and much better for content creation (aka work). It's also cheaper.  X3d CPU's are only better for gaming (and not in all games). Doesn't mean they are crap but you pay a premium for x3d.,Positive
AMD,"if you think you're 100% correct - go out and buy an x3d and run the tests, post a video with the results, and put an amazon affiliate link in the comments for a 14700k build that overall is better than an x3d.  there's nothing wrong with the 14700k, it's a beast. i think there's a few select games where it even beats the 7800x3d. but there's a reason that you can find hundreds of youtube channels with sub counts up and down the spectrum from 0 subs to 10M subs showing hardware side by sides with the x3d's beating the 14700k - and most of them don't have advertisers to please.  in my opinion, you're getting downvoted because you don't want to provide proof, you're out here saying it's tech tubers fault that you have no proof. you can also find a good amount of open source benchmark data at openbenchmarking.org, it's not pretty - but there's useful data there as well.  but hey - you're only hurting yourself by not breaking open the youtube techfluencer conspiracy around AMD processors. go buy an x3d, do all the testing, and use it as a springboard to free us from the lies of big tech. i'd love for you to be correct, but until you can provide proof, it honestly just looks like you have buyers remorse with your 14700k.",Neutral
AMD,">asking others what scores they’re getting in games. Or If you can afford it, CPUs like 7700X, 14600K, or 14700K aren’t that expensive you can buy them and test for yourself. Just a few games are enough to show RPL processors are far ahead of Zen 4/5 non 3ds CPUs in gaming.

FPS is slightly higher on 14700k/14900k, or is 9.7% higher average FPS on 14900k considered ""far ahead""? Plus, 14900K is not a CPU for gaming, it's a CPU for production workloads plus gaming, which makes it noticeably more expensive than 9700X, so realistically we should compare 9700X to 14600K/14700K.",Neutral

AMD,"I sell PC hardware and get to test a wide range of components. I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU.

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.  Thank you all.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,Unfortunately my Dell warranty support has ended and so far the forum there has not been able to help either. The removal tool works but Killer just keeps coming back.,Negative
AMD,"I also went to Dell, typed in my service tag # and cant find any other ethernet drivers.",Negative
AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral
AMD,An Intel + nVidia handheld would be something I would welcome just for DLSS4 alone.,Neutral
AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it. This will ""hurt"" AMD by offering competition to markets where AMD currently holds a monopoly like with Strix Halo, most handhelds and consoles.  I don’t think we’ll see big changes on the Intel side.  I don’t think this will affect neither the iGPUs nor ARC because why would it.",Negative
AMD,"this jointventure is NOT about consumer gpu and does not change anythig about gaming gpu of intel, amd or nvidia.  this is instantly obvioiusly from just reading the headlines of the news announcing this.   this tumbnail is just hub using this news to suggest jet another time that maybe amd might just be screwed. they do this because they are neutral in every way.",Negative

AMD,They will crush user's wallet,Neutral
AMD,you guys realize Nvidia buys all their stuff from TSMC the same company that makes all of AMD's stuff...So now intel will buy from them too since they cant compete? Because no amount of Intel+Nvidia humping is going to make a TSMC baby...you got to pay to play.,Neutral
AMD,"Even assuming they made monster co-op AMD still has own ecosystem of GPU and CPU, along with consumer support. It's Radeon and Ryzen are still very strong consumer wise. So no, AMD is not screwed",Positive

AMD,"Who knows, time will tell. But if AMD does find its back against the wall, this is when it does its best. This should be interesting to say the least.",Positive
AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Neutral
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral
AMD,So either a 200w igpu with a 300w intel cpu or an intel cpu with a 5030 slapped on it?  I think amd will be fine,Neutral
AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Neutral
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral
AMD,a partnership doesnt mean they get free reign over license lol,Neutral

AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer.

AMD,Never said that.,Negative
AMD,Also a way for Nvidia to invest some of their funny money (which is essentially infinite) into a cheap company. Intel under $20 was ludicrous. Intel is still at book value at $29.,Neutral

AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits.

AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.   I on the other hand don't get why would Intel forfeit it's competitive advantage with GPU accelerated AI, XeSS or QuickSync and made itself dependant on nVidia. Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company.

AMD,Nvidia does not have an A310 competitor.,Neutral

AMD,I have not lied,Neutral
AMD,"While workstations dont directly contribute a big chunk of the sales, I suspect they dont want to yield their foothold on the ML/Data Science guys.  If they start getting familiar with non-nVIDIA ecosystems, it could mean indirect losses when these guys start procuring non-nVIDIA dGPUs in servers when they do port their workstation experiments to ""larger"" hardware now that AI is all the rage.  B60 is gaining momentum on homelabs, and Strix Halo to some extent getting popular for those needing more memory for their larger datasets.",Neutral
AMD,"MLID has used clickbait trash thumbnails/titles way too many times, no one should watch that garbage channel to begin with.",Negative
AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus. Like a b580 destroys the 5060 and 5050 while costing less or the same amount. There's no way nvidia invests 5 billion without some agreement that kills off arc as long as they are together.,Negative
AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Neutral
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Neutral
AMD,"You did tho. It doesn't look like ""later versions of DLSS 2"". Every reputable source has said it's better than DLSS 3 and close to DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Positive

Surface is notorious for being 3 or so quarters after CPU launch.  Look at where MTL is on this schedule, for example. Also around Q2, even though it had been on store shelves technically since the previous year's Q4.

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds.

AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already.

My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral
AMD,What about this post saying APO havent gotten anything in over a year.. https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/s/tTKCn1CnDZ,Negative
AMD,Does anyone know if changing the Windows power plan affects performance? What Windows power plan do you recommend for the i7 14700kf? Balanced? High performance?,Neutral
AMD,I wonder why APO isn't just tied to game mode. That way it would work for all games from ADL to ARL.,Neutral
AMD,"or just get rid of E cores. I know all the non engineers in here think they are great, but real world they are crap, this is just another in a long line of examples of why intel needs to ditch them.   anyway go ahead and downvoted me becuse being correct in this sub is looked down upon.",Negative
AMD,A few years ago you'd have to tweak the hell out of AMD CPUs to get comparable performance to Intel equivalents. Now the tables have turned.  In either case those who know how to tweak will get top performance not matter the platform.     Kudos,Negative

AMD,Congratulations on getting a CPU that didn’t fry itself.  Consider yourself one of the few lucky ones.,Positive
AMD,"It looks like Intel APO almost completely disables the efficiency cores for the game when you look at the screenshots I posted below with per core activity.  But this performance boost likely cannot just be gained by turning off the efficiency cores in the BIOS yourself I wager, because it would be too simple.",Negative
AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.     This sucks because I own BG3, which is one of the new titles they added recently along with Cyberpunk 2077.",Negative
AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.       The DTT driver should be downloadable from Intel, and not from the motherboard manufacturers who cannot be trusted to make the latest version available.",Negative
AMD,The intel software team is pure black magic when they allowed to work on crack.,Neutral
AMD,"Here is a screenshot showing CPU activity across all cores.  This is with HT disabled BTW, and the cooler is an Id FROZN A720.  It looks like the efficiency cores are not engaged in this particular game when APO is enabled.  And Metro Exodus is the only game that I own in the current lineup for the 14900K.  I know they've added some games for Arrow Lake (like Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3) but those games still aren't available yet for the 14900K     [https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png)",Neutral
AMD,"Raptor Lake isn't getting new games for APO.  Which strikes me as greedy, since I'm sure it would work fine. Intel originally said that APO wouldn't work at all on 13th gen, which turned out to be completely false.",Negative
AMD,"When combined with Nova Lake's bLLC, it could give Intel a major edge over AMD's X3D.       And yeah, limiting it to certain games and certain CPUs is a real downer for the technology, so hopefully Intel can find a way to streamline and expand it when Nova Lake launches.",Positive
AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral
AMD,Or... Just process lasso.,Neutral
AMD,Because it’s optimizations on how it can efficiently use the cpu.,Neutral
AMD,Must the App be downloaded? Or it's automatic after installing the PPM and DTT drivers?,Neutral
AMD,"All of this stuff is super situational. For when it’s supported for my 14th G, I love it.  To call it better than X3D though? That’s a bit much.",Positive
AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's a pretty cool, yet simple idea. It would be really nice to give users more granular control natively.",Positive
AMD,Are the e cores clustered in order so we would be able to manually achieve this with process lasso?,Neutral
AMD,Why should game devs be automatically expected to specifically optimize their game for specific architectures of Intel's CPUs? It's not on them to do so.,Negative
AMD,You need to download the Intel Application Optimization app from the Windows store,Neutral
AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there. I hope they fund them properly and don't go the AMD route of having Ryzen and Radeon not work together due to pride.",Positive

AMD,I love Intel but with how the company is doing right now I’m in a “I’ll believe it when I see it” type of skepticism.,Positive
AMD,"Sorry I am making unreasonable requests. Can you test the game with APO on, and a few background tasks ? Like a few browser tabs, a youtube video playing, discord etc ? I am interested in the E-core usage, particularly the spread of E-core usage.   Thanks.",Neutral
AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative

AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Negative

AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler).

AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right?

AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.

AMD,This is wrong. Arrow Lake already uses E cores for gaming to no performance hit.   12-14th Gen sure. But not with the new E cores and no HT. You’re using dated info.,Negative
AMD,"A number of public tests have shown that, even with all the P-cores disabled, ARL is still pretty good in gaming.  It's not the E-cores.",Positive
AMD,No different to 12-14th gen then.,Neutral
AMD,"windows pretty much gave up on this and just allows you to set to performance mode, which always tries to grab a P core first.",Neutral
AMD,"Or that I forgot they don't have HT on the newer chips.   To be honest I was meaning 14th gen P and E cores with more cache not the new gen stuff. We know the IPC, memory controller and core speed is enough it's just the cache that makes it fall behind AMD in gaming.",Neutral

AMD,HT is worse than E cores,Negative
AMD,>Intel's Nova Lake processors are expected to feature the memory controller integrated back into the CPU tile  They aren't,Neutral

They built out all they needed for their own internal 18A demand too.",Neutral
AMD,"It shouldn't become an entry level workstation part since the Ryzen 9 will have 24c/48t to go against it.   48 cores (plus the 4 LPe, but those shouldn't factor in too much) should handily beat 48 threads, but not by enough to reach Threadripper territory.",Neutral
AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral
AMD,"Lmao, some of my games still runs on e cores",Neutral
AMD,People are still disabling e cores for more performance.,Neutral
AMD,"Varients because there are two tiles. One with BLLV, one without. Full chip had 1 BLLC chip and 1 without. No actual SKU (not tile) without BLLC in some way so far",Neutral
AMD,"They are nothing like P-core as designed with no hyperthreading, area/space efficienct and integrated into clusters of 4 e-cores with shared L2 cache",Neutral
AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Neutral
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral
AMD,"As a advice, Nova Lake will further increase memory latency.",Negative
AMD,In which gen iteration?,Neutral
AMD,Editorialized. But its funny because said quote is attributed to AMD when Intel made Core2Duo (or Quad?),Neutral
AMD,"If its is with 10% of threadripper 9960x at half the price, it will definitely hurt the low end threadripper cpus a lot for productivity/creator types who would love a more reasonable priced high performance entry level workstaion. Low end workstation is probably bigger market than high end gaming desktops anyways.",Negative
AMD,"Another factor is that Apple has booked out all the N2 capacity for the better part of a year before AMD can touch it.  Nova Lake will have been out for a while, before AMD shows up",Neutral
AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral
AMD,That is more so bc the 9950x3d isn’t really a 16 core cpu it is two 8 cores,Neutral
AMD,"There was one article a while back that reported something like ""intel goes back to integrated mc"", not understanding that panther lake is a fundamentally different product than the tile based desktop products.",Neutral
AMD,How do you think they're doing 2 compute tiles if the memory controller is on one?,Neutral
AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel will definitely decrease latency with Nova lake and as long as they add a bigger L3 cache variant, gaming performance will increase further to challenge AMD",Positive
AMD,"If you go straight to the source, the quote they used is directly on Intel's slides. Intel literally wrote that, regardless of who said it first.   [https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPtQr2PKSemDqkhahtz8VN.jpg)",Neutral

AMD,"NVL high end desktop skus are rumored to be on N2 as well. Intel has confirmed NVL desktop will be on TSMC, and Intel has also confirmed some NVL compute tiles will be external.   It's very possible Zen 6 DT is out before NVL-S, and it's very likely that NVL-S and Zen 6 launch within a few months of each other, if that even.   Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD stacks the cache directly on top (9000 Series) or under (9000 series) the CPU cores, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!! A decked out 256GB Arrow Lake z890 based computer is way cheaper than same memory sized threadripper 9960x.",Positive
AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative
AMD,"Yup.   >. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So, you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside.  Q4 2024 earnings call.",Neutral
AMD,"That seems really strange, since ARL was designed for both 18A and N3, and they just went with N3 at the time.  Now that 18A is ready, and capacity is reserved for Intel themselves, you'd think NVL would just plain be fabbed there.  Maybe the 18A fabs are so busy with Clearwater Lake orders, that they would go with TSMC again?  That seems like something they couldn't have known in 2024.",Neutral
AMD,"18A is about as good clockspeed as N2, but density is still around N3 level. To make a new architecture, it makes sense for them to target N2 if AMD does the same which they have",Neutral

AMD,I would love to see a Nova Lake-A (strix halo like) APU with an 8+16 tile + 20Xe3 cores which is equal to 2560 FP32 lanes or 40 AMD CU's with 16-32mb of memory side cache to handle igpu bandwidth demands,Positive
AMD,Is anyone left?,Neutral
AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

For this to be a meaningful upgrade, you'd want more than 20 Xe3 cores, which means you need more bandwidth, which means you need probably LPDDR6 memory to get it high enough as otherwise the cache demands would be prohibitive and LPDDR6 memory isn't coming to client until probably 2027.",Neutral

AMD,The 7850HS can't compete with the Xe2 igpu because it's bandwidth starved.   The 8mb of memory side cache insulating the 4mb of L2 from main memory allows the Xe2 Arc 140V igpu in LL clocked at 1950mhz to beat the RDNA 3.5 890m clocked at 2950mhz as it only has 4mb of L2 as a last level of cache before hitting memory.

AMD,I will see the performance envelope of PTL U and decide should dump my LNL or not,Neutral
AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral
