Intel,I thought that was Denis lol,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah this is a really surprisingly open factory tour, at least compared to when Sapphire took Linus and Alex along. It feels unprecedented to see this much access and insight, but that's the goodwill nurtured by Steve paying off in spades. The lament about AMD and Nvidia ditching the sub-250 side is real, so having Arc actually be a usable option down here is going to be significant later on.",Positive
Intel,"Pretty good video with a lot of detail I haven't seen in previous factory tours. I probably still won't use an Intel GPU for gaming, but for a media server it's probably sufficient.  Side note: It's funny how whenever a GN video gets posted, the same cast of characters comes out and writes essays criticizing the video, apparently without watching it. I guess that's what it means to ""make it"".",Positive

Intel,"Woah, a GN video that is actually interesting and informative for once instead of just ranting about the fact hardware companies exist to make money, not please gamers.",Positive
Intel,That hat is so useful,Positive
Intel,Making them isn't important selling them is.  The reality is that this segment doesn't actually exist it has no buyers in it.  Seems intel is truly doomed trying to win segments that if they even exist aren't big enough to pay back their R&D even if the dominate them.,Negative
Intel,"To be fair this is not a clean room, just SMT assembly. Basically, soldering components. A lose hair might be a bit of a problem (kind of like in any factory), but his hair is tied and doesn't seem to be an issue.

Intel,"It’s crazy. I think Steve and GN are doing the lords work with their nonstop, accurate coverage of the absolute shit state of the computer component markets and the megacorps that perpetuate it.

Probably the same mfs that bought MKBHD’s wallpaper app lmfao",Negative
Intel,"Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket. To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of similar performance or even outperforming the cards in those brackets.

Intel,"They're talking about the A310 and A380, of which Nvidia doesn't have anything made in this decade to compete with and AMD has the 6400 that came out 5 years ago.  The only cards with modern features in that price segment that consumers can directly buy are the A310 and A380.",Neutral
Intel,He(Lucas) stated $100 was the market that was abandoned.  10:37  > Steve: So why still making A310?  > Lucas: Because what's the competitor have? Nvidia? like... GT710? GT1030? (laughs) No way. So literally Nvidia AMD already give up the segment of this like... $100 price card.,Neutral
Intel,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

Intel,B580 has 12gb of vram though,Neutral
Intel,"Sad that all of those are 8gb cards. Even if comparable or faster than the B580 aside from that, the lack of vram makes them far inferior products imo.",Negative
Intel,I just wish all of those options were more compelling tbh. I think what Steve was trying to say was that AMD and Nvidia have just half assed that market segment at the expense of the consumer. All these being 8gb cards for $250-$300 is kinda ridiculous in 2026. I’ll take a b580 over a 9060xt 8gb or 5060 any day of the week.,Negative
Intel,Go to r/PCMasterrace and they will downvote you into oblivion for even MENTIONING the possibility of gaming on a 5060 let alone 5050 XD,Negative
Intel,The title is just playing the YouTube algorithm game. It's stupid but they have to do it.,Negative
Intel,"> Love how 5050 is actually at msrp now cheapest b580 is $349+  Just an FYI but B&H has the [Acer Nitro B580 for $249.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1874395-REG/acer_dp_z4bww_p01_nitro_oc_arc_b580.html) and the [Intel Limited Edition model for $259.99](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1869297-REG/intel_31p06hb0ba_arc_b580_limited_edition.html). So you can get B580 for MSRP, but for how long who knows.",Positive
Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive
Intel,"I see b580 for € 260. That's VAT included. rtx5050 is similarly priced.     And i found $300 lot on US amazon.  Considering other post, maybe search better than 1 place or something.",Neutral

Intel,I do not know if the numbering scheme from my workplace is common across the industry but the smt assembly would be in a class 5 or 6 clean room and the fabrication itself would be a 1 or 2 class clean room,Neutral
Intel,"I think it still matters to a certain point, thats why everyone in the factory is wearing a hat. The Factory boss decided to roll RNG dice and say *""Fck it, that small hat is fine, even tho wearing it is pointless now; I'll just pray nothing bad happen*"". lol  What hilarious is when you think about what going through uninformed factory-employee's head, after they saw some guy(Steve) walk-into the factory like that. Definitely a lot of ""WTF"" moment going through their mind lmao.",Neutral

Intel,This sub is genuinely weird. They complain about PCMR when the level of discourse here is much worse and a lot more mean spirited.,Negative
Intel,"They are truly rage baiting drama mongers sadly. The fact that the causes they support happen to be semi legit and consumer friendly in nature does not take away from the fact that they are essentially drama and negativity for profit at this point, and often out of touch with reality. You can be positive, polite, and have reporting standards while still calling out shitty behavior and ripping bad practices to pieces.   Companies are not your friend. That includes GN. They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative
Intel,"Might be just the thing for older machines and a GNU Linux (or BSD like) migration. Or as a pass through GPU to Jellyfin, Emby, or Plex for media transcoding. Edit: or Small form computing tied together with a iGPU enhancing game performance...",Neutral
Intel,yeah there is a reason the a310 cards they are making are 4 hdmi out.  Gotta know your market,Neutral
Intel,I assume those are being marketed to OEMs who make digital billboard systems or something. No idea why else you would want 4 HDMI ports on a card.,Neutral
Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive

Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
Intel,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
Intel,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
Intel,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
Intel,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
Intel,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
Intel,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
Intel,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
Intel,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
Intel,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
Intel,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral

Intel,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option.

Intel,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
Intel,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
Intel,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
Intel,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral

Intel,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
Intel,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
Intel,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
Intel,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
Intel,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
Intel,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
Intel,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
Intel,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Negative

Intel,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Positive
Intel,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
Intel,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same. So it also pulls 60W on battery.

It's essentially a 9950x (so all P-cores) with a fat iGPU attached, and with a 4 channel memory controller instead of 2-channel.",Neutral
Intel,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
Intel,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
Intel,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral
Intel,Single Core is very important when Intel is doing these designs that lack P cores throughout. The cheapest X2 Elite has the same amount of P cores as the most expensive Panther Lake SKU,Neutral
Intel,"Qualcomm is already super close with Oryon V3...  Perf/Watt for that single thread isn't close I guess, but absolute performance is breathing down Apple's neck for sure.  Also, don't compare Geekbench scores on windows vs Linux/Apple/Android... Windows just does something negatively about it and the difference is 5-7% vs non-windows.",Neutral
Intel,>Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens.  I would be shocked if this has much to do with a large performance uplift. I imagine it would have to do more with rightsizing core area and power draw.,Negative
Intel,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
Intel,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
Intel,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral
Intel,"What is possible? PS5 uses GDDR6 instead of DRAM. And consoles are heavily subsidized by digital purchases. I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative
Intel,Even their Ryzen 5 AI 340 laptop are too expensive and you can buy an older gen Ryzen 5 with Nvidia GPU laptop for same price or even lower with much better GPU performance.,Negative
Intel,"To be frank, high end mobile gaming is also pretty niche.   There are edge cases for AI.   However, the pricing for strix halo was just awkward. At the price levels their SKUs were coming, you might as well go with a nice M4 max and call it a day.",Negative
Intel,Local AI (not just LLM) is universal on mobile and getting to be universal in corporate computers. You just dont see it. The background blurring in Teams meeting? 5x more battery efficient with AI. But its just going to be integrated into Teams and fire up if hardware supported without asking you.  >Any real life business use case of AI is cloud based no question asked.

Intel,"140T (Arrow Lake) isn't the same as 140v (Lunar Lake) though, the former is usually quite a bit weaker and inconsistent in games despite slaying all the synthetics.",Negative
Intel,"It is probably because the AIO was one of their most, if not the most recent RTX 4050 tested (March 17th 2025) which probably enabled them to compare in newer title like F1 25 in the article, as it has already been around for like 3 years while RTX 5050 was released last year and received more attention in its place overall. From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral

Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.

Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.

Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.

Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral

The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative

Intel,"Intel already talked about this a couple months ago. It's not an announcement here, but it seems people are more interested in AMD and Nvidia news so those threads don't get as much traction.",Neutral
Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles. Console gamers just don't give a fuck lol....   DF did a good video showing this truth with the Silent Hill 2 remake.",Negative
Intel,"With a lot of PS3 games dipping to 20s, I guess we are just paying more attention to it now",Neutral
Intel,There was DF Clip of this exact question.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxsfT4c-F-Q,Neutral
Intel,They're more surgery stuttery.,Negative
Intel,Everyone hates MLID,Negative
Intel,Funny piece of lore. Why so?,Positive
Intel,Who's MLID?,Neutral
Intel,If the end visuals are better who cares. we already did a lot of such things in engine just didnt tell the players about it. One in four frames actually rendering shadows is a thing for example. Heck some games go as bad as once a second shadow updates.,Negative
Intel,"Well, I think that most people (myself included) don't really care how it's done if the end result is looking good and feel good to play, off course something like 30fps based with MFG to 120 is bs, but I quite regularly use 60 -> 120 using frame gen because It feels okay input wise to me at 60, and the added visual smoothness is quite nice. So it all depends how it's implemented and talked about.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah i had to tap out a couple months back. it's a shame, they did great work, but i refuse to support ragebait.",Negative
Intel,"Doesn't help that there isn't any particular new hardware to review or anything new besides AI, the PC industry has hit stagnation in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"In other news, guy who is being served turds at restaurant loudly complains about receiving fat dooks instead of food.     *""man that guy is such a whiner""*",Negative
Intel,"No it didn’t sound like they were going to use the MS shader delivery program. Or no, they said they want to, but they have their own solution that they’ll launch before that.   And I also don’t think the MS solution is ready. The ROG ALLY XBOX also doesn’t have this feature already as far as I know",Negative
Intel,"> The Shader delivery program was launched on an AMD handheld  i assume you're referring to the steamdeck, which to my understanding was done by valve... so the point kinda stands, you just add valve to the preamble.",Neutral
Intel,"I dunno I remember many games, especially based on Quake engine, being buttery smooth if you could get to reasonable FPS",Neutral
Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral
Intel,MLID more like MID,Neutral
Intel,He’s been calling Tom a “snake oil salesman” for performance claims on Alchemist,Neutral
Intel,"Moore's Law is dead, he's a YouTuber who makes predictions and purports to have insider information from Nvidia/Intel/AMD but in reality he is better described as FanFiction for PC enthusiasts.",Negative
Intel,"I worry about things like latency.  Or what happens when you move suddenly, or fire, and the whole image falls apart.  If the hardware can't do it all yet, then wait a few years instead of using these... methods.  And just to be clear, I think very highly of  Mr. Tom 'TAP' Petersen; I'm just not liking where this is all heading.  Are you happy with Borderlands 4 or Outer Worlds 2?  If you are then we live in two different worlds.",Negative
Intel,"There's plenty of old stuff he needs to review. I've said it before but I will say it again and beat it like a drum: He STILL has not reviewed the 9060 XT 8GB for instance. Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative
Intel,No wonder that strategy has proved successful. There are a lot of people that only care about complaining and bitching. Which I get up to a point but it starts to feel childish and pathetic quickly.,Negative
Intel,"I love how reddit down votes you,  reddit posts all day complaining about the industry, GN does a video on it   Redditors ""whiney cry baby engagement farmers """,Negative
Intel,"Valve does have one on Steam, but Microsoft announced a store agnostic, eventually hardware vendor agnostic one launched with the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X last year.  It was supposed to be working already but there's no sign of it just like everything else Microsoft releases about gaming half-baked like their gaming UI, their attempt to unify upscaling, and Directstorage.   So I imagine they're referring to what Microsoft called ""Advanced Shader Delivery"" that they've done little with but name and announce to sell more Asus Pretend-Xbox's.",Neutral
Intel,I’m talking about the Xbox Ally as the other commented said,Neutral
Intel,We considered solid 60 or 75 smooth back then. Now at least I complain as soon as I can't stay above 100.,Negative
Intel,"Shader compilation stutter is a PC problem that’s been especially bad in UE4 and 5 since the transition to DX12. Other types of stutter and bad frame rates used to be equally bad on consoles, or even worse in the 360/PS3 era.",Negative
Intel,Outer Worlds 2 is fairly consistent for a UE5 game. To me its just very heavy,Neutral
Intel,"funny coming from MLID, notorious snake oil salesman",Negative
Intel,"Eeeegh, considering MLID overall story - can see that, can see that.  OTOH usage of such terminology - snake oil salesman - reminds me of that very infamous Intel presentation...",Negative
Intel,You say that as if we will reduce our base frame rate. But the direction of travel is to use MFG to drive the 480Hz and above monitors that will become more and more common in the future.,Neutral
Intel,I dont like borderlands franchise and i havent played Outer Worlds 2 yet so i cannot comment on them from personal experience. However things like Reflex/Reflex2 has actually decreased latency for me.,Negative
Intel,"I havent really seen it as some sort of drama farm, I think a lot of GN's videos do show how bad the current computer hardware hobby is doing and Im glad someone is focusing on that",Negative
Intel,Whata wrong with calling companies out? Like redditors cry all day but stop at GN when the channel brings up issues within an industry.  Sorry a person isn't running their channel the way the reddit collective wants.,Negative
Intel,"honestly, i had completely forgotten that was a thing.   i wish i had more faith in microsoft to pull this off, but i remain skeptical in basically anything they try until proven otherwise.",Negative
Intel,"People on gaming forums used to go around insisting the human eye could not distinguish greater than 60fps.  It was accepted as gospel in many places/by many people.  Granted, that was in the age of CRTs and almost no one had actually seen >60, but funny to think back on.",Neutral
Intel,snake oil salesmen dont like competition.,Negative
Intel,"MLID aka ""RTX 50 super will be released november 2025""",Neutral
Intel,this just makes me like tom more,Positive
Intel,"Replace that 60 with 30. Yes, people insisted we could not see more than 30 even while playing on 85hz CRTs.",Neutral
Intel,"Meanwhile quake players kept dropping resolution to hit triple digit refresh rates :) But yeah, it's wild that 30 was the norm for so long on console",Neutral
Intel,That's far from the worst prediction he's missed.  Remember SMT4 for future Zen architectures? 24 and 32 cores on desktop Zen4? L4 cache for Zen 4?,Neutral
Intel,Which Tom?,Neutral
Intel,"console used to lock at 60, dont know why they choose to drop down to 30.",Negative
Intel,"Because when the hardware cant handle all the sprites, it slows everything down including game logic which was tied to frame rate back then. It happens in plenty of hardware from snes to arcade cabinet.",Negative
Intel,"also happened the other way round, older games would run faster than they should because they tied it to framerate rather than delta time. This bad practice was so common you can still find studios like bethesda do this.",Negative
Intel,"for context, this G14 was the one that gave us [the first ever Geekbench scores for Panther Lake](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ocaslx/panther_lake_geekbench_leak_its_good/) over on r/hardware",Positive
Intel,"The price probably wasn't going to be low enough compared with other SKUs.  In the past, Intel skuss with Iris HD etc were so expensive and were only included in $2000 ultrabooks. This is probably going to be same.",Negative
Intel,When I first learned about I was confused why it existed. Not surprised Asus decided to cancel it.,Negative
Intel,"It makes sense, a B390 only G14 kind of defeats the whole purpose of the Zephyrus, even as a base model.     Basically brings the GPU performance down to 3060 levels (actually a little worse than that), which is roughly 4 years ago at this point.",Negative

Intel,"It would have made _some_ sense, but the Arc B390 must’ve been real good. But as you say, with the raise in RAM prices, you can forget about it.  I wonder whether Intel themselves would pair a mid-range Panther Lake with a top-notch iGPU… It would make sense, since the high-end CPUs tend to have dGPUs.",Neutral
Intel,"For the Zephyrus you can also just disable the dGPU to game only on the iGPU, and the customers of the Zephyrus are minimum looking for a decently powerful dGPU",Neutral
Intel,I hope their plugged out power scheme is permanent and doesn't vary based on application,Neutral
Intel,"> so what's the point of having a powerful GPU on a laptop if I got to plug in all the time  I have a laptop for travelling. I travel to places that have plugs, and I don't need to use a laptop while I am actually in transit.",Neutral

Intel,"Useable, yes, but what customers of the Zephyrus are looking for, no.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and it gets pretty good battery life on that and in power saving mode/60fps screen mode. Like 8 hours. Best I've had on a gaming laptop- not a high bar, but it's nice to be able to take it into the living room and use it light a normal laptop instead of it dying instantly.",Positive
Intel,Still better than 45 minutes  Also it can obviously be put in a lower power mode to save battery while not hurting performance too drastically.,Positive

Intel,"The B580 has 200W TDP, in a perfect world and TDP scales linearly, the B770 would be 50% faster, that would put it around the 5060Ti/9060XT.  If the price also scales linearly, that would be around 375€, seeing that the 9060XT is going for 350€ now, it's gonna be tough competition.",Neutral
Intel,Im really looking forward to panther lake X. 4-4-4 core configuration and Xe3 iGPU with sr-iov is perfect for running a Linux-Windows mixed vm environment without having to get a gaming laptop with a dedicated GPU for virtualisation.,Positive
Intel,I hope the Linux driver support and performance is good in these,Positive
Intel,"Intel ARC needs to maintain their momentum. They have an excellent pricing strategy and genuinely compelling features, it's time they released a card that competes in the midrange. And no, I don't count the A770. As a B580 owner, increased ARC adoption rates will be sure to benefit all cards in the range, so I really hope that intel is committed for the long-haul here.

Intel,"Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds. That however will mean a bigger die and viability might be questionable (considering they're already massive for the performance).",Negative
Intel,"Price doesn't scale linearly because die sizes make defects scale quadratically. so pricing is the same, 2 50mm\^2 dies are cheaper than 1 100mm\^2 die     However in GPUs there is a fixed cost for every GPU so there is a sweet spot",Neutral

Unless Battlemage is seriously memory bandwidth-limited, it should be almost 50% more performant.  The only question is die size.

Intel,"The B50 is not a gaming GPU and actually underperforms in gaming tasks compared the the B580. They need to have an actual range of cards, not just a budget option, and even more budget option, and a server/workstation GPU. The B770 is essential to compete in the midrange",Negative

Intel,"> Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds.

They can't really afford not to use every bit of die space they have for all that its worth.",Negative
Intel,"Battlemage doesn't have the ability to add more Xe cores per render slice, this is something Intel has changed for Xe3. The BMG-G31 will have 128 ROPs, the same as an RX 9070 XT, or more than an RTX 5080.",Neutral

Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress.

Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency.

Intel,"For the use cases of PTL, Geekbench (which is mostly consumer focused) is a good indicator.  It doesn't assume that its workloads are perfectly parallel, it assumes some threads are used more heavily than others, so its value in nT is influenced by its 1T.

It would also strongly indicate that Intel’s 18A node indeed offers significantly better energy efficiency than TSMC's N3B.",Negative

Intel,"Couple of subtests leverage some new arm vector instructions and get huge scores, but those have limited influence to the overall score.

One difference is that since geekbench is distributed as binary it’s compiled more directly for apple architectures specifically while others use more generic targets. But that has very limited effect.",Neutral
Intel,But they have a gpu compute test too,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench claims it's much more realistic than those multicore tests that scale nearly perfectly with tons of cores, and I think that's a fair take. It's not as if they didn't know how to create a benchmark that scales like other nT tests do, geekbench 5 nT does that.   I wouldn't call it worse, just different.",Positive
Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Well, we already had rumors of Intel struggling to hit actual intended frequency-goals, no?  Though especially the actual performance-metrics of the node will be quite sobering I think.  The power-draw of these SKUs is supposed to be a TDP of *officially* 25W – In reality, these parts are allowed to draw as much as 55W (2+0+4 or 4+0+4) and 65/80W (4+4+4 and 4+8+4) respectively.  So it must be seen, if these parts are any more efficient in daily usage, or just a side-grade to Lunar Lake.",Negative
Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.  I'm not talking 300W monster CPUs, but the scaling between a 65W and 105W 18A CPU should be more significant than on current nodes, where you might gain like 10-15% additional performance from that 50% power bump.

For that you'd want to look ahead to 14A where the CFO mentioned on the earnings call (and he was somewhat realistic in other areas so it's more believable here) that 14A has been a positive surprise and they're actually pretty excited about it.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral

Intel,For both 12th and 13th gen you can do the following:  - turn hyperthreading off - enable only 8 ecores - Set a negative voltage offset of - 0.050  Play games for a couple of hours if no crashes then decrease offset by another 0.025 (I.e. 0.075). And keep going till you find the lowest voltage without crashes. This will increase 1% lows tremendously in games too.   Once you're stable and if temps are still too high (thermal throttle) then you can reduce clock speed by 100hz and keep doing it till you're happy. Reducing by 200mhz doesn't hurt gaming performance.  Benchmark a CPU limited game (or make it CPU limited by lowering the resolution) before you start so you can see the gains.,Neutral

Intel,"If the B580 has good performance in the game that you are interested in then it can be a good option. However, in some games there are driver overhead issues. So you cant trust every benchmark with a 7800x3d/9800x3d to estimate the GPU performance. In some games performance is reduced with a Ryzen 5 5600 for example. If this has been fixed in your games (or you have a stronger CPU) then the b580 is a good choice.",Positive

Intel,"So the 9th gen is a bit of a weird CPU right now, you do have a couple of decent upgrade options, but also you cannot go past the 9th gen without a new motherboard. Also the 9th gen is quickly coming up on 6 years old now as well.   My affordable advice would be to grab a 9700k and a better CPU cooler, then you can start to worry about the GPU which is very PSU dependent anyways. Without knowing the PSU I cant really make a suggestion anyways.   But the truth is, I would almost start fresh. New mobo, cpu, PSU and GPU. It would be more pricy, but also a far better use of your money than dumping it into a system that will be too slow to run new games in just a year or two.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, really both kinda. 6500 XT is a notorious shite GPU but the games you play are CPU bound so a new CPU would do wonders. Budget is needed here.",Negative
Intel,"I have the ASRock H310CM-HDV with an i5-9400. The beta BIOS will add Smart Access Memory (a.k.a., resizable bar). This may improve GPU performance...depending on game.  An i9-9900 is in the $200+ range. An i7-9700 is in the $100+ range. The i9-9900's \~24% performance gain is questionable for \~100% increase in price. There are other options between your i3-9100f and the i7-9700...

Intel,"All the games you play avoid the problem of having a weak but modern gpu very well. Assuming you dont suddenly decide to play something more graphically intensive i reccomend upgrading your cpu seeing how it feels, then upgrading your gpu. The immediate option that comes to mind is the i5 9400f. It should be an approximate 25%-30% improvement in most of the games like cs2 due to the added cores, threads and clock speed compared to that fairly weak i3 cpu. Then you could do something like an RX 6600 for $120 if findable, if not I usually reccomend the 3060 12gb as a braindead midrange option still able to play anything, it's about 200.",Neutral

Intel,"What is your budget for upgrades?  Your GPU is currently being held back by your platform. The 6500XT only has PCIe x4, and LGA 1151 only has PCIe 3.0. 3.0x4 bottlenecks the card pretty badly, going from on par with an RX 580 to worse than an RX 570. Getting onto a newer platform with PCIe 4.0 would improve both your CPU and GPU.",Negative
Intel,"What you could/should upgrade depends entirely on budget. The CPU is nearly the slowest 9th gen Intel chip, so an upgrade there would help a lot. The ""Best In Slot"" CPU is the i9-9900K but those go for nearly $200 on eBay. You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game. The GPU is also the slowest of the 6000 series. As far as new GPUs go, the Intel Arc B580 12GB at $250-$300 or the Radeon RX 9060XT 16GB at $380-$400 are best bang for the buck on the cheaper side, your options really open up on the used market. Go to the [Techpowerup specs page](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6500-xt.c3850) and check out the Relative Performance of your card with faster ones. I would upgrade to something at least 200% relative performance or higher if you can afford it. Between the GPU and CPU, I'd say the GPU upgrade should take priority over CPU. While a much newer GPU might be bottlenecked by the 9100F, its vastly superior performance will leave the 6500XT in the dust. GTX 1080ti (\~$150) RTX 2080ti (\~240) RTX 3060ti (\~$220-250) RX 6750XT ($280-350) RX 6800 (\~$300) RTX 3080 (\~$350) all examples of decent used options that are considerably more powerful than the 6500.",Neutral
Intel,Adding a 9700K isn’t gonna fix the fact the GPUs being bottlenecked by PCIe 3.0.  An R5 3600 and a cheap B550 board would probably cost not much more than an 9700K and improve the GPUs performance quite a bit. It would still work with the 16GB DDR4 they already have.,Negative
Intel,I have seen many videos on how it is a bad card I haven’t had no problems so far but definitely on my list,Neutral
Intel,LGA 1700 isn’t worth recommending at all. DDR4 performance has aged terribly because newer games are more memory demanding. DDR4 boards have also gone up in price a lot.   HUB revisited the Ryzen 5000 series last week and included a 12400F on DDR4 and DDR5 for comparison (https://youtu.be/RijAyVshtok?si=NbuCRlSV4uhHOzlv) - the 12400F on DDR4 performs closer to an R5 5500 nowadays than the R5 5600 it used to compete with.,Negative

Intel,"What? A lot of the review coverage for the 6500XT was about how bad the PCIe bottleneck is. The 6400 and 6500XT are unique in that they’re PCIe x4, even current lower-end cards like the Arc B570 and RTX 5050 are PCIe x8  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6500-xt-pci-express-scaling/28.html TPU saw a 24% drop from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p  https://www.techspot.com/review/2398-amd-radeon-6500-xt/ Techspot saw a 22% drop in averages and 25% drop in lows from 4.0 to 3.0 at 1080p   I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s even worse nowadays, games demand more VRAM now than they did 4 years ago. More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.  If you don’t know what you’re talking about, don’t comment lol",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m not stupid.  You are far better off going for Zen 3 over anything on LGA 1700.   The R5 5600(X) performs as well with DDR4 as the 12400(F) does with DDR5.  Used they both go for ~$100-120, new both are ~$170 right now. AM4 boards tend to be cheaper and the RAM is the exact same.  Why would you spend more on LGA 1700 to get worse performance?",Neutral
Intel,"My real-world experience with low-end cpu power and this mismatch on those titles is 10%. It isnt worse than having that i3 does to cpu-bound situations. Upgrading a bad platform is probabaly not his best price to dollar, but it is the nuanced situation he's in. if he can sell what he has for the price it goes for, going ryzen is always correct. However his cpu and all the others here are bad. If he can simply get a better part price on a single chip, he can get equivalent value from the upgrade compared to going ryzen.",Negative
Intel,You can get an i5 13600k with better performance than a 5800x. Also it is difficult to find the AM4 X3D CPUs these days so the intel route makes sense. He can later upgrade to a 14900k even which no AM4 CPU can match in terms of performance,Positive
Intel,"Weren’t you recommending upgrading to a 9400F?  Sure, the 9100F might be the limiting factor right now, but you’re still gonna hit the same PCIe bottleneck. It’s just gonna be more pronounced.",Neutral
Intel,"13th gen pricing is crap so I’ll use 14th gen for comparison, it’s basically the same  14600KF is $245 new and $180-200 used. It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.  Going Intel over AMD would cost at least $60 extra and most of the performance gains you would see using DDR5 on the 14600KF would be wiped out using DDR4",Negative

It helps a lot to understand that budget systems fall within their spec, it is only the highest-end and lowest-end options of this era that stretch the pcie issue... there are cycles of alarmist narritives in all media. That one is old news that likely shouldnt have been printed imo.",Neutral

Intel,Youre giving me nothing against the clear narritives youre following over substance of experience with this shitty level of cpu performance.,Negative
Intel,"Do you respect at all the starting position he is in or are u just an advice salesman? Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct. The only bad advice here wastes more time and money than his original choice of platform already sealed. Also ur just wrong about pcie bottlenecks im pretty sure",Neutral
Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0. That’s not opinion, that’s fact. That loss is going to be the same regardless of how good or bad your CPU is as long as the CPU isn’t the bottleneck.",Negative
Intel,I genuinely wonder what u get living in the idealized world where pcie 3.0 sucks ass below the highest-end 4.0 products and visa-versa.

Intel,"Yea. Your advice is fine and wasnt the target of my statements, I added the last comment as proof I agree a platform swap is a totally good option. He doesnt even need to change his cooler for a 9400f and can then get a normal gpu for a similar value to his current one. This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement.

I do have 2k and 4k texture mods installed and multiple other mods so maybe the fps i get may not be what you see on vanilla cyberpunk and even slightly higher for vanilla.   Yes you will still be cpu limited in cyberpunk for me 1440p no ray tracing or PT i get 70-100fps the 70fps is the extreme dips and this is with every setting maxed except for crowd density at low   I also pulled up intel present mon and took a look at cpu busy and gpu busy this tells me how quickly one is sending information to the other, generally you want the cpu busy and gpu busy to be the same so that one is sending and completing the instructions at the same time and speed.   So with my hardware/mods and settings my cpu busy was 8ms and gpu busy was 6.5ms so my gpu was definitely waiting on my cpu for a bit.   With pathtracing on i dropped down to about 50-60fps.   Keep in mind though this is with quite a few texture mods and them being either 2k or 4k and also this is with preset M.   I'm currently getting the i5 14600kf arriving in 1-2 days since i want better shader compilation times as well since dear lord it takes a while for some.  Arc raiders while i haven't played the game i'm pretty sure as like any other live service online fps game will be quite cpu intensive rather than gpu intensive based on their style of graphics and how it's done so you should be limited by the i5 12400 as well as for how much sorry i don't have any data for you.",Neutral

I am considering dropping to a 5070ti and a cpu upgrade instead.  As for arc raiders performance, on the max settings, it's still capping out my fps with dlss balanced at around 60 (although I'm using fsr 2x fg), as it has global illumination and stuff so I do think while there are moments I'm cpu limited there's also very intense graphical stuff, but if I upgraded gpu it would definitely be held back more by the cpu",Positive
Intel,Its the 3rd best GPU on the market with a 4 year old budget CPU. There is absolutely going to be a noticeable bottleneck in many games,Positive
Intel,"So yes, your board would support up to 14th gen Intel CPUs, and looks to have a high quality VRM, so shouldn't struggle at all with even the highest end CPUs.  I'd suggest grabbing the GPU and seeing how it performs in the games you play, and looking into upgrading the CPU if some aren't meeting your expectations.   The 14400 isn't much of an upgrade over the 12400, but you can currently get a a 14600kf for ~$220 US, which is a notable upgrade over both the 12400 and 12600.",Positive

Amazon have the MSI GAMING Trio 5070 Ti for £840 atm and some cheaper on their Used Like New option. You’d still be looking at like £400 more for a 15% - 20% performance increase.

Intel,"Thank you so much, after your comment I did come to think that upgrading down the intel line was still an option (I obv didn't do it before because of the issue, and in my mind currently I'd just ruled out cpu upgrades because of the whole ddr5 prices, and forget about 14th gen Intel)  I am in the UK so prices are a little more, but I could definitely go for like a 14600 or such. Is there much difference between the like 4600kf and like 14700? I will be upgrading my cpu so I should probably go for a higher than 850w if I plan to upgrade my cpu given I just saw the 14600kf is a 125w",Positive
Intel,"The ""f"" indicator on the CPUs means that it's a version with the internal graphics chip disabled, which is generally not a problem if you're going to have a dedicated GPU, and shouldn't effect performance.  The ""k"" indicator means that the CPU has a higher max power draw, and that it's unlocked for overclocking. To overclock, you also need a Z-series motherboard. The higher max power draw does mean that even with your B-series board, the ""k"" CPU will be able to run slightly faster than the ""non-k"" variant of the same CPU, usually translating to around ~5% more performance in real world scenarios.   The 14700k(f) is 0-10% faster at most vs the 14600k(f) in gaming workloads, depending on the game, so the 14700 non-k would be even less of a difference vs the 14600k(f). There's generally no reason to go for a non-k variant over the k variant if it's not cheaper, and the same goes for the f CPUs. In the UK, it looks like the 14600 non-k is not available anymore from major retailers, and the 14600kf is about £20 cheaper than the 14600k, so probably worth saving the money with the f model in your case.  I usually use this as a quick reference for power supply requirements with CPU + GPU combinations: https://www.msi.com/blog/recommended-psu-table  You can see that for an Intel i7 CPU with the RTX 5080, they indicate that an 850w PSU should be fine if you aren't looking to overclock, so as long as your PSU is a good quality 850w, I wouldn't worry about the power draw.   On the other hand, the 5080 uses Nvidia's new 12pin HPWR connector, which requires an (included) adapter to be used with older PSUs. This connector has a pretty bad reputation for pulling power unevenly and *melting* if the connections are not secure, so most people advise to use power supplies with native 12pin HPWR connectors if possible, to avoid extra points of failure. If you're careful (or if your PSU has these connectors natively - it's usually indicated on the box as ATX 3.0 or ATX 3.1), then it *shouldn't* be an issue, but these connectors are very finicky, so people are usually quite cautious about them.   The only other thing to note is that DDR4 does tend to effect the performance of these CPUs vs DDR5, which can range quite a bit depending on the game, with a few edge-cases actually running better on good quality DDR4 (games that prefer memory latency vs speed). This also effects 12th and 13th gen CPUs, so the performance differences between CPUs will still be the same in a relative sense, when both are using DDR4.",Neutral
Intel,"Thank you so, so sooo much <3 you are literally the best person ever, thank you  As for F, looking on the sites in the UK they generally seem to be around the same price as non F, so in that case I think I will grab a none F just in case of like, a gpu issue. Similar with K, the K are only marginally more expensive so I would definitely go with that over a none k.  As for 14700k vs 14600k, the 14700k is about £100 more than the 600, does that justify the price enough? The only other thing I can think of is for the 14600k the only version in stock for me is the F version (the others are all out of stock), so it's around £200 for 14600kf and like £320 for the 14700k.  Pins wise, yes I've done alot of very panicked research into the old vs new connectors, the melting and such. I was planning to upgrade my psu with the gpu (I currently have an 850w psu, I was going to get a corsair 850w at 3.1 for like £140) to get the at 3.1 ones with the native cable, and I was going to plug that thing in *very* firmly.  As for ram yeah I'm just using some corsair vengeance ram, but I can't remember the specific one/name. It's 2x8, and 3200mhz  Once again thank you so much",Positive
Intel,yeah thats fine,Positive
Intel,"I would probably pick a weaker CPU and stronger GPU, something like Ryzen 7600x / 7600 / 7500f and RTX 5060Ti 16GB or RX 9060xt 16GB.",Neutral
Intel,"Pretty much the only scenario that combo makes sense his high-fps gaming at 1080p. It will get probably 60-70fps for [AAA single player games](https://www.techspot.com/review/2935-intel-arc-b580/#Average_1080p) w/ high/ultra settings, but much worse with those that require [ray-tracing](https://www.techspot.com/review/2935-intel-arc-b580/#Ray_Tracing_Performance_Summary)  If you want to play both games like fortnite and Ghost of Tsushima I would recommend an AM4 setup like 5700X and RX 9060 XT 16gb.",Neutral
Intel,I found good deals on 7600X and RX 9060 XT 16GB. Thanks alot!,Positive
Intel,"Hm intereseting, I'll see benchmarks and if I can find good deals. I'll think about it but thx",Neutral
Intel,Tbh I don't mind 60fps at high settings. Thanks for explaning 👍Also for AAA games i could use XeSS and Frame Gen ngl,Positive
Intel,Happy to help!,Positive
Intel,"Just double checking, did you pull the plastic off the bottom of the CPU cooler?  Otherwise, you probably just need a beefier cooler, like a tower cooler",Neutral
Intel,"The 5600G is only a 65W CPU while the 5800XT is 105W and can pull as much as 120 or more watts, now ARC is a pretty CPU demanding game so depending on what CPU cooler you have, those temps could be normal. I would recommend a better dual tower 120MM cooler such as the Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 to keep temps under control.   During idle, what is your CPU temp?",Neutral
Intel,"Thermalright & Montech sell cheap AIO, maybe try one of those?",Neutral
Intel,The wraith prism is a great stock cooler and maxing at 91c isn't going to damage anything but even a 25 dollar tower cooler will out perform it. Id double check everything is tight and if it is then just grab a cheap thermalright.,Positive
Intel,"Buy a better CPU cooler, the stock cooler cannot reliably cool the 5800XT",Negative
Intel,I have a be quiet dark rock pro 4 and this CPU and it still hits 85C under load when overclocked. Pulls like 125w hitting all cores.   It’s just hot. Get a better cooler so it does not thermal throttle and use PBO to undervolt it a bit. You’ll be fine.,Negative
Intel,"This cpu runs hot. You can put it in eco mode in the BIOS which should limit TDP to like 65w. It'll run much cooler. I had similar issues with my 5800xt.   Or like others said, get a bigger cooler or get an AIO.",Positive
Intel,I have a 5800xt and I am far cooler than that at load.. or well over 80% and I am in a SFF using a small Fan..  A Thermalright AXP90-X53 to be exact. Pretty sure I have never seen 90 or even close to it. So basically you need a new cooler.,Neutral
Intel,"Definitely shouldn't be unless youre running a cheap wraith cooler. I ran a 5800x for 3 years on a cheap thermalright king se (single tower cooler with 5 heat pipes) and rarely seen anything over 70*. Later got a great deal on a 5800x3d and swapped to a thermalright peerless assassin (twin tower cooler) and never peak 65*.  Your fan setup, cpu cooler, case airflow, and fan curve are all going to play a major roll in this.",Neutral
Intel,"Mine needed pbo adjustments. It was pulling 142w at stock. I adjusted pbo and added a core curve, which lowered it.   Eventually I got a phantom spirit",Neutral
Intel,"I have a 5900x and it would hit 90 all the time, it’s considered normal. If you want your temp to be less turn off PBO in the bios and you’ll be fine.",Neutral
Intel,Those are hot running pieces of silicon. I have one of those cpu's as well and with the stock included air cooler high 80's Celsius temps are a common happening,Neutral
Intel,"Just get a peerless assassin or phantom spirit 120. Hell, even the ancient hyper 212 will cool better than the stock cooler. That's what I'm using now for my 5700x lol.",Positive
Intel,The stock cooler is probably not much good for that CPU. Your idle temps seem fine so don't think your installation was wrong. I'd probably just spend 30-40 bucks on a decent air cooler. Thermalright has plenty of options which perform well,Negative
Intel,"Mileage may vary, but I'm using a stealth on my 5800xt and my temps are fine.",Positive
Intel,"Could be that your cpu fan is bad. If not try to undervolt in bios. The stock fan isn’t ideal for this cpu, I have a 5800x and I was having the issue. Got the thermalright peerless assassin and the issue was fix.",Negative
Intel,You’ll need a better CPU cooler. A Thermalright Peerless Assassin will fix you right up without breaking the budget,Neutral
Intel,Did you buy it secondhand?,Neutral
Intel,The 5600g fan will never be strong enough and the 5800 doesn’t ship with a fan.,Negative
Intel,Get a Thermalright Peerless Assassin if it will fit in your case. They work extremely well and are cheap af,Positive
Intel,"I just got a 5800XT a couple of weeks ago. Mine didn't come with a cooler, and I thought of using my 3700X's Wraith Prism. However I bought an MSI Corefrozr AA13 for around $30, and it idles at \~43°C, lower than the 3700X, and hasn't exceeded 85°C even under 100% load. Needless to say, I'm very happy. I think the Wraith Prism does the job but is just not the best, there are many better options for cheap.   I had my doubts with this cooler as it has very few reviews and is not a double tower. Most of the commonly recommended coolers (looking at you Peerless Assassin) weren't available here, and other popular ones didn't have enough clearance for the big heat sinks in my RAM sticks. The Wraith Prism barely fit.",Neutral
Intel,"CPU fan that came with it you mean the wraith cooler? It's not enough for the thing, other than being loud AF. Replace it with the Usual Thermalright dual tower be it the Frost 120, PA, Spirit whatever.",Negative
Intel,"Very strange, I used to run overclocked to 160W with a meduum sized tower cooler at lower temperatures than that.  Try running with the side of your case taken off.  Is your room really hot?  Get a friend to check your cooler install",Neutral
Intel,The other option to try is to restrict the wattage to 80 or 65w in bios effectively a 5700xt to see if that is manageable and performance acceptable,Neutral
Intel,"AMD stock heat sinks are absolute garbage, that’s the problem… even my 5600x with the stock cooler IDLES at 60c.. goes up to 84+ in stress tests. By comparison my old ass Cooler Master 212 Black edition on it runs at a cool 40c idle and never hits 65c. Had to swap back to stock cooler to put the 212 on my old AMD system to get it back up and running for server duty and remembered why I couldn’t stand the stock cooler. I have a new one coming from Amazon now.",Negative
Intel,It's because the stock cooler sucks,Negative
Intel,"Dude, 91C is pretty rough for a Ryzen! 😬 That stock cooler just isn't cutting it, man. If you're looking to lower temps, you might want to consider picking up a solid aftermarket cooler. Don't ask me where, though—I don't kiss and tell! Anyway, that's my PSA. Hope you cool dow...",Negative
Intel,Your stock CPU cooler is not good enough to keep the  temperatures low at high loads!,Negative
Intel,"The AMD stock coolers also use a two clip system this is finnicky/tricky to install. There is a much greater chance to install it incorrectly compared to aftermarket coolers that use screws.   For reference, I have both stock coolers and aftermarket coolers for both Intel and AMD chips. The stock coolers keep the CPUs in the low 30s'C at idle. The Wraith Prism is worse than aftermarket coolers, but should be keeping his cpu in the 30s'C at idle.   The only time I ever had idle temperatures as high as the OP (almost 50'C) was when I was new-ish to building PCs and incorrectly installed an Intel stock cooler that had 4 push pin clips and I didn't push them in all the way.",Negative
Intel,I second the phantom spirit 120 or the assassin x plus (dual stack version for this cpu).  You can get them for cheap. I wouldn’t recommend this for OP but I have an assassin x 120 digital (has an argb software temp readout) and that is only $20 rn but I am going to use it for my 5600x which is only 90 watts I think,Positive
Intel,My 5800x3d barely peaks 60* after hours of arc raiders gameplay using a peerless assassin cooler and mx5 paste. I do have an absolute wind turbine of a case though (lian li lancool 216) but a relatively quiet/efficient custom fan curve.,Neutral
Intel,Currently I am idling around 44-47C,Neutral
Intel,Agreed 💯! I've had a Thermalright Frozen Notte 240mm AIO on my 12600kf for over 2 years so far...overclocked to 5.3/4.2/4.5 @ ~1.31v and it keeps it below 90c even during y cruncher stress test loop.  For ~$50 USD it's hard to beat!,Positive
Intel,I've had a Montech AIO for almost a year now and it's been great,Positive
Intel,"No, I am the sole owner.",Neutral
Intel,The 5800XT does ship with the Wraith Prism. The 5800X doesn't but the 5800XT does.,Neutral
Intel,"216 is such a beast, used that case for 4 of my friends builds i made for them in early 2024.",Positive
Intel,"Idle temps seem fine, so its probably not a mounting issue with the cooler, more then likely its not enough to cool down a 105W TDP CPU, I would recommend upgrading the cooler.  The stock Wraith Prism cooler is good but not enough for any CPU with a TDP or more then 65W especially in CPU demanding games such as Arc Raiders.",Neutral
Intel,Which CPU cooler are you using?,Neutral
Intel,"Your idle temperatures seem to be unusually high (unless your ambient temperatures/room temperature is very warm). What are your ambient temperatures? Have you tried reapplying fresh thermal paste and re-seating the cooler to make sure it is tightly strapped to the CPU?  The Wraith Prism is the best AMD stock cooler and should be able to handle the 5800XT just fine.  My Ryzen 3000s, 5000s, etc and my 88W-120W Intel chips with coolers better than, worse than, and equal to (literally the same HSF) the Wraith Prism all idle in the 20s-30s'C.  If everything ends up being fine and the cooler/heatsink is working as intended, then you can always just undervolt the 5800XT.",Neutral
Intel,Is the fans noisey when running that high?  I have a 240mm AIO from Corsair and the pump + fans are really noisey with stock settings if it get past 78c on a 12700k.  I'm thinking of just selling it and revert back to my previous dual tower air cooler.,Negative
Intel,"The Wraith Prism is the best of all the AM4/5 stock coolers (out of 4 of them) and should be able to handle 105w TDP CPUs just fine. It is the smaller Wraith Stealth and Spire that are for 65W cpus.  Wraith Stealth <<< Wraith Spire << Wraith Max < Wraith Prism.  The Wraith Prism came out with the 2700X, and that uses slightly more energy than the 5800X/XT (TPU shows \~175W for the 5800X and \~182W for the 2700X).  [https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-5800x/19.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-5800x/19.html)  His idle temps would be very high/unusually if his ambient temps are something like 70F/21C or lower. My Ryzen 3000, 5000, 5000X3D chips, etc 6 core and 8 core CPUs idled in the 30s'C (and even 20s'C when it was cooler), and my 88W 4790K increased to 120W was idling in the low 30s'C as well. This was with heatsinks better than, worse than, and equal to the Prism Wraith.",Positive
Intel,He says he used the boxed cooler. So a Wraith Prism.,Neutral
Intel,Just buy two Arctic P12 for $7 each and use those instead. I did that on my AIO and it dramatically improved both temps and noise.  Also you can probably run the pump at 70% without issues. Mine only ramps up to 100% at 80C.,Positive
Intel,"The fans max out at 2000 rpm, and wide open they're actually not that bad.  My PC is in my living room, and I can run Handbrake, Cinebench, etc and it doesn't interfere with watching TV or anything like that.  Of course there are quieter fans, and some people can tolerate noise better than others, but for the $$ spent, it's hard to beat.  I agree with the other reply, if you happen to get this AIO and the stock fans are too noisy for you, just swap them out with something from Arctic.  Also note, that the pump on the Frozen Notte is not PWM, so it runs at 100% at all times, but it's not noisy to me.",Neutral
Intel,"Also wanted to say that, if you want to customize your fan, download the program called FanControl and you should be able to lower the noise level.",Neutral
Intel,"My dual CCD 5800x (which runs about 5+C cooler than single CCD 5800x that have a fairly more warped IHS) wasn't kept in check by the wraith prism at all. Also the minimum RPM was like 1200 and it was loud as hell. While it's certainly the best stock cooler in recent production, it's completely useless against sub 50$ aftermarkets.",Negative
Intel,"I had money to spend so I got the new Corsair link and went ham on RGB. I spent some hours and had fun with different lights and themes.  It filled the itch and curiosity.  On spec, it seemed better than Arctic P12 (literally had P12 ARGB versions previously), but actual execution on cooling has been pretty disappointing. I had mines set to quiet, but course still hear pump noise.  If I ever do a next PC build, I prob go back to doing silent build again or a mini PC. Arctic P12 Pro is a much better design that addresses issues the original P12 had.  Though I am curious about Thermalright TL-12 performing better at lower RPM range than Arctic P12s.",Positive
Intel,"I have the Wraith Prism in one of my systems and I can barely hear the fan unless I really stress the CPU. I moved it into my HTPC to watch movies and play games and it is basically inaudible during quiet movie scenes.    It certainly would lose to any $50 aftermarkets. It would lose out to even a cheap $35-$40 Thermalright. However, it should still be perfectly sufficient to run a 105W cpu like a 2700X or 5800X.   The fact that his 5800X idles at 47'C suggests something is wrong with the cooler, TP, or the installation. A 5800X at idle consumes about the same power and gives off the same heat as the 5600X, 3600X, 5800X3D, 5700X3D, and 5700X. I've had almost every single one of these CPUs and my chips all ran in the high 20s 'C to low 30s 'C idle with ambient temps of around 21-25.5'C (70 to 78'F).",Negative
Intel,What issues did the original P12 have?,Neutral
Intel,"Or maybe it's the case (and it may explain the higher idle temp), there are a few revisions of the prism that had a lower RPM minimum threshold, mine was stuck at an obnoxiously high minimum RPM that made it loud and clear. In fact a few days later the Be Quiet DRP4 finally came and I got rid of the prism, but I'm quite picky with fan noise",Neutral
Intel,"I used P12 in various build for years. It's my go to.  The only problem is bearing noise after a year, even after cleaning.  My last build was strictly be quiet case fans mad had been quiet since then.",Neutral
Intel,Even after they switched to FDB? My P12s have been whisper quiet for a couple years now.,Negative
Intel,"I think your whisper quiet is my ""noisey"" lol.  When I had the P12 ARGB, that one is based on P12 Pro, did not exhibit noise.   Before my full $$$$ Corsair RGB build, I always had what I call ""dead silent"" builds. Like the computer would be 2nd or 3rd noisiest thing in the room even while gaming. Not the fast CPU and GPU, but can still have a high performance.  My haswell build 10 years ago had a large CPU heatsink no fan.  The original P12 has always had a balance issue when standing vertical position. If ran for 4 hours a day daily, after a year, I can hear the noise would increase and be a really faint bearing noise.  This is NOT an issue with P12 ARGB and P12 Pro as they have a revised fan design and I would totally recommend them over the original P12.   As for me thinking about Thermalright and Be Quiet, that is mainly to get the most amount of airflow with least amount of sound possible. I have seen YouTube videos of guys testing these at 800rpm and 1000rpm tests and Arctic is usually behind those fans (not a large margin, but still great on price per performance).",Neutral
Intel,Are you sure those issues persisted after they switched to FDB though? I know there was an annoying high pitched noise on their DBB fans.,Negative
Intel,"You can always get a 5070ti and increase the resolution. A better AM4 x3dCPU will be very hard to find for a proper price at the moment.   If you don't plan to play on 1440p, you're fine with your current setup.",Neutral
Intel,I have a 5600x and a 5070 and in 1440p it pairs very well. Im not 100% sure how well a 5600x would hold a 5070Ti but it should work good as well.  If you do upgrade to a 5070/5070Ti I would exclusively play in 1440p  The CPU usage in arc raiders is normal for our generation of CPU. Yes its bottlenecking but since your GPU is still high (80-95%) its not a hard bottleneck.   Also the difference from a 5600x to a 5800XT is like a 2% difference I would not waste money on a new CPU unless you can find a AM4 X3D for CHEAP.   Id do a 5070 and run it for a few years. Im very happy with how I perform in games.,Positive
Intel,I’ve been playing on 1440p most games except cs2 which I run on 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,I was actually meaning the ryzen 7 5800x3d. Seems like that would be around a 10% ish maybe more improvement over the 5600x. I like your suggestion. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,The 5070TI should be a good and meaningful upgrade for you at 1440p.,Positive
Intel,Also just realized the $200 sticker was for a 5800x not an x3d which is going upwards of $400-500 INSANE. Will probably save money and upgrade the gpu first.,Neutral
Intel,"i mean from what i know it think it’s good, honestly if you’re looking for those graphics i would say maybe a better gpu and possibly cpu, make sure to double check that you have access to ethernet to where you are in your home otherwise you’ll need a wifi motherboard. the ram might be an issue for some games and also you most likely won’t need that much storage, my 2tb (lol tb) storage fits me just fine with having multiple games in the hundreds like red dead. also if you’re upgrading see how much storage takes up with different games which can give you an estimate of how much or just count all the games haha. otherwise i think you’re fine",Positive
Intel,"Stay way from AsRock AM5 motherboards (they fry AMD CPUs). 7600X is a better CPU for a similar price. That GPU is not a good idea (expensive, old and low VRAM).

Intel,I have router on shelf right next to me that connected to laptop so internet wont be a problem (I still gonna buy the wifi adapter tho). Two of my feinds have 16GB of RAM and they play games that I listed above (and the others) more than fine. I will still of course upgrade my RAM in the future. I chose RX 6600 XT cuz I heard that it was good card with powers between 3060 and Ti. Def gonna upgrade it. And I chose 7500F because I think its a good start for a mid pc on AM5 probably gonna keep it for the longest  P.S Yeah I think im gonna buy smaller HDD but I want to start study video editing and modeling so I might still get 4TB.,Positive
Intel,the asrock motherboards are more or less fine now and it was mainly x3d chips that were the issue but they released bios updates and it should be fine now and they are great cheap motherboards with decent features,Positive
Intel,"Option 1 is definitely the way to go, you'll get so much better performance boost for your money.  While an X3D chip would be nice, they are in short supply and incredibly expensive for what you get.  Edit: You can also use DLSS on the 3070 to play games at 4K on the TV. It should look a lot better.",Positive
Intel,"For gaming purposes I think option A makes the most sense. The 5600x is a good cpu still, and you’ll see bigger performance upgrades all around this way. That’s in terms of FPS for games if what you want is maybe more performance for desktop applications then maybe go B or consider am5 for one of them.",Positive
Intel,Buy a 5070ti for your pc and put the 3070 inside yourgf's PC,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, CPU is fine on both. I’d look into the 9070 upgrade.",Positive
Intel,"Option 1. I don't think you should bring hunting down and overpaying for an X3D CPU. Staying with AM4 is about cost savings, not hunting a rare jewel and spending a fortune.",Neutral
Intel,"Rig 1 doesn't need an upgrade imo.  Rig 2 yeah the GPU maybe could size however I imagine you still okay fairly well on it anyway.  Option 1 makes the most sense of the two. You both get an upgrade with only needing one purchase.  That said, nowt wrong with a 3070 at all, specially for the use case.  Upgrade rig 2 to a 3070 if you can find one could be the cheaper option, but only one rig gets the upgrade.  So back to option 1 so you both get the upgrade feel.",Positive
Intel,"Option A and call it good. You'll have a hard time finding AM4 X3D, and by the time that you do, it'd be cheaper to go AM5 because scalpers gonna scalp. Also, going to a 3060 or 3060 Ti is a waste of money at this point. You'd be better off going to an RX 9060 XT 16GB instead of RTX 3060/3060 Ti.  Truthfully though, I'd look for a Ryzen 5 9600X and B650/B850 combo with RAM, and then go to a 9070 XT for your first. You can do a combo builder on Newegg and get CPU, mobo, and 32GB of RAM for $678 USD. Add an 850W PSU like an Montech Century II for 90 bucks, and you're laughing. At very least, it'll give your 3070 a bit more room to stretch its legs.  In saying that, Maybe sell off your other rig, and use it to offset the cost of a 9070 XT. Then, you can use your primary as your secondary. You can cheap out on a case for it and re-use your current one for the new stuff. Montech's X5/X5M are dirt cheap, look good, and give plenty of airflow. The included fans are SATA and non-PWM, but they're not noisy enough to be a pain, and they have a regular 5V ARGB header.  I just did a build in the X5M with a 9600X and 9060 XT 16GB, and the max temps with a Montech NX400 cooler(also dirt cheap) in that case under a 1-hour all-core stress test was 72°C. It's a definite recommend to save money on any build without sacrificing airflow...and it has USB-C on the front I/O",Neutral
Intel,Do you live near a microcenter?,Neutral
Intel,"Upgrade 1 will give you more fps because of the faster gpu, and with a gain of 10-15% from a 5800x to x3d with a 5090 at 1080p low, (hardware unboxed video yesterday) I´d rather opt for a search for a used cheap 5800x to add some clocks and  2 cores to your main system  Upgrade 2 will do nothing for the first system and you get a new gpu for the second one.",Positive
Intel,"Exactly this.  At 1440p and especially at 4k, it is the GPU that is doing most of the heavy lifting.  BUT, I always recommend that you use Adrenaline or some other hardware monitor to see what the utilization of both the CPU and GPU is during game play where you think you could benefit most from better performance.  That will tell you what component is maxing out and should be upgraded first.",Neutral
Intel,"Or...sell off Rig 1 and do the AM5/9070 XT build and keep Rig 2 and upgrade the GPU later. The reason that I say go AM5 9600X, is because it performs close to AM4 X3D chips in most games...sometimes better.",Neutral
Intel,unfortunately i am no where near an MC,Negative
Intel,Appreciate your thoughtful input. I wasn’t aware of the  closeness in performance of AM5 9600x vs  AM4 x3d. I’ll do some more research on that front.  For now I’m leaning towards getting just a 5070ti now and waiting another year or so to upgrade rig 1 to AM5.,Neutral
Intel,Boo ok was going to say it would be cheaper to buy a mobo combo than upgrade to an x3d on AM4 those are getting pretty expensive used.,Neutral
Intel,"Hardware Unboxed did a 5800X3d/5700X3D revisit the other day, most of the time, it was within 5-7% of them in games.",Neutral
Intel,"considering rampocalypsis  if u can get an 5700x3d or 5800x3d (dont know if ali express still are), and maybe a 9060xt or 5060 (16gb both of them) u can get a nice upgrade that will last a few more years, at least untill the rampocalypsis finish and u can do a proper upgrade ( if u wanted a more powerfull GPU i would suggest buying a new PSU)  and even with the rampocalypsis, maybe u are interested in a new pair of 8Gb ram stiscks ddr4 and bump the ram up to 32Gb",Positive
Intel,"Sell your old PC. Then buy a new one if you get a reasonable price, especially for RAM that can easily take most of your budget for DDR5 32 gb.",Neutral
Intel,your cpu can push a much better gpu to its limit in 1440p gaming...  just get a 9060xt 16gb gpu and wait for ddr5 prices to come back to earth...,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly I've spent about 448 euro to upgrade my girlfriends 2600x and GTX1660 super to a 5800x and RTX 5060, night and day difference and she can pretty much play anything modern again at 60-144fps depending on the game with decent settings.  I'd get a decent 750 watt PSU with a 5070Ti and you'll still have money left for a 5800x3D if you can find one. That alone sounds like a better long term deal than settling for a 5070 instead.  Sidenote: why is your post written with AI?",Positive
Intel,I'd upgrade it alltogether. In my opinion if you want to upgrade cooling/storage it's fine but if you get into gpu/cpu territory it's not that worth it because upgrading a cpu is limited to what your mobo is compatible with. Besides when you want significantly more performance you'd upgrade the mobo with cpu then you think you want a better gpu and you will end up with an entirely new pc at the end but you will blueball yourself with performance along the way so it's best to build/buy a new one once and have it behind you.,Neutral
Intel,"for upgrade gpu lead to need more cpu power too, should consider cpu in am4 system that can match with 5070ti",Neutral
Intel,I'd rather buy or build a new pc.,Neutral
Intel,"lets say u upgraded ur current, if u can find a reasonable price or find it at all the 5700x3d/5800x3d, then thermalrights peerless assassin 120se/phantom spirit 120se, plus montech century II 850w, plus the rx 9070 xt, u should have around 400-500€ left and the pc would be better than the 5070 prebuilt,",Neutral
Intel,"I've previously upgraded the GPU (970 to 4070) in an older system (5820K from 2014) and was happy with the improvement. I wanted to buy a GPU whilst they were easily available, and affordable to me, so I ordered a 4070 FE on release day in April 2023, to pair with a new 4K VRR-capable monitor. My intent was always to take it with me to my next system, which I eventually did in November 2025.  Whilst I probably didn't get every ounce of performance out of it whilst it was in that 5820K system, it was still a massive improvement, and necessary for making good use of the 4K monitor.  I should note, however, that my old system already had a capable 850W PSU. If I'd had to upgrade the PSU, I likely would not have bothered, as I find recabling a labour-intensive job that I'd rather not do.  In your place, I think your 450W PSU restricts you, unless you feel very differently to me about upgrading it. I wouldn't upgrade the GPU to anything needing much more than the 1070Ti's 180W, which would limit you to a 5060Ti or 9060XT which should both offer about a 2x improvement. You may feel that you'd rather pay a bit more and get a far more capable GPU, with a bit more headroom, however.",Positive
Intel,Prebuilt PC specs? If it's on am5 with 32gb of RAM that's likely the best choice.  What resolution and refresh rate is your monitor?,Positive
Intel,Absolutely getting the prebuilt. Sell the old if you want to recoup some of the cost.  You can move the old HDD into the prebuilt if it doesn't come with one (as I assume it doesn't),Neutral
Intel,"""I’ve always upgraded my old PC piece by piece"" This is always a bad idea and it just means you didn't build a well balanced PC, but rather that some components were big overkill, so you had headroom to upgrade other components that were the wrong choice initially.   Always save money until you can buy entire new PC, and build it so well with components of similar relative power so that any upgrade would make no sense. That's how you make the most for your money, get the most performance and it also eases up selling/gifting old PC as a bonus.  So always the answer is buy entire PC (either pre-built which is nowadays a decent option, or all components needed separately and build it yourself), now whether you can find satisfactory PC for your budget is something only you know, but worst case scenario just save up more money if you need better PC - but always buy at once everything.",Negative
Intel,AliExpress still has some for the small price of 500-600 € for the 5800X3D 😭,Neutral
Intel,"This would be my first low risk avenue as well. But keep in mind I've got other things to spend my money on, so I'm always looking for dollar efficiency.   That GPU is the weak point.  If you find new have are having trouble in two or three years you can always do a full upgrade.",Neutral

Intel,There's nothing wrong with budgeting and upgrading separately as you go lol,Neutral
Intel,if you can afford it get a 9070 or 9070 XT... my 9600x and 9070xt combo can run Arena Breakout Infinite at max setting into the over 100's of fps with no fake frames or upscaling..,Neutral
Intel,"English isn't my native language either. Just write it down in broken English if you have to, you'll learn more and nobody should shame you for it. AI can be a great tool, but don't let it get in your way of learning a new language.",Neutral
Intel,"What is ""budgeting"" in this context? And yes, there is something wrong with upgrading as you go, and I explained why. It means PC was not built to be balanced, relative power of components didn't match eachother, you had big bottlenecks as long as there is headroom for meaningful upgrade (meaning you never saw the full potential of your CPU because GPU was too bad for it, if you have the headroom to upgrade just GPU).  If you have the ability to meaningfully upgrade some component - it means you picked the wrong components in the 1st place, and wasted money on those overkills for no reason, since you were limited by worse components so you could never enjoy them. By the time you get to upgrade one or two components - you'd be better off if you saved money for entirely new PC cos now you can get for the same cost newer components that you picked as overkill. You get the idea.  Upgrading ""as you go"" is wrong, sorry. It means your PC was not well built and that you either overspent for some components (if they are overkill and leave headroom for other components to be upgraded) - or underspent for those weaker ones.",Negative
Intel,"You're delusional, bottlenecks aren't a thing out of the extremes and purely dependent on what you do with the system.  The 'headroom for upgrade' comes from hardware manufacturers, not your system being 'unbalanced'.  You are objectively wrong, and I'm going to tell you why in the case of upgrading CPU + GPU:  * End cost is \*the same\* * You get increased performance while waiting to afford the other part * More time spent with higher performance  The only counterpoint from here is you providing evidence that running an ""unoptimal"" system is harmful to the hardware.  edit: Fantastic argument, I thoroughly enjoyed our conversation :-)  edit2: Blocking actually isn't a great look although it can personally save you some dignity when things get uncomfortable. Not what I would have expected so quickly from a person so willing to get into a discussion about a given topic.  Anyway, to answer your questions and claims!  >\- Why do you insult?

I wouldn't say calling someone ""delusional"" for providing ignorant statements would be considered an insult  >If you've waited for the next gen(s) to buy entire new PC, you can either buy one category below of similar performance for less money, or the same category for same money would result in even better component cos it's newer. Argument dismissed.  Obviously, performance gets cheaper as time goes on, I don't really know what this is supposed to mean. You can absolutely go from a Ryzen 5 3600x - RTX 2070 build to an RTX 5070 and buy a 5600x a month later for an example.  >7600X vs 9800X3D, with RTX 3060 GPU both will be **the same** \- no increased performance. Money wasted. Argument dismissed.  Correct! I don't think I made any statement to the contrary, that falls under my ""out of the extremes"" and ""dependent on use-case"" comments I made! :)  That would result in no performance increases in gaming.  As a reminder, the poster is planning to upgrade his GPU and he will see massive increases across the board compared to his 1070 Ti. Can you provide evidence to support that switching from the 1070 Ti to a 5070 Ti would result in lower fps, freezes and stutters?",Negative
Intel,"""You're delusional, bottlenecks aren't a thing out of the extremes and purely dependent on what you do with the system.""   \- Why do you insult?

Argument dismissed.  ""You get increased performance while waiting to afford the other part""    Lie. Since you are bottlenecked by the worst part, and unless it's a GPU it's an ugly bottleneck too, not just resulting in reduced FPS, but if it's CPU one it could be stutters/freezes too.

Intel,"If you are upgrading CPU (presumably to a 5000 series?) then B580 is probably the best option, but you need to make sure that your motherboard supports Resizable Bar otherwise performance will be bad.  Otherwise I'd probably take the 5050.",Neutral
Intel,At those prices arc b580 is the only thing that really makes sense. Any more options for used cards like a 7600/ 6600xt etc?,Neutral
Intel,"Get the Intel B580 12GB, it's drivers are more stable now as compared to before. Nowadays you don't want an 8GB GPU. Bad idea in 2026.",Negative
Intel,"Have had my B580 since mid-Dec 2024, and have had no issues because of the games played, and it is also paired with a Ryzen 5 5600. Aside from the RX 6600, what are other AMD options available to you that maybe at the 400$ mark since that is your budget for the 5050...?",Positive
Intel,Get some RTX 3080 10/12 gb and don't fuck my brain.,Negative
Intel,Might be a dumb question but what is a resizable bar? and also how do i check if my motherboard has it,Neutral
Intel,i dont really want to get used cards but i found used 7600 for 230$ (8gb) and used 6600 for 250$,Negative
Intel,good to hear,Positive
Intel,the AMD 500 series gpus has their support ended and the other decent ones are above my budget if i get a new one and i dont wanna buy used ones,Negative
Intel,shit is 650$ in my country way out of my budget,Negative
Intel,"It's a setting in your motherboard BIOS. [Here is Intel's support article](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html) about it. It is basically required to get the expected performance from Intel GPUs, but having it available as an option was something introduced around 2019, not all older motherboards have it.  Your board might also not have it right now, but if you update the BIOS (which you need to do for a new CPU anyway) that might add support for it.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah neither of those is really worth it over the 580 imo unless your board doesn't support rebar as other commenters have pointed out. If that ends up being the case i really think the 7600 used might be the best option.,Negative
Intel,So nothing newer than the RX 6600?  And what is your mobo and PSU?,Neutral
Intel,GIGABYTE GA-A320M-S2H motherboard and 500w psu,Neutral
Intel,"There are multiple revs of that mobo model. If resizeable bar (or whatever Gigabyte calls it) is currently not available in your BIOS version, you may need to incrementally update BIOS (and you may need to do it all the way to the most recent). Check after each update; the Gigabyte site is showing that incremental updates are necessary...read the notes.  500W PSU will limit your GPU options. What is/are the PCIe connector(s) available from that PSU?",Neutral
Intel,"I replied a bit late but i just updated my BIOS to the latest version, i will check if theres a resizeable bar in my motherboard. My PICe connector is 2 + 6 connector i think",Neutral
Intel,"If rebar exists, then you have 50 watts to spare and the connector for the ARC B580 aside from the overhead that may be there with the 1600...",Neutral
Intel,so should i go for it? even if i dont have rebar (i still didnt check it its 1 am) i will upgrade my cpu in a month,Neutral
Intel,ok i just checked it and it does have rebar,Neutral
Intel,Then the overhead issue with the Ryzen 5 1600 is the remaining concern...and that may be game dependent.,Neutral
Intel,DDU ?,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't be getting worse performance at all. Did you run DDU to uninstall your old Nvidia drivers? Often switching from Nvidia to AMD and vice versa can cause issues like this.,Negative
Intel,most shooter games rely on cpu and your running a 2018 cpu with a 2025 gpu not really a big problem just prob being bottlenecked you also may be running arc raiders with nvidia settings while using a amd card,Neutral
Intel,"You're cpu bottlenecked. You can increase graphics settings. This won't increase your fps, but it might improve stutters and it will give you free graphics improvements.",Neutral
Intel,Is the GPU at 100% utilization?  Are you vram limited?,Neutral
Intel,"yes, nothing change after DDU or Windows Reinstall",Neutral
Intel,"i already trying this too, same FPS on LOW and EPIC",Positive
Intel,"You can also set a fps cap, lower it a bit until you no longer see stutters.",Neutral
Intel,fps cap can't help because FPS are going to 45 to 70 to fast,Negative
Intel,Then you just need to set it low enough. Otherwise you'll keep facing stutters.,Neutral
Intel,you must have some huge hands judging from the apparent size of that box,Neutral

Intel,Get the B580 in my opinion,Neutral
Intel,Had the a770 LE loved it! Wasn’t very powerful considering the specs but it was nice to see Intel actually putting effort in the Gpu space. I would personally go with the B580,Positive
Intel,Yup. Also does media processing very very good.,Positive
Intel,"CPUs don't support resizable BAR, devices do. Arc cards don't require resizable BAR it's just expected to be used.",Negative
Intel,"Rebar isn't needed for Arc gpus to function, but it is needed for them to function as intended. I believe Arc does need a motherboard with a UEFI bios, but could be wrong on that.",Neutral
Intel,You can look up compatibility on the PC builder site.   I got a Z790 for 125$   I got the I5-14600Kf for 150$   It holds up really nice.  BE REALLY CAREFUL the Intel GPUs need REBAR so keep your eyes peeled for that.,Positive

Intel,intel 13th and 14th gen have cpu failures so only buy if you are willing to risk that,Negative
Intel,Totally forgot about the rebar. Thanks for the reminder. My current cpu and mobo support rebar and I have it activated. Definitely something I’ll have to consider when I upgrade to ddr5,Positive
Intel,Would 12600kf for 100 be good?,Neutral
Intel,A few thousand miles? Sorry that sucks. Their bundles/combos on parts are better than sex sometimes.,Negative
Intel,I mean.. CPUs are pretty far ahead of GPUs at least in terms of gaming.   Unless you planned on running 1440 with everything on ultra the B580 is great on most games. You’ll never feel like you are forced to run a game on low graphics.,Positive
Intel,If you plan on investing in Intel GPUs I would press you to get the newest gen.   Intel ARC B580 which is an entry Intel GPU didn’t play nice with older Intel Chips   12600 would hold up just fine.,Positive
Intel,Thanks there’s also the brand new core ultra 5 225f with bf6 for 150 on amazon. Would ultra core be a better fit?,Positive
Intel,If you don’t plan on upgrading it’s fine but if Intel releases a newer card that more powerful it might get bottlenecked.,Neutral
Intel,Dang maybe am5 cpu is better,Positive
Intel,I’d say to go AMD.   Intel royally fucked up in that race but since they did have a major price drop because of it I scooped one up cheap.,Negative
Intel,"I'd upgrade the gpu. Maybe look for 3080 / 6800xt. Should give you a nice fps bump without being choked out too bad. The 7700k is as good as you can go on that motherboards, so if you want a cpu upgrade on the cheap I'd look for an am4 motherboard with a 3600x(cheap) or 5600x then you can keep the ram.",Positive
Intel,Budget/country?,Neutral
Intel,I plan on replacing the mobo. I play Tarkov some and people have raved about the 7800x3d and thought of moving to AMD. I also looked at a 3080 but some of the 5060 I’ve seen are close enough to warrant “future proofing” with a newer gpu.,Neutral
Intel,"U.S., don’t have a set budget overall. I would say $4-500 for a gpu that does what I need it to do. I can wait on ram to come back down to earth if that helps.",Neutral
Intel,"I know this may sound a weird, but I would wait six months before doing any additional work to your system.  It looks fine, great even, and hopefully it’s meeting your needs… but it’s worth using it for a few months to help better determine what works, what doesn’t, what you’d like to change, etc.  There’s always a weird period for me after a build where it’s like… “great, now what?”, “what project should I do next?”.  You may be experiencing this.",Positive
Intel,"tyvm for this reply! At this point im not thinking on ""upgrading"" any further. But i do feel that im missing out ""quality"" wise, when it come to the ingame quality.  Let me use ArcRaiders as an example, first time ever running a recent tittle in EPIC quality. but still feels grainy, but im realy not sure if its related to the monitor, (can provide model when i get home), it's connected with DP.  Right now im very much pleased obviously, and hearing that it looks fine, probably the only thing i might be buying is indeed a monitor cuz currently im just using one. and for what i hear you dont buy a second monitor, you buy a better new one and use the current as the 2nd.",Neutral
Intel,"You’d need twice the ram, a way newer cpu for 200fps in anything modern, sure cs, valo and Fortnite will run 400fps on a 7500f or 14600k cpu which cost 130$/190$ respectively with the first being upgradable and the second one being able to use ddr4. But anyways you’d 100% need a new mobo. For 1080p you’d also want at least 12gb of vram for future titles but some shit show games like borderlands 4 or escape from tarkov are just so unoptimized your lucky to get 90fps in those. Normal games like cyberpunk with normal settings or the new battlefield will give you around 150-200fps but it’s tricky in the newer engines to consistently hit high fps with very realistic graphics.   So TLDR: you need to change everything anyways. Currently building is bad due to ram shortages and GPUs went up last week all 50-100$ already due to vram shortages. So get yourself a decent prebuilt. 7800x3d if doable and 5070 or 9070 should be great and doable around 1800$",Neutral

Intel,"Great answer, thank you.  Worth it to even try to sell my current rig on marketplace or just keep it as a second setup?",Positive
Intel,"It’s still decently worth something 250$ if it looks good should be fair and gone quite quickly. Maybe a bit more if you have time. If that enables a better purchase I’d be extremely inclined to do it since prices now are high but the prebuilt options I mentioned or the one you said are very capable so you don’t „need“ to get something even better, it’s more of a „if you want it it’s not gonna hurt“ as you can keep the pc longer",Positive
Intel,It'll eat those games for breakfast.,Neutral
Intel,That'll do it. Is that a prebuilt? What's the pricing like?,Neutral
Intel,Sweet thank you! I bought a pc yeeeears ago that had a great price but I didn’t look into the specs like an idiot. I can barely play lethal company on it right now 😂,Negative
Intel,Ya it’s a prebuilt for $2300 (before tax),Neutral
Intel,Appreciate it! I’ll remember that!,Positive
Intel,You could likely build an equivalent PC for cheaper. Like $400 cheaper.,Neutral

Intel,lol old skool,Neutral
Intel,"Personally I think the fps jump is worth it, I prefer higher fps over better looking games, the rtx 2060 will make the games look way better for sure, but you will feel a jump in responsiveness from 144 fps, specially based on the fact that you play cs and Fortnite, since shooters are games that feel the best with high refresh rate.",Positive
Intel,how much does a gpu cost for you? I think 144hz IPS monitor would be much cheaper,Neutral
Intel,Fps doesn't matter if your monitor doesn't show it.  Have your dad buy the more expensive one and you save money for the cheaper one.,Neutral
Intel,Monitor would be better value,Neutral
Intel,"i think the monitor would be smth like 400PLN (94EUR/$110) and the GPU i could be looking for would be 600-700PLN, but that doesnt matter that much, im just thinking what would be better value, an old gpu with 144hz, which would be useful only in some esport games (bc its too weak to play SP on good settings on >60 frames) or a new gpu with a old 60hz monitor so the extra frames wouldnt change anything",Neutral
Intel,"i told him to buy a monitor cuz its gonna be at least few months till i could buy a gpu, so i could use higher refresh rate meanwhile and the price difference wasnt that bad (600pln for the gpu arc a750 and 400 for 144hz ips monitor)",Neutral
Intel,"yea, i think im gonna buy that for now",Neutral
Intel,"I see that you are from Poland, you can find good deals on monitors here: https://www.pepper.pl/grupa/monitory   And other things like GPU or anything really, Pepper is a neat site, kind of like reddit but you upvote or downvote deals other users find.",Positive
Intel,"I think monitor would be better, if you already hit 60 fps in SP games you would get no smoothness improvement from a new gpu     gpu should be your next upgrade though",Neutral
Intel,"yea, i was thinking just like you, so im gonna buy a monitor for now (some budget Philips E-Line 24E2N1110/00 for 279pln) and look for some intel arc a750 in the near future, you think its a good idea or i should look for smth else?",Neutral
Intel,"Not sure about budget monitor market tbh, might wanna make a separate post on this (or other) sub, idk if its allowed to ask about this here  include your country btw when asking for recommendations  just look for 144hz ips 27'' or 24'', chinese is fine",Neutral
Intel,Maybe the psu is a little light for the system? If the gpu can draw 225w and 65w for the cpu. That’s already around 300w. With fans and MB added to the wattage it could be too much for the power supply to provide.,Neutral
Intel,Are your graphic drivers up to date?  If so the next thing I would check is your power draw.,Neutral
Intel,change your hdd or ssd,Neutral
Intel,"I set it up so the GPU draws 180w from the PSU, and the PSU is probably not the problem because the game ran smoothly at 100+ FPS on the Legacy version",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah they are, i did a clean install this time wich means every old driver i didnt delete got deleted, still didnt fix it, i think the PSU isnt the problem because GTA online on the legacy version ran at 100+ FPS in high settings",Negative
Intel,No,Neutral
Intel,Why not buy a cheaper gpu?,Neutral
Intel,How would that make anything better ?,Negative
Intel,You’re not allowing the GPU to run at its full engineered potential (waste of money/starving the GPU of power it needs to run enhanced version). Then complain about graphical issues and studders while using an underpowered PSU. That’s the problem.,Negative
Intel,"Ik my psu is bad i just dont have the money for it, i was looking for temporary fixes",Negative
Intel,When you get a stronger PSU change ALL power supply cables too.  Even the same brand of PSU can be pinned differently and it can potentially fry part/all of your system. At least legacy works good so that’s better than nothing. 😋,Neutral
Intel,start with a memtest.  Install it to a USB drive and boot from it.  Run the test and it will make sure your memory is working properly.  If it is then it's onto the next piece of troubleshooting which would be the PSU imo.,Neutral
Intel,It’ll be a Tuesday event when I dig into it. Add me if you’d like so I can shoot you a message with what I find,Neutral
Intel,I’m leaning towards PSU. I’m not sure what he currently has in there but he also gave me 1200w ROG Thor PSU and said he bought it off marketplace but it didn’t work. Wondering if he has an undersized unit in there. I’ll ask and report back 🫡,Neutral
Intel,You can see that easily for yourself.  Just take off the side panel and look at the sticker on the unit.  Post a picture here if you're not sure what you're looking at.,Neutral
Intel,Good way to test the psu is to do a stresstest on the cpu and gpu (with something like furmark & aida64) and see if it also crashes or if it only crashes with arc raiders.,Neutral
Intel,mmmm if your Dell doesnt support Resizeable BAR I wouldn't bother with Intel ARC. It's a requirement to get useable performance out of them.,Negative
Intel,"Yeah that was the original intent before it got fried. Pulled the cmos out to see if I can reset the bios and get it moving. Otherwise I’ll try those methods, thanks!",Neutral
Intel,"It’s got resizable bar support, but apparently I did something wrong along the way because this thing boots straight to that by the time my monitor is up and running",Negative
Intel,Which model is it?,Neutral
Intel,"5680, cpu should support it as should the bios if my prior research came up right.",Neutral
Intel,I really dont think a PC from 2018 supports Rebar. I could be wrong though.  Maybe you could try booting with the integrated GPU and go from there.,Negative
Intel,"I tried that option, but the only integrated option was a display port. Wouldn’t have thought that’d be an issue, but my monitor hits me with a “display disabled, reset computer” screen",Negative
Intel,"Update, unplugged the arc and went for the display port. It’s not as fucked but still hardly booting",Negative
Intel,"Just a FYI resizable base address register has been a thing since PCIe 3.0 was released in 2010.  The real question is if the BIOS has the settings or not.  RebarUEFI can add support for pretty much any UEFI based system but it isn't easy to get working properly. Back when I was looking into using RebarUEFI for an el cheepo system I discovered that AMD's ""Smart access memory"" is based on REBAR but with improvements.",Neutral
Intel,My z370+8600k supports reBAR no problem,Positive
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral

Intel,Idgaf when Strix Halo products are nowhere to be seen (notebooks),Negative
Intel,"Except that the B390 will be far more common as it will be seen in far more laptops. Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive

Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,Panther Lake is using a superior process technology. So they are right. But it doesn't matter as customer will choose what's better. But until AMD has something out that uses 2nm then yes they will be behind probably,Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel stays competitive and AMD also brings its best to the table.,Positive
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral
Intel,amd unfazed? I bet they are talking big shit again then will get absolutely demolished (as it happened with vega too),Negative
Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Positive
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Neutral
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Positive
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral
Intel,"So AMD having much faster iGPUs for decade or more did not do much.  But now Intel rolling out something at unknown price/power package will absolutely decimate AMD.  Regardless of what will happen, ""AMD's fault"" indeed. (amazing silicon designers and experts at everything posting for free on reddit have convinced me)",Negative
Intel,"Laptops haven't really been AMD's focus, and apart from Zen1, AMD's focus has been mostly on data center, with desktop being the natural offshoot.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah they ain't immune to being complacent.  And bad press doesn't make Intel stay bad.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, their leaders aside from Ms. Su are all holdovers from AMD almost bankrupt times. Software sucks, graphics sucks, and now they are taking CPU down the drain too with high prices. Shitty leaders, lead to shitty outcomes.   They post high useless benchmark numbers no one cares about. They cannot compete with Apple in terms of battery life, and get creamed at low power levels.",Negative
Intel,"News at 10: ""Companies prioritise profits""",Neutral
Intel,"so either AMD doesn't have the capacity to produce them, or OEMs aren't interested, neither option is a compelling reason for AMD to focus on mobile",Negative
Intel,"We’d wish they were, but they’re not. Intel was struggling on all fronts due to their fabs. Amd is actually moving super fast in data centre so both epyc and instinct which is where they believe their money will be. They just don’t care to do anything in the consumer market.",Negative

Intel,"Yes, Strix Halo",Neutral
Intel,And having fsr4 supported in mobile at all,Neutral
Intel,FSR 4+ may be great but game support (number of titles + GPUs supported) is embarrassingly low,Negative
Intel,Dlss 4.5 not that great in my opinion. It fixes some ghosting but creates more shimmering because it has so much sharpening. I had to dial back to 4.0.,Negative
Intel,wildcat lake.  only issue it seems to be using 2 P cores and 4 LPE cores instead of E + LPE,Neutral
Intel,70% faster being “barely eke out a win”? Go ask why amd is stuck with 18 month old architecture despite intel managing to replace arrow lake after 12?,Negative
Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.   Being power efficient opens up a lot of form factors to be able to game with such as thin and light laptops, tablets, or gaming handhelds",Neutral
Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.   That's why it's silly to be a ""fan"" or ""supporter"" of one company or the other.  They don't care about you, they care about making money and when they have a dominant position they will exploit it.  > At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.  Realistically speaking, it's easy to make the case that on a 7""-9"" screen the 40 CUs is way overkill.  There's still room for a middle ground that Intel could easily fill.",Negative
Intel,"Absolutely consumers win when competition is hot, AMD has a bit too much of a lead ATM so they are cashing in and getting lazy. That said I am glad they are having their day, only because a few years ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and I really want to see them on a fairly level playing field with Intel... If we end up with 2 juggernauts training blows, having big resesrch budgets, etc we'll get lots of innovation and competitive pricing.",Neutral
Intel,"You had to shovel $1k for a 8 core CPU for about a decade, before AMD came.  So ""it just hiked the price"" is BS.  AMD cannot keep prices low while TSMC, effective monopolist, keeps posting record profits quarter after quarter.",Negative

Intel,AMD has always been like this. The OG Athlon FX line from ~22 years ago were $1000 CPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Wasn't it equivalent more or less to the 4050m as it was power limited to 30 watts?,Neutral
Intel,"It's the price of the final product that will matter.  And given that Intel has lion's share of the mobile market, I don't see why the would not ask outrageous $$$ for it.  It is ""impressive"" only in the ""for iGPU"" context.   Based on the benches shown, laptops were consuming around 60W.  While AMD""s 370 HX has been shown to be able to game at below 20W, so uh.  Let's bait for wenchmarks in any case.",Neutral
Intel,"Sure, sure.  I'm going to wait for proper benchmarks done under lab conditions and documented by more than ""Intel let me run this game with the FPS counter on.""

Intel,This. Plus even lunar lake outperformed Strix Point in many scenarios already. Intel is at least one generation ahead here,Positive
Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

So performance wise panther lake should be about on par with a full powered 3050Ti laptop.  That plus more advanced ray-tracing cores, it's running doom dark ages really well, AMD is still stuck at RDNA 3.5 and ray-traced games suck on the 890M.

Intel,Lunar lake came out after strix point. It was squarely a competitor to the 890m. Amd just officially released the cut down strix point as Z2E later.,Neutral
Intel,"No, not really. Making up a ""winner"" is stupid and nothing but fanboy behavior.  A faster dGPU is generally better because you’re generally not power limited on a desktop. It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

They use the 64b channel convention as it is a customer facing spec, that doesn't meant they actually have that many channels in hardware.   The Pantherlake datasheet isn't public yet, but you can see plainly in the [actual spec sheet](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/memory-controller-mc/) for Arrowlake H that it supports 8 channels of LPDDR5X (additional [spec](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/supported-memory-modules-and-devices/) for channel width).

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

Panther Lake's cpu is built on the most advanced silicon process node 18A, designed to compete against TSMC's N2 (2nm) which is set to release in products in the second half of 2026. Panther Lake's gpu is built on TSMC N3E, a significantly more efficient N3. The 4050 is built on a custom 2020 TSMC 5nm variant, and Arrow Lake is built on TSMC N3+6nm. Arrow Lake is designed for specifically for high power use vs the low Lunar Lake and Panther Lake.   The future of integrated graphics is truly bright. I can see it being exactly where it is now.

I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Intel,"HELP - GPU not detected after Ubuntu boot repair and CSM toggle  SYSTEM SPECS CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 9600X GPU: AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Mobo: AsRock B650M PG Riptide Main Storage: Crucial T500 M.2 NVMe (Windows 11) Secondary Storage: ADATA SATA SSD (Old Ubuntu install)  THE ISSUE My PC was working fine until I tried booting into an old Ubuntu installation on my secondary ADATA SATA SSD. Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I don't use a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but the maximum operating temperature (Tjmax) for the 7800X3D is 89°C. If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.

Even with a 144hz display. I'd be happy locked at 60 even.",Negative
Intel,Ok I thought I was the only one having the enhanced sync issue because no one replied to any of my posts about it. I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync. I don't use noise suppression so I don't know what's up with that.,Negative

Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.

That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,"performance wise it should only be a couple frames of latency, when doing rendering on dgpu and going out through igpu it'll just copy over the frame buffers.   Main impact is on pcie bandwidth as it'll use up quite a lot there, and to a smaller degree RAM load, so you definitely don't want to run some other dynamic load on the igpu when gaming to overwhelm its pcie link.

Intel,"I had to go back to version 25.9.2 but I no longer have AMD Adrenalin. If I try to install it, it reinstalls version 25.11, which crashes my game. Is it necessary to have AMD Adrenalin? I have a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.",Negative
Intel,Could you try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter? I wonder if it works in this situation =D,Neutral
Intel,I have the same issue with display port but it’s okay with hdmi :/,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative

Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Positive
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive

Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Negative
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Neutral
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral
Intel,"> One year already...Cyberpunk 2077 not fixed yet.  On year, I did not know.  I was thinking of a 9070XT earlier in spring, but choose... differently",Negative
Intel,welcome to amd,Positive
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative
Intel,"I'm receiving the same error in Event Viewer, but I have installed Ryzen Master. Most likely it's also a component of the Adrenalin drivers for system tuning and monitoring.

Intel,"That it did, lol. My only complaint.",Negative
Intel,"Not a problem on Linux with Wayland. Ever.   Main reason I ditched Windows 11, constant screen tearing and input lag made me go crazy.",Negative
Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother. Now I can hold 100+ FPS at all times, sometimes peaking over 200 FPS in some scenarios. And frame times are smooth as butter.",Negative

Intel,Epic version runs just fine.,Positive
Intel,Cyberpunk GOG last version patch runs fine on this driver.,Positive
Intel,"Hey there, can you give an example of how this looks now versus how it's supposed to?",Neutral
Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative
Intel,It's most likely the same as I've described here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/1ow4in7/comment/nop2o04/)  But yeah unfortunately seems like all you can do for now is either roll back to 25.10.2 or disable your iGPU if you don't use it,Negative
Intel,probably because those issues are build specific.  I've not had any freezing or locks on any drivers this whole year.,Neutral
Intel,"The game is booting, this message was for the 25.10 they just didn't removed it",Negative
Intel,I don't know your system specifications but in many cases setting the BIOS to PCIe v4 could help.     Try change in your bios,Neutral

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.

Intel,"I tried everything I saw online: meshes on low, XMP lower/off, chipset drivers reinstall and other stuff. Nothing worked.  I downgraded back to 25.9.1., haven't had a crash in days.  Kinda miss the improvements for AFMF they brought with 25.10 for other games, but eh I'd rather play BF6 without it crashing randomly.",Negative
Intel,"Didn't test long enough to see if it crashes as I reverted back to old driver when I noticed my gpu was permanently at 100% load which it never was before on old driver, doesn't feel like it's supposed to do that with a 9800x3d & 9070xt + 32gb ram, It's moving between 70-95% usage on old driver",Negative
Intel,Either launch with curseforge or rollback,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, didn’t work for me last driver either. I can get FSR4 to work in other games just not BF6",Negative
Intel,Sorry for not replying in time with the pictures but I just saw that on Twitter that Beat Saber and AMD are now aware of the issue. The distorted flickering issue on the walls.  https://xcancel.com/BeatSaber/status/1993629046802882685  However there's another issue. I had not actually tried to use an Index at 90Hz until the other day. I discovered that the latency bug is back for 90Hz mode. As in I have to adjust the photon latency to ~5ms in the Steam debug commands to make it usable but not fixed. Just like in the the drivers before 24.12.1.   120Hz mode still works fine.,Neutral
Intel,"Even the rollback doesn't fix it for me now. It being related to the combination of iGPU and GPU makes sense though. Sadly I actively use the iGPU, so thats not an option for me.",Negative
Intel,You 100 procent sure on this?,Neutral
Intel,I went back to 25.3 official gigabyte latest driver for 9070XT OC gaming and 2 days no crashes for now. Also changed HDMI for DP cable  I will also change in BIOS and completely disable integrated GPU in BIOS,Positive
Intel,"I had auto update on (my mistake), so it did install over the previous driver. I've downgraded for now and it seems to be working just fine.  But no, after uninstalling from control panel I booted into safe mod and used DDU.   Then I downloaded the newest installer from the website. Restarting where needed during this process.   Didn't matter how I tried to access the software. Wasn't active in the system tray, not there in task manager.   Right click on desktop and open from there, click the exe, or go into a game and try Alt R. Didn't open with any of these methods.",Neutral
Intel,Driver with -s letter after black screen and reboot PC tells me that this driver isn't for my graphic card🤡,Negative
Intel,"I had randomly black screens with 24.2.1, this was annoying as hell. Had to DDU the Driver and went back to 23.11.1, after this everything was fine.",Negative
Intel,Does fsr 4 work on 25.9.1? I thought the only driver that works without having to change any files and risk a ban online is 23. 9.1?,Neutral
Intel,"I had to rollback to driver 25.9.1, start up Star Citizen, switch the renderer to Vulkan, exit game, start SC again to verify it's working with Vulkan, then reinstall the latest driver again. Now it works, just don't switch it back to DirectX. No idea who dropped the ball on this one but Easy-Anticheat sure doesn't like the atidxx64.dll.",Neutral
Intel,I'm not sure. However when I install the driver it states that I cannot use adrenaline and gives me a link to the newest driver. Wondering if there is an earlier version of adrenaline I need to install.,Neutral
Intel,What do you mean extension update??? Do you mean lg firmware update or something Ina  windows update? Where do I find this?,Neutral
Intel,They do not.,Neutral
Intel,"Well, I used the system before the latest updates normally, for maybe half a year. Installed every update without DDU. I wanted to triple boot, formated the drive, left windows to install stock updates and drivers, went to install chipset and GPU driver and voila, every wakeup, just before I could type the pin, kernel panic and shutdown. DDU, just the driver, installed again, black screen. Went into DDU again, wanted to see if I missed anything and without reading, uninstalled everything AMD related, went into windows, installed chipset drivers from vendors site (ASUS) and then the latest GPU drivers, and havent had issues. I have a monitor connected via DP and a TV via HDMI.",Neutral
Intel,Dont buy an adapter. Most of them are trash and dont put out the advertised resolution and refresh rate. Not to mention most of them dont support vrr or HDR.,Negative
Intel,The one linked in the release notes is combined. (in the sense that it's two drivers in one executable) (And 1.6GB)  .....amd.com/drivers/whql-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-25.11.1-win11-nov-combined.exe,Neutral
Intel,"AND is taking away one additional driver feature per day, you say?",Negative
Intel,"Yes, I’m talking about 25.10.2 (posted the other day here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/s/nNunS1QlFX ). If you go to AMD download page and select “GPU” you get a file that has a different dimension from the one you download if you choose “CPU”. If you do the following steps 1) DDU (or AMD CleanUp Utility), 2) install CPU drivers => GPU not recognized or with a generic driver. If the you install the GPU driver you get the GPU correctly recognized and a yellow esclamation mark on the integrated. To have both VGAs working at the same time I have to download the AMD Auto Detect package (the file name ends with “minimal_install), but Adrenalin App does not open.",Neutral
Intel,Thank you for explaining it before the rage baiters go nuts.,Neutral
Intel,I've been following this one pretty closely. Unfortunately the fix *just* missed 25.11.1 release cycle; we hope to get this out in the next one.,Negative
Intel,"I have a 7900XTX and have this issue at times. It normally clears quickly on its own, but seeing pink pixels on the screen worried me that I had an issue with the actual hardware",Negative
Intel,"I totally understand. if you're running with an affected display config, you should be fine on 25.9.1 or the 25.10.1 preview driver for BF6. We'll get this out as soon as we can.",Neutral
Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP. I've also never experienced BSODs until the last week or two, since i did a fresh install and I've had the same monitors/PCs for a long time.",Neutral
Intel,Don't apologise - this one is worth getting upset over. Hope it's fixed for you all very soon.,Negative
Intel,Was yours the DisplayPort config or HDMI? I may have a fix for this ready if you're available test,Neutral
Intel,Can you provide me some context? Are there any posts detailing the issue either here or at the chromium project side?,Neutral
Intel,Already launched in COD 7,Neutral
Intel,"Im currently using dp 1.4 on my 7900 gre.  My monitor has 2.1 hdmi, so you’re saying i shoulf switch to hdmi?",Neutral
Intel,Some of us are using DP 2.1 though. DP 1.4 is a thing of the past.,Neutral
Intel,Are you sure? The steam machine has HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.4 listed in the specifications,Neutral
Intel,"Ah ok, that definitely makes sense if you're using a TV. Hope they straighten it out for you soon.",Neutral
Intel,What I did is get the 25.8.1 drivers shut off the fluid motion frames and in Windows set bf6 to run full power on your graphics card. Try some of those things and see if that helps you.,Neutral
Intel,"I tried to reinstall the chipset drivers, the same error, tried to install the drivers from gigabyte site the second screen worked but uninstalled adrenaline and it ran the auto update that disabled the secondary screen and the issue of no adrenaline opening came back, going back to older version, thanks AMD",Neutral
Intel,With the compiled leaked DLL you can use it on RDNA3 as well.,Neutral
Intel,"Wait until December, there's the 5th anniversary and they'll supposedly drop something new.",Neutral
Intel,For me playing it with path tracing on eventually the game crashes. Had no issues playing with ray tracing: psycho though.,Negative
Intel,Amen to that. Not a single crash since the game released on CachyOS. (9070 XT),Positive
Intel,Thank you! Exciting keen to see what it’s like,Positive
Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative
Intel,yes i tried it ... maybe it is because of the 7800X3D ... i really dont know... i will wait for the next patch ... should come tomorrow 18.11. ... but i have read so many threads and i am not the only one...,Neutral
Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .  I should have sold the 7700 xt and bought 9060 xt 16gb instead but too late for that now and it has problems as well, so lottery as i said, its a risk.",Negative
Intel,"I see, btw I'm just telling the natural AMD trends on its major update/features on its GPU (kinda). Wish it coming sooner..",Neutral
Intel,lmao chill out dude go touch some grass,Negative
Intel,Could be grounds for lawsuit… That’s funny!,Neutral
Intel,Because of MPO.,Neutral
Intel,yeah same with 25.11.1 25.9.2 works for me,Positive
Intel,"25.10.2 was the previous WHQL, so also yes :P",Positive
Intel,"Huh, seems to be running in DX12 for me, as reported by MSI AB, and FSR4 is working",Neutral
Intel,Which driver version and does it still crashing?,Neutral
Intel,OK I will install it now and test it and get back to you. Give me 10 mins.,Neutral
Intel,Yuppp. It does not work on bf6 but it works on ark survival ascended for me. Seems it might be a bf issue. I saw ppl saying they were getting more fps with this driver in BF6 but I think they didn't realize it's using FSR 3.1 and not 4.,Negative
Intel,I'll work with the engineer from that ticket check if that issue has somehow regressed.,Neutral
Intel,We've not been able to reproduce this internally so far. Can you remind me which GPU (was this a 7900XTX?) + connectivity method you're using?,Neutral
Intel,Try using DDU to uninstall your current drivers and do a clean install of the 25.10.2 combined drivers if you havent already (you can find it here):  https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html,Neutral
Intel,"Yup just need to say ""No""",Neutral
Intel,"whew thanks, good think i noticed it first before updating. i have 25.10.2 and 25.9.2 here and they both have windows 10 along their filename so i might as well asked.",Positive
Intel,I don't see how it would work on 23.9.1 lol,Negative
Intel,"Did you use DDU to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall using a driver installer from the AMD website? I found this guide yesterday and it was extremely helpful, specifically step 8:  https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1lnxb8o/ultimate_amd_performance_fix_guide_stop_lag_fps/",Positive
Intel,I did it this morning before the new driver and confirm chipset drivers were untouched,Neutral
Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.  More people use HDMI than what people think and those TVs don’t always have a DP connector at all.,Negative
Intel,"ah, that explains it. Thanks. :)",Positive
Intel,"What if one does not check release notes? V25.10.2 point to different packages, for installing both CPU and GPU you had to download the AutoDetect package (named “minimal install”). Obviously I’m referring to AMD driver download page.",Neutral
Intel,"Okay, as long as they have a workaround for that... I was planning to get a 9060XT, but also keep my 6700XT for lossless scaling frame gen, was worried the branching would affect that..",Neutral
Intel,"What a mess. I have rdna2 and 3 on the same PC, so combined driver is the solution for this? Or auto detect is the only way?",Negative
Intel,"Damn, that's a huge relief to hear. Most of the frustration came from not knowing whether the issue was even acknowledged.   Thanks a lot for the update.",Positive
Intel,What about Noise Suppression not working since 25.9.2?,Negative
Intel,Finally. The last driver without pink artifacting was 25.4.1  It has been 7 months. AMD Matt acknowledged the bug on [the amd forums](https://pcforum.amd.com/s/question/0D5KZ000011WpJJ0A0/pink-square-artifacting-chrome-discord-and-steam) 5 months ago.  Please let it be fixed with the next driver update. So many 7000series users are on the verge of swapping to Nvidia.  https://i.redd.it/ywrg9at3lp1g1.gif,Neutral
Intel,"what about whatever changed post 25.3.1 for multi monitors? Any driver 25.3.1 and older i can run my main at 200hz, my side at 165, and my third at 60 without issue. Any driver newer than 25.3.1 and running my main at 200hz then playing a game will cause the second monitor (165hz) to flicker, glitch, and freak out the entire time, until the game on the main monitor is closed. Dropping to 165 on the main monitor down from 200hz \*fixes\* the issue but, i paid for 200hz and would like to be able to actually use it again.  (7700xt system)",Neutral
Intel,Hell yeah 🙂 amd I appreciate you see the issues Iv been a fan boy for a long time and I know it will be fixed,Positive
Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations. [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1jayump/chrome_full_screen_freezes_after_switching_to_amd/) [Or here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/3890720/parts-of-screen-freezes-when-using-chrome) Chrome (or other Chromium browsers, I've had this happen with Edge too) in fullscreen, with graphics acceleration enabled.   Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive
Intel,"lol, listened too much to linus  https://youtu.be/g3FkuZNSGkw?t=261",Neutral
Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
Intel,"Don't do that, i'm suffering with both 7900XTX + RVII (and even with RX6400)",Negative
Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Neutral
Intel,"We've not observed anything like this internally, and I've personally not seen this at all in the field. This one may be specific to your display combination. I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows. One of our community testers encountered this and remedied with the overlayminFPS DWORD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/?sort=new  If you're getting TDRs, with chome(ium) + gameplay, pass us over a kernel memory dmp and we'll take a look into it",Neutral
Intel,"Oh yeah I noticed that too when watching it, kinda funny of him to say it as it's on screen",Positive
Intel,I've had a really stable 60 fps experience even with path tracing (minus the crashes) but I'm on a 9070 with fsr 4 on quality,Positive
Intel,Can't comment on the vanishing of the tray since I have mine configured to hide it from tray always.,Neutral
Intel,also i have coil whine since this driver 25.11.1. ?!  also in idle sometimes...  very strange driver...,Negative
Intel,Every roadmap since forever has a small print disclaimer at the bottom at the page saying that release times are subject to change.,Neutral
Intel,"I upgraded from 25.9 because it started crashing, it was not crashing until yesterday, also I have limited gpu usage, clockspeed it is working sometimes, sometimes not.",Neutral
Intel,We've still not been able to reproduce this unfortunately. I'll need to check in when I'm back at work next year,Negative
Intel,Didn't really paid attention to it :( but at least my game doesn't crash anymore!!,Negative
Intel,"did you download the same filename with the one i mentioned? i tried downloading windows 11 link and it also gave me the same filename, lol",Neutral
Intel,No you can't.,Neutral
Intel,"I don' think you understand either, 25.9.1 is that driver, 23.9.1 was released in 2023 before FSR 4 was even a thing.",Negative
Intel,"Glad I could help, the crashes on Arc Raiders were pissing me off big style so I wanted to share what helped me.",Positive
Intel,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
Intel,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, that didn't fix it. Chrome continues to forget to update its display. And WoW continues to crash in the background leading to massive stutters when panning the camera around quickly, along with plenty of other odd behaviours.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Positive
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative
Intel,What about 25.11.1?,Neutral
Intel,Yeah same for me. Considering how similair win10 and 11 are under the hood i just went with it. Still absolutely no problems sofar.,Positive

Intel,"Haha. Sure thing buddy. If that would be the case, that a small print on a roadmap can't save a company, we would have hundreds of lawsuits in EU. You must be new to the hardware scene.",Negative
Intel,thank you,Positive
Intel,"Uh huh, yeah I did it too. You still have the overwrite DLLs. Hence the flipping tutorial. Completely irrelevant to this topic, anyways.",Negative
Intel,"Not a typo, I was asking about something else and he missed my point...",Negative
Intel,"Yes, it can't.   They could add that they can sell your organs, doesn't make it legal though.   Also lawsuits usually don't happen because of a feature or if they happen, in a very small amount that isn't meaningful. Class action also doesn't exist in Europe, so obviously you won't hear about it like in the USA.",Negative
Intel,"But flipping the dlls could get you banned from online games , that's why i was wondering if it's finally fixed in this update and we wouldn't have to flip the dlls anymore..",Negative

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software.

Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral

Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.

It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case.

Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

Intel,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",Neutral

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture. Direct passthrough is also possible without too many hacks like AMD do(*cough* vendor-reset *cough*).  People always consider Intel graphics processors as a laughing stock but you gotta respect them for the accessibility of vGPU solution, directly on integrated graphics that everyone gets.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock.

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).

It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,"i'm no expert but i dove in to Wiki      it was a [1GB/s to 3.25GB/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface) interface. For refference PCI-E 2.0 was 1GB/s and 3.0 was 2GB/s BUT per lane so 16 and 32GB/s.  For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral

AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W.

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
Intel,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

There's also already laptops listed on sites like Best Buy for reasonable prices (sub $1300).

Intel,"Very unlikely. Proton and DXVK work alright with x86 but adding ARM conversion on top is, uh, a **very** poor experience.

Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances. Anything that can increase incompatibility rate (and it VERY well can, ARM **does not** support AVX2 natively for instance meaning [a lot of games that might have issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1dekmtz/avx2_game_list/) even starting or underperform).",Negative

Valve says they know what they want, it's just not ready yet. I think as great as Panther Lake benchmarks are, the biggest complaint of the Steam Deck is still the 2ish hours of battery life in more demanding titles.  With the existence of other handhelds already, I don't think Valve is trying to aim for the beefier spec department here, if it means the same battery life.",Negative

Intel,"That's a bit of a different case, because they are designing a new product either way they might as well look into supporting something like LPCAMM2. They already have a mainboard for the FW13 that can support these newer CPUs, so there has to be a very compelling reason to spend money to redesign that, which I think a single Intel SKU is not unfortunately.",Neutral
Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.  But you won't see DDR5 SO-DIMM designs - if they claim to be DDR5 SO-DIMM and Arc B390 then its wrong.",Neutral

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,"Intel's GPU division has been operating at a loss never mind Intel as a whole and ARC series cards aren't as popular as the enthusiast circles would have you believe.

Intel,What is taking Nividia so long with the super cards?,Negative
Intel,"Battlemage gpu chips are made through TSMC and Intel is getting screwed on supply, this is why even if the B770 comes it will only be a small amount. Hopefully Intel can put together enough rare earth to pump out discrete Celestial Gpus but it takes time to ramp everything up. In addition Intel has their chiplet design, EMIB that could take off soon. They may be able to bring Apple back into the fold, but let us hope Discrete Arc lives on.

Intel,"These are European links and will be out of stock. I found a mom and pop place back in my old stomping grounds in San Francisco, and they normally only sell B60s in prebuilt systems but a special order is possible.

May your Bits Byte Hard, long live the Arc.",Neutral
Intel,"If CES 2026 comes and goes without any details for Discrete Arc GPUs then it could be awhile.

Intel,Not sure how the link being European matters. They are European shops and the B60 is in stock.,Neutral
Intel,"We kind of know where it will land. It will be a 3050M level chip, maybe a bit better, but will have improve scaling and frame gen.   8060S is 40 RDNA 3.5 units. One Xe3 unit is about 2.1 RDNA 3.5 units. That put it at about 65% of Strix Halo, though it will have a worse memory bus and no MALL cache. Somewhere in that range.   So that 60% is almost bang on the 3050M. Maybe a bit better. It won’t be like the 4050 but 3050M isn’t bad for an iGPU that fits in a normal socket",Neutral

Intel,"I don’t know how this score compares to the 3050M. I only know that this score is about 55% of the B580. And the B580, at 2K and 4K, is about 1.7–2 times the performance of the desktop 3050",Neutral
Intel,and also an iGPU won't be stuck with 6GB of vRAM 😅,Neutral
Intel,Really don't understand why they don't go with a larger cache.  Pretty sure they still have a bunch of cache chunks spread all around the SoC.,Negative

AMD,"9% more power for 7% more performance is actually a pretty good deal, when you consider that that 9% more power is just for the CPU. Factoring in the entire energy cost of a full system, that easily amounts to a PPW uplift.",Positive
AMD,9% power for 7% performance doesn't sound that bad?,Neutral
AMD,"It's 7% in Geekbench only. There's been no other news/leaks about how it performs in other benchmarks and games so it could quite possibly see a higher increase under other loads (or conversely, see a decrease where the extra cache is not utilized).",Neutral
AMD,The main benefit is simplification of running software. You'd no longer desire to choose which CCD to pin a program to for the best experience and can just let a program use both.,Positive
AMD,It's to make the specs sheet look beefier. Actual power draw and efficiency should be virtually identical to the 9950X3D. If you increase the PPT manually to 250W on the 9950X3D you'd get similar results in everything apart from heavy cache-sensitive computing workloads.,Neutral

AMD,"afaik there has never been a correlation between geekbench and gaming performance, pretty lame how people eat up the headlines even if they're meaningless",Negative
AMD,I think it depends a lot on how exactly the software/ hardware works. If the workload still has to fetch from the other CCD then it won't make a difference.,Neutral
AMD,"There's still a latency penalty since it's two separate caches, so it will still be best to keep it on one in a lot of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah but there will always be one CCD that will be faster,Neutral

AMD,"Nah, total system impact is always something we should consider, because it's the most meaningful to us as users with workloads to run and bills to pay.  The fact we can buy parts as individual units doesn't mean they should only be considered that way.",Neutral
AMD,We have had x600 vs x600X for like every ryzen generation that has had way more power for minimal performance increase.   Exiting the power sweetspot has been every enthusiasts dream buying the fastest gaming cpu on the market.   PBO being a commonly recommended feature blows past efficiency curve for minimal performance gains.  This is just a slighly better binned cpu. It doesn't feel like 14nm+++ yet.,Positive
AMD,"It's not only that. There is no direct comparison. Someone (anonymous) ran the Geekbench Benchmark and uploaded the results afterwards.  Someone found that result and chose a random result of a regular 9950X3D and used that as a baseline. Both benchmarks were not run on the same system or by the same person. No one knows if these results are in any form comparable or useful.   What we don't know:   \-exact Windows version   \-power limits   \-RAM configuration    \-overclocking yes or no   \-what was the background load? You can run Geekbench while doing something else.   For all Ryzen 9 9950X3D the results differ a lot. The fastest 9950X3D entries are like 30-35% higher than the lowest ones.    The best 9950X3D results are better than the presented 9950X3D.      There is only one logical explanation for this article:   Someone wanted to cash in on the hype for the 9950X3D2 and chose some existing 9950X3D result as a baseline without any explanation.    With all the results, the 9950X3D2 is up to 30% faster or up to 5% slower than the 9950X3D, for any claim between that there would have been results to go with.   But looks like someone thought 7% is positive enough to please the AMD community but also not  so unrealistic that anyone would question the methodology.    If you look behind it, it's just made up.   Not even AI slop is that bad.    But tech/hardware media can afford that, the people who consume that are dumb enough to buy that, that's why lying/making up stories became a multi million (possibly billion) dollar industry.",Neutral
AMD,"> [Paraphrasing] >  > Some programs perform worse when split across multiple CCD because the cache is not shared between the CCD.  But... all of AMD's CPU's with multiple CCD run in to that issue and for most things can be ignored, that's not unique to the X3D design.",Negative
AMD,Good for simulation computing and games that have similar workloads. Single-threaded perf gains nothing like you said.,Neutral
AMD,I use a 7800x3D to play at 1440p and im almost always CPU bottlenecked. This is because the type of games i enjoy are  CPU bottlenecked. Even this CPU would mean im CPU bottlenecked.,Negative

AMD,"More than that, won't any modern motherboard just refuse to POST with no RAM?",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, L4 cache is invisible to x86-64. It’s managed automatically by the processor and cannot be eg used as RAM.  There might be undocumented ways you could interact/manage this (modern processors have lots of ‘undefined’ instructions; usually used for debugging)    That is more of a design and ISA decision however. Physically it is possible.",Neutral
AMD,"You got downvoted but that’s very true, Digital Foundry does game benchmarking for CPUs perfect for that reason in my opinion. They max the RT, turn the resolution down to 1080p and turn DLSS to a low internal res, that way they’re not GPU bound but they still get all the extra CPU overhead that RT brings",Neutral

AMD,"The 7700K vs 6700K test was GPU-limited, so it not showing any significant differences isn't surprising. Similar for the 9900K test, as the 1080 Ti wasn't fast enough.

The 8700K test shows that for CPU loads, the 7700K scored 84.0% while the 6700K was at 77.2%, that's a 9% improvement, the 8700K showed a 19% improvement over the 7700K. The 9900K showed another 19% uplift over the 8700K in the CPU test department.",Neutral

AMD,"Both should be considered, but they should be decoupled when looking at benchmarks. You are right that TCO is important.",Positive
AMD,"Well, it's supposed to have twice the 3d cache too, so that would be where the real gains are. ISO performance in non cache sensitive tasks would have even been fine, but if they want to hyper bin parts to push the performance too for a very premium price, they'll get a couple whales. I'm guessing this will be somewhat low volume as a part.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean no, you can't ignore it, that's how it works.",Neutral
AMD,You just set default to non x3d ccd and pin all games to x3d so that everything running in the background is on the non x3d cores and any non game program that needs more cores will just use both.,Neutral
AMD,"games that do simulation will all want to use combined cache so you dont want them using multiple CCDs. If you got some paralelized simulation software though, yeah it will be good.",Neutral
AMD,This exactly. Games that tend to bottleneck CPUs tend to be relatively easy to run GPU-wise and vice versa. Games that punish both heavily are extremely rare.  Depending on the types of games people play they could experience CPU bottlenecks even at 1440p or even 4K. Bannerlod and X4 I feel are great examples.,Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't really matter either way since after all, the use cases are both extremely unrealistic. What matters is that the test stays consistent between benchmarks.  With benchmarks you're not trying to figure out how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game. What you're trying to figure out is how many it's pumping out vs. other CPUs (i.e. the relative performance). Because of that it doesn't really matter whether all the tested CPUs hover around 100 FPS or 600 FPS.",Negative
AMD,"That was 2 years ago (zen3 itself being almost 6 years old) and only worked out because the 5000 series GPUs only went up to 5700xt, so the naming didn't overlap. The last two generations haven't had an XT (we get 7950x instead of 7900xt).",Neutral
AMD,"When comparing 6700k vs 7700k, GNs benching showed that even synthetics like Cinebench had less than 5% MC uplift at stock and less than 6% uplift in SC. Ashes of Singularity had a 2.7% uplift. They did not compare 6700k vs 7700k OCd.   8700k becomes harder to compare because they changed testing methodology and the OCd 8700k was delidded.",Neutral
AMD,They actually peaked at zen 3 in 2021. The couple of moments when Intel was still on 14nm for the H series before Tiger Lake-H and when the Intel U series was still quad core was when Cezanne looked the most competitive.   But they never managed to fully capitalise on it due to shitty supply and shitty OEM cooperation.,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly! If you're someone frequently running special software that's significantly impacted by a split cache then you shouldn't be buying a CPU that does that.  Thankfully most software just wants more cores, higher clock speed and higher IPC with increases to cache capacity being a *bonus*. Cache being split, not shared across CCD's just doesn't factor in to it for I imagine most consumers.",Negative
AMD,"I think he means can ignore in a sense that the penalty, while still existing, wont impact consumer experience. If the extra latency means ill open my PDF file 5ms later, thats no problem for me. Its only in heavy load software where it really becomes an issue, gaming, enterprise compute, etc.",Neutral
AMD,"You’re right that it doesn’t matter if your benchmarking is purely academic, but figuring out exactly how many frames a CPU can pump out in a game is important if you’re also looking to understand which GPU you should buy.  You still get to compare relative performance as long as you keep the benchmarks consistent like you said, but if you max the CPU then you also get a real FPS number you can compare to GPU reviews to check whether you’ll be CPU or GPU limited at your target res and settings",Neutral
AMD,"Well yeah, except for the Ryzen 5600 XT, which has the exact same number and suffix as the Radeon 5600 XT.",Neutral
AMD,We also had a 5950X. Stop trying to pretend there is any sort of consistency where there is absolutely none.,Negative
AMD,"No, you said you don't need to pin processes with this and I'm explaining why that's not true. Saying ""just ignore it"" is weird.",Negative
AMD,"in the context of this CPU i don't think anyone is worried about opening PDF files or other basic tasks. the main use case of this is people running demanding software that may benefit from the large core count and cache, in which case yeah they're going to care and be doing their research.",Neutral
AMD,I don't think a consumer is going to be so confused they buy a GPU instead of a CPU.   I doubt anyone buys these products based on model name alone without any other research.,Negative

AMD,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
AMD,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
AMD,"They've basically maxed out the 128-bit normal socket iGPU now.  For them to beat it they need more memory bandwidth - they can put in a bit more cache, but realistically they'll need a quad channel bus (or maybe they can wait for LPDDR6 at 14.4+).  They can probably have a bit more physical room in the next generation of sockets, but without more bandwidth it isn't *that* useful.",Neutral

AMD,Why aren't they comparing the AMD 8060S in the current Strix Halo flagship to the Intel B390? Probably because it doesn't go intel's way... interesting.,Neutral

AMD,They need a 25% IPC increase to get back to the leading edge in CPU and honestly i don't see it with their current architecture. They need a new radical design   Edit: getting downvoted for what?. Currently Apple and QC have a very solid lead.

Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand.

AMD,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral

AMD,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative

Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores.

AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

AMD,"I bought a Gigabyte Windforce OC 5070ti for $750 about three weeks ago. The cheapest I can find it in stock right now is $1300.  With Nvidia saying they're going to de-prioritize the 5060ti 16GB, if AMD can keep the 9060xt 16GB and 9070xt in stock at somewhat reasonable prices then they have the best 1080p and 1440p option.",Neutral
AMD,"Bruh what? That’s the craziest thing I’ve read so far.  DLSS 4.5 hype is most likely not a botting conspiracy because NVIDIA is trying to ward negative sentiment, and more likely due to there being a larger market of people who can test the thing out for free.  Again, need I mention that NVDIA has most likely sold more 50 series cards than AMD has sold 90 series cards? Not to mention that DLSS 4.5 still runs optimally on 40 series cards, and runs at all on 20 and 30 series cards.   This wide coverage of people getting a free upgrade will naturally generate hype.  As for the 9070 XT being the best bang for buck once the 5070 Ti is shitcanned, this will be true, though sadly not as good of a bang of a buck before the whole VRAM apocalypse went down.",Neutral
AMD,Shades of the old Phenom II dual-core CPUs that had four fully functional cores that could be unlocked on certain motherboards.,Neutral
AMD,My assumption is that it's a low stock product so they aren't going to sell them for now while they build up supply.,Neutral
AMD,Also makes sense to push for higher margin since they have the same VRAM capacity,Neutral
AMD,"Thats a given, but both can be true that AMD may also no longer have enough stock to justify the sku.",Neutral
AMD,"That's dumb, both cards have the same exact memory, so making a non-XT shouldn't have any effect on the XT from a VRAM standpoint. Spork is likely correct about high yields leading to low supply of defective dies. AMD really optimized the frick out of that N48 die.",Negative
AMD,The steam survey is hardly scientific and can wildly swing between surveys. You have to look at the long term trends to get a good picture which GPU’s are popular with consumers.,Neutral
AMD,"No, as far as I'm aware it's not possible. The likely answer here is that they do not have that many defective chips anyway so they're prioritising the SKU that is sold for more (same chip).",Negative
AMD,"My understanding is that TSMC wafers tend to be batched - switching to new masks takes time and cost more than making everything in one go and keeping dies in a warehouse which are then binned, packaged and put on cards to sell.  There's a decent chance that the silicon has already been produced, and has for some time. They can't do anything to change their quality.",Negative
AMD,"The screaming sentiment in /r/radeon for the last couple weeks has been the polar opposite of this.   Sooo many shrill posts about ""Nvidia supports all of their GPUs with DLSS4.5 and FSR4 is for the newest GPUs only! I'm selling my Radeon and buying a 5070Ti!"". Weirdly including people that claim to have RX9000 GPUs.  For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/s/VcHeMoArKj",Negative
AMD,Same with some 4 core ones that could be unlocked to 6 (960T comes to mind),Neutral
AMD,more margin on the xt,Neutral
AMD,I'm sure the RX 9070 at 0.14% while the 5070 is at over 2% says enough...  *Also yeah the XT isn't even on there*,Neutral
AMD,Something like that. They can just use 9070 firmware on a 9070xt chip instead of physically disabling stuff on the chip. It certainly would not be the first time lol.   Imagine it being the opposite of the situation when nvidia couldn't keep 3090s on the shelf. They were probably selling the worst possible qualifying chip as a 3090 to maximize profits. So if you got a 3080 it was probably the worst of the worst lol.   This case would be the opposite if demand for the 9070xt was so weak (compared to 9070 sales) that they started selling the good chips as 9070s to move them. You're more likely to get a really good 9070 chip that might even work as a 9070xt with the right firmware lol.,Neutral
AMD,"There were at least reports in past months with from people with screenshots with 9070XT's of it showing up on the hardware survey as ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" the same it shows for APU/iGPU graphics.  I don't doubt in my mind both GPUs got outsold by the 5070 and 5070ti but I also have seen that's hard to get actual numbers from Steam so we don't know. But I imagine some percent of that 2+% of ""AMD Radeon Graphics"" are 9070XTs, I'm pretty sure they sold more than 0 9070XTs.  Reminder when the RX480/RX580 were priced against like 2GB 60 series Nvidia GPUs while having 4 times the VRAM and nearly double the performance for the same money they still got outsold like 5 to 1 by the Nvidia GPUs. And this is a pre-RT and upscaling era so none of the bells and whistles/software suite type features would be a reason either. So even in situations where an AMD card is just flat out better in every way, it still usually gets outsold hand over fist, so in situations where it's debatable or worse it's an even wider margin.",Neutral
AMD,">So if you got a 3080 it was probably the worst of the worst lol.  Have the 3080 12GB - below the 3080 Ti, and then the 3090, all using the same die - despite having the EVGA FTW3 version (more power!), it was a dog.     So, can confirm!

AMD,"Got a B850-I and 9800X3D... I do wonder if those affected had done some tweaks, like PBO or BIOS settings.  I do have to say, during my build, I did notice some quality issues with my board. Once i installed my M.2, that stupid toolless metal bar thing bent so hard it made contact with components on the daughterboard. Had to disassemble everything to get to that piece and bend it straight. During the process i noticed that one of the heatsink screws for the VRM had snapped off.

AMD,"I don't think it's anything like the Intel situation, and I'm not personally convinced that ASRock ever were actually killing them faster. I think the ASRock community just picked up on it first and started documenting it first.  Gamers Nexus and Wendell from Level 1 Techs have both been trying to get some insight and they can't replicate or make an ASRock board kill a CPU, and they've even been using boards that have had CPUs die in them before.  It does seem to be some sort of manufacturing issue, but Intel's one was pretty much 100% of specific models of CPUs were affected by this issue and would eventually fail.  AMD's issue doesn't seem to be this. I think it just looks a lot more common than it is because of how many CPUs AMD is selling now.",Negative
AMD,"We've been hearing about dying X3Ds on ASRock since the start and the occasional GB board, which if it's the same cause would preclude it being any single batch problem and instead more of a general design or systemic issue.

AMD,"Yes, they're pretty good but very clearly a few steps below where they sit in single threaded performance.  Intel is also on an architecture that's burdened with Windows (which is a far worse OS in terms of battery life and bloat and which isn't tailored to those CPUs like MacOS is for Apple) and which wasn't targeted for low power usage until just now. Lunar Lake is their first real attempt at that and it's miles closer than any attempt before it. Before this it was basically just the desktop CPU that was fit into a laptop.  M3 was Apples 3rd gen. Again, Lunar Lake was the first for Intel and iirc Apple actually helped make N3 in the first place so they're far more familiar with the nodes when they develop their CPUs. And Lunar Lake is a chiplet design iirc which has some inherent issues with efficiency and means that it's not pure N3 but a mix of more and less efficient nodes.  Having memory on the same SOC and the Node advantage absolutely play a critical role in the performance Apple has achieved per watt. It reduces power consumption and allows much higher bandwidth and reduces some of the logic Apple needs to make.  Also, have we seen the benchmarks for 18A? I'm not sure it's better than N3P. Definitely more at home for Intel though.  Do you have some benchmarks for Panther Lake CPUs? The only ones I've found focus on the igpu.",Neutral

BUT as said amd did sell those cards at higher prices to partners and sellers and what not, but did not rebate the cards, but only a very tiny fraction.  so it was NOT a real msrp, but it was perfectly setup to nicely fool people like you (no offense, the corpos are our enemy and try to lie to everyone possible), so that people like you do not rightfully point out the scam run by evil amd.  so DO NOT let amd the lying scum get away with those lies. THEY setup the fake msrp to lie to the public. the banked on most people not hearing the reporting on what actually is going on and they also banked on people not understanding, that amd is in 100% control of what price cards actually sell at.  so again you are WRONG and i am again correct with this statement:  >if amd would have wanted over 50% of all supply for example to be AT msrp, then it would have been at msrp  also i said 50% here, because that is a reasonable number, as partners of course should be free to still buy the gpu + memory at the same price, but then add value of a better cooler or vrm or other features, to add 20-50 us dollars more at the final price for example, for the higher end models.",Negative

AMD does not release the INT8 model because they do not want to, it only took a single person to compile the binary.

And while the RAM situation is horrible, it's not going to last forever. It may take several years for the situation to ease if things continue the way they are.

AMD,"My rig started as 3600X + GTX 1080 w/ 2x8gb. Now it's on its 3rd CPU (5700X, now 5800X3D) and 3rd GPU (3080 that died in November, now 5070 Ti) and has 4x8gb of the same RAM. I'll probably keep it as-is for at least another 2-3 years, probably longer. Getting 10 years out of one platform is insane.",Neutral
AMD,"Zen 3 without X3D is still a big step up for gaming from Zen 2, due to the unified CCD.  About 20% on average, with many cases of 30% plus.",Positive
AMD,3700X to 5950X here. Extremely worth it if you’re using your PC for something other than gaming,Positive
AMD,I went from 3700x to 5950x (i do a lot of photo and video work). The change was incredible.,Positive
AMD,Or the 5950X if you need more cores.,Neutral

AMD,"AM4 had many, many issues with its releases that are now ignored and everyone pretends it was wonderful.",Negative
AMD,The DDR shortage is specifically Sam Altman's doing.,Negative
AMD,"Uh, definitely not. Games have been performing like the developers only have the very latest high performance GPU in their lab targeting 1440p/60FPS with that hardware.",Neutral
AMD,"lol. I always try to resell anything I'm retiring. That said, during the 2000s and early 2010s, tech moved so fast that 3+ year tech didn't retain much value. As a result, I have a framed shadowbox with a Pentium 1, an Athlon T-bird, 2 Athlon XPs, 2 Athlon 64s, and two Phenoms, lol.",Neutral
AMD,r/VintageComputing or r/RetroBattleStations is calling!,Neutral
AMD,"That's a 5800X3D, though. And also, it depends on your area.  If you live somewhere techy, the resale value will be *lower.* Because there's just more of them. (San Jose, CA)  My 5800X3D only went for $300~. No one wanted to give me more than $50 for my X570 board, and RAM hadn't skyrocketed yet. So I just gifted the board/32GB RAM to my SO's brother who was still gaming on a 6th gen Intel and a Radeon 7800XT. He slapped a 5700X3D in it and off he went. The 5700X3D he got for $200 2nd hand.",Neutral
AMD,"Also would likely require more engineering. My assumption is that when they moved to AM5 they got rid of some baggage, changed the memory subsystem, power management, etc. It's probably not just plug-and-play.",Neutral

AMD,5950GEX3D,Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately, it's hampered by the fact that it has two CCXs with two cores each. It doesn't make sense to put L3 cache there. A revamped 5800x/5800x3d with a better manufacturing process would allow for higher frequencies. Maybe some small improvements from Zen3+ (mobile)",Negative
AMD,yes the x,Positive
AMD,Running a 3700X with 64Gb RAM (I upgraded from 32Gb when DDR4 3200 was cheap a few years back and thought I'd wait another Zen generation) and a Radeon 9060 XT with 16Gb of VRAM... plenty of CPU power even for running gentoo (software installs are mostly built from source) and a Windows 11 VM for work...  I suppose I could upgrade the m/b from a B450 to B550 model to get PCIe 4 and faster USB and 2.5GBe but I feel no need to jump to a 5700X ... yet...,Neutral
AMD,"Same here, got an X370 board, a Ryzen 1800X and 16 GB of DDR4-3000 back in 2017. Then I upgraded to a 3800X and then to a 5950X and 32 GB of DDR4-3600. Still on the same, now 9 years old motherboard.  If AMD were to put out a 5950X3D I guess I could use it for another 5+ years.",Neutral
AMD,"Regular Zen3 is still great for gaming, it just gets overshadowed by X3D (for good reason). Hardware Unboxed recently did a comparison of several different Zen3 CPU's.  Also keep in mind many CPU gaming benchmarks are done at 1080p or even 720p with something like a 4090. In reality, for a budget DDR4 build you're more likely to use a much lower tier GPU, while running games at 1440p (1440p monitors are nearly the same price as 1080p these days) so the difference won't be as exaggerated.",Positive
AMD,"That's not a 'big' step up.  That's a pretty mild step up.    Most people dont upgrade their CPU every new generation, and that's basically all this is effectively.  The only real consolation here is that Zen 3 CPU's pass muster in modern games better than Zen 2 CPU's do.  So for that I can understand it, but you're only doing it to get over a line, not because it's actually a big improvement.",Negative
AMD,The irony of AMD's best AM4 gaming CPUs having a single CCD is so thick you could cut it with a knife.,Negative
AMD,"How's the 5900XT feel compared to the 5600X?  I'm still sitting on my 5600X and don't generally need more cores, but would still like a performance boost. Kind of an ironic situation to be in as the 5600X was originally the better buy at the time because it had the highest single core/thread clocks.",Neutral
AMD,"So in terms of value and upgradability, what's a better platform in your opinion?   I had issues sure (first gen was flaky with ram), but as an early adopter still using my motherboard from 2017, with a 3900X, and still having an upgrade path, I've gotten my moneys worth.",Neutral

AMD,I don't think I get your point.  That's only true because the only V-cache models released on AM4 had a single CCD.,Neutral
AMD,"The 5900XT has twice as much L3 cache and higher clocks, it's a little better. If you don't need more cores I wouldn't bother.  I also wonder about the 5600x (and 7600x/9600x). 6C/12T doesn't seem much but they seem to do well anyway. I wonder at what point of background tasks the 8 core chips start to become a noticable improvement.",Neutral
AMD,"oh i meant to say my server still runs the 5600 and i want a 5900, but id assume beefy for multicore apps and a little better on single core.",Neutral
AMD,How are your USB ports and wifi/bluetooth?,Neutral
AMD,"First gen was flaky for a number of reasons.  Another is that many people who bought boards for Zen 1 were shit out of luck if they wanted to upgrade to Zen 3.  Zen 1 was also fairly lackluster in terms of single thread performance, and main selling point was really just being able to have a 6 or 8 core CPU at a more affordable overall price point.  Which was great dont get me wrong, but Intel CPU's were still pretty clearly faster in almost all cases at the time for gaming.  Zen 2 was AM4's real arrival in my opinion, helped a lot by Intel stumbling off a cliff at the time.  But if you got in with Zen 2, then your upgrade path was ok, but it wasn't half as miraculous as people make it out to be unless you went for Zen 3 Vcache parts specifically.    AM4 was definitely good and worthwhile, but there's certainly a bit of overselling the narrative here.",Negative
AMD,Right now? AM5. Upgradability is really a blown out or proprtion thing. Less than 1% of ethusiasts (let alone average users) will ever replace a CPU on same platform. By the time people upgrade they will buy a new socket.,Negative
AMD,"Sell on eBay? No thanks. Too easy to get scammed. Cash in hand only.   Also, and I swear this is unrelated to my distaste for selling personal items on eBay, the last time I tried to sell something on eBay they banned my account. No warning, no nothing. The account that was over 15 years old, but had only purchased items. An item I took my own pictures for, wrote all the descriptions for. Nothing copy/pasted into the item listing.   Never could get that account reopened, and I had to use a fake name and address to open a new account to even so much as purchase with. They blacklisted ME, the person.",Negative
AMD,You're just making stuff up now. You really didn't want to do all that stuff a year ago when RAM was cheap?,Negative

AMD,My usb ports are fine. I use ethernet so no wifi card is installed.,Positive
AMD,"AM5 is significantly more expensive, both motheboards and CPUs. Its more performant yes. But I'm not asking for what is the most performant platform today is. I'm asking what other platform in history provided better value over time than AM4. Upgradability is important to me.",Negative

AMD,am confused. this is battlemage too right? because its a B series. but its supposed to be all new. and the old gen was battlemage too on the 200V series. so what is going on here?. is this just a bigger GPU or is this Xe3 so that would be Celestial.,Neutral

AMD,"Even if that claim were overstated by 2x, would still be a colossal L for amd.",Negative
AMD,Xps is a huge seller for Dell and they are straight up using Panther Lake and XE3. They are exclusively going intel. Intel is 100% securing up there dominance in Labtops. In the process also taking business away from Nvidia.,Positive
AMD,I hesitate to trust Intel's charts. But I am interested if Intel will actually get companies to adopt panther lake for their handheld pc. They did not have much luck with lunar lake.,Negative
AMD,"Assuming intel also keeps those mobile CPUs a good price, this could be really good. Hopefully as well they add the B390 in their high power desktop CPUs, seeing a core ultra 5 with an iGPU like this would really mitigate the need for a dedicated GPU right away Mostly because iGPUs on other generations were bad, and only a select few Ryzen CPUs had the 890M. Budget systems could become much better for gaming on the low side for graphical intensive games",Positive

AMD,"This ain't gonna matter. It's the sku with 50% more igpu cores compared to lunarlake, which already has an igpu that's larger than the hx 370, it's real expensive. Imagine a hx370 with 26cu instead of 16, that's the price range you're lookin at  Any system built with this is gonna need to run at extremely high mem speed to feed the really large igpu which in the current market with insane ram prices is gonna be priced out of most people's budget. Are ya prepared for a gaming handheld that costs north of $1500?  And since this is gonna compete against nvidia's entry level mobile gpus oems are gonna have to choose between nvidia and intel for the gaming brand on laptops.

AMD,No?  People will still value AMD more ue to brand so Intel will have to rely on volume for revenue  For reference only yesterday on this sub we had people talking about Intel lacking efficiency in comparison in mobile space,Neutral
AMD,Crazy AMD haven't updated their iGPU to RDNA 4. I know they're probably waiting for UDNA but it would have been almost 3 years on the same architecture by the time we get the UDNA refresh next year (if they even bring it to their APUs right away). Sort of disappointing.,Negative
AMD,"tbf the most important issue is, few games implemented XeSS, just like AMD FSR.  And I think XeSS 3 being implemented in more games is a net positive for AMD GPU too.",Positive
AMD,"With everything happening around NVIDIA´s price increases and AMD´s lack of providing updates where it hurts, it **feels like** AI-Datacenters are more important right now for them (like the last 2 years).  But who can resent them as Intel had products that where not so much competitive that time.    Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.   Now let them release a B770 that is rumoured to be fairly mid/high range and we can hope for competition that actually learned from bad products recently and tries to make it better.",Neutral

AMD,"It may not beat LNL in very low power envelopes (LNL was designed for ~10W, PTL for 15W+), but it's a much, much better baseline than what Intel's historically had in client. Even just extending vaguely LNL-tier efficiency across the stack is a very big deal. Looks like Intel finally has a respectable SoC architecture.

AMD,"Battlemage is the brand name. The actual architecture of Lunar Lake is Xe2, same as desktop Battlemage, but they never explicitly called it Battlemage, only “Arc Graphics”.  What is meant to be desktop Celestial is Xe3P, but desktop Celestial is likely cancelled or significantly scaled back.

AMD,What do you mean that a refreshed Strix Point can’t compete with an updated architecture?,Neutral
AMD,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
AMD,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.  I don't understand why AMD decided to price Strix Point and Strix Halo so ridiculously -- it's their market for the taking.",Neutral
AMD,I think they’re trying to take away business from Qualcomm/arm on windows before it takes off,Neutral
AMD,Intel charts for their gpus have been pretty on point   Msi claw with lunar lake is one of the best handhelds,Positive
AMD,"Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds, Intel just didn't have anything else so they slapped that on the MSI Claw. Now the options should be much better considering they are selling a lower core Xe3 version for cheap too",Negative
AMD,"I'm just curious how they handle the need for such high speed RAM on desktop though? I guess this is an application where CAMM2 will be required, I don't think DDR5-9600+ is possible without it and this is presumably pretty key to the performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It certainly would make a huge difference because iGPUs are very memory bandwidth bound; and as the name suggests, LPDDR5 9600 has literally twice the bandwidth of the JEDEC standard 4800.  Unfortunately I doubt we'll see reasonably priced laptops with LPDDR5 9600 -- even as an add-on option. I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800; and many SKUs that were 2x16GB are now 1x16GB; yes **single channel**.... they charge you extra if you want 2x8GB.",Neutral

AMD,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
AMD,Example?,Neutral
AMD,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from. In another graph featuring supposedly ""native"" 1080p, they claimed Arc B390 was 82% faster than the HX 370 (why don't they just call it Radeon 890M though...)",Neutral
AMD,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral
AMD,"If it was only a 73% gain *including* MFG, then that would be a serious performance regression. If they were using MFG in their graphs, it would easily be 200% - 300% ""faster"" at the same ""real"" performance",Negative
AMD,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
AMD,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral
AMD,"There are 50% more GPU cores here than on Lunar or Arrow Lake. CPU is still 16 cores as well compared to Arrow Lake, just shifted from 6+8+2 to 4+8+4.",Neutral
AMD,"Do you mean Strix Halo?  Halo is made up of THREE dies. Two are regular CCD and one is a ~300mm2 graphics die. Total die area is around 440mm2 IIRC.  It's expensive, but not THAT expensive.",Neutral
AMD,Doesn't this depend on use case? AMD laptops are more capable for gaming and the iGPU can also use the lesser version of FSR. Intel is obv better for productivity.,Positive
AMD,"I disagree, Arrow lake HX seems to be more expensive than AMD HX as least on Lenovo Legion Pro setup.   I would have buy Arrow lake for the same price but AMD is cheaper by $200.",Negative

AMD,"Lmao check the data, Intel has 79% of the laptop market share currently",Neutral
AMD,"Reddit isn’t indicative of anything really, most casual laptop buyers don’t even know what AMD is.",Negative
AMD,"I wouldn't be surprised if this is because the team has chosen to focus efforts on UDNA because that's the architecture next-gen consoles would use.

AMD,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
AMD,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.  Ampere (crypto bubble ignoring) was priced well and many excellent cards in there since it was on Samsung, a cheap fab; while DC/workstation chips got TSMC.",Neutral
AMD,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
AMD,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient.

AMD,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
AMD,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.  I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
AMD,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
AMD,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
AMD,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
AMD,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
AMD,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
AMD,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
AMD,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
AMD,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
AMD,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
AMD,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
AMD,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
AMD,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
AMD,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive

AMD,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too.

AMD,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds. Something like the Radeon 890M have done fine with such speeds",Neutral

AMD,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral

AMD,"Ice lake, Alder lake, Metor Lake",Neutral
AMD,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
AMD,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
AMD,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

AMD,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral
AMD,"> Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core   There are SoC and platform level targets that depend on a lot more than just clock speed for the same cores.

But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

I'll also link the scheduling patent here in case anyone reading this thread is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2)   It sounds like gains in workgraphs scenarios will be be even greater.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
AMD,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative

AMD,"It's a huge amount of people.  At work, we have so many of these little databoxes that we plug into a monitor and keyboard. Small, portable, gets the job done, easy to replace and fit in all situations.  These would be a very nice drop-in replacement for those. These aren't designed for individual buyers, though they certainly won't mind the sales. It's more targeting corporate deployments where a company will want to buy hundreds to thousands or more, have them easily stored in a warehouse that can quickly be deployed when needed. When a computer for work breaks, I let my project manager know and they'll contact logistics to organize a swap, happened a few times last year and recently just had to swap a computer out due to a broken power button. These are super convenient for such cases, especially with office work where they take way more abuse as they remove the fragile screen + hinge on laptops if they're gonna be used in a situation where nobody cares about them.  My main concern is the keyboard. In office, keyboard and mouse are replaced all the time, so having one tied to the rest of the hardware is problematic. Companies often favour buying the cheapest en-masse and replace when broken, as hiring someone to fix expensive stuff that nobody cares about is not cost efficient. Yes you can just plug a new keyboard in, but I do have a bit of e-waste concern if some companies simply decide to throw them out due to speed/efficiency, kinda like how mostly fine laptops that have some broken bits are sadly discarded all the time by companies.  Then again, throwing away this is less wasteful and cost efficient than throwing away a laptop, so maybe it's still net better.",Positive
AMD,The laptop screen is definitely useful once you have to go into a conference room. The cost savings might be pretty marginal given the economies of scale for laptops,Positive
AMD,"This is aimed at businesses. Nobody buying these new will be interested in modding to that extent.   Not to mention that if you're going to replace the only thing that makes this PC special, there's no reason to start with it. Just grab any laptop motherboard or a mini PC",Negative

For Nvidia, it’s because they do yearly GPU releases, but their other components typically are kept and used for multiple years.  This just happens to be the year that “everything” in their system is going new.  Next year Nvidia will keep everything but the GPUs.

The only area where the 1800X shined was clock speed and even then it basically capped at like 4.0-4.1 GHz on golden samples. You were just better off buying a 1700X and OC'ing it to 1800X clock speed and pocketing the difference or spending it on more RAM or something else.  Notice how AMD basically doesn't allow for a slower speed variant with the same cores anymore on the high end like they used to? If you want a 9950X or 9950X3D you have to buy it. Only lower end SKUs like the 9600X will ever see a 9600 or 9500X with similar specs other than clock speeds. AMD might do a refresh of say the 5950X and make a '5950XT' but that's basically just a new stepping and it releases pretty much late into the lifecycle where it makes no sense to wait for it.

AMD,Not when there's no easy way to install an alternate os on an ARM device like with x86.,Neutral

AMD,This guy was talking about the A310 which is a $100 GPU. Basically said that the only other options at that price bracket are either a GT 710 or a GT 1030. And from AMD you can still get an old RX 550. The A310 may be slow but it beats those two gpu's by a mile.,Neutral

AMD,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable. People, like GN, need to temper their overexagerated frustration with a dose of real world perspective and objectivity.",Negative

AMD,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310. Almost anything these days is better than an A310.  >  Like the GT710 make no sense nowadays (their last attempt was what, the GeForce GTX 1630?), even though they sold like hotcakes for offices and for people who just wanted HDMI outs.  GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

AMD,"Id just go with the 5600xt. The 5600x vs 5700x is a ~10fps difference, and with the 5600xt the gap will be even smaller. Plus the included cooler is nice",Positive
AMD,Ryzen 5 5600 is enouph for the 9060xt,Neutral

AMD,thinking of upgrading to 9060xt from 2060. What is your opinion on the card? I play on 1080p online FPS and 2K for single players,Neutral
AMD,This makes no sense,Negative
AMD,Its amazing. You can run 1440p on any multiplayer and single player game,Positive
AMD,Are you going to elaborate on why or just be contrarian? I have a 5600x and 9060xt at 1440p and some games I’m definitely bottlenecked by my cpu. So I suggest to this person they should potentially get a better cpu than the one I run if they’re playing games that are more intensive.  OP didn’t give much info in their post on what they play/are wanting out of their system so I gave a very broad response. Either say something of substance or do everyone a favor and bow out,Negative
AMD,"the difference between both those CPUs is \~1-5fps on average (with a 4090)   [https://youtu.be/7L9rPNSuPCA?si=L2PQZBG4hUkUk2kf&t=409](https://youtu.be/7L9rPNSuPCA?si=L2PQZBG4hUkUk2kf&t=409)  a 1.440p resolution would be more taxing on the GPU.   makes no sense to get the 5700 because of the higher resolution.   but overall, the 5600 is just as good",Neutral
AMD,No,Neutral
AMD,"For web dev, I’m not sure. Feel like a 5800 XT might be plenty for that  For gaming, with your GPU and depending what resolution and settings you use, most likely not worth it",Neutral
AMD,no upgrade your GPU,Neutral
AMD,I did a similar upgrade and I love it. Id do it again for sure.,Positive
AMD,"I think it's a worthy upgrade, and you're getting a more efficient TDP of 65W  I plan to upgrade from a 5600x to a 9700x when RAM prices hopefully return to normal",Positive
AMD,"Performance wise now , no. But will it be cheaper to switch platforms in future ? I went to 7945HX , no real world difference that you would notice from day to day  , 9700x is a bit faster on single thread tasks than my HX and it's better chip overall looking at it.  5800x/XT is a bit too hot chip , i was always annoyed by cooler trying to cool it , HX rocks in that area one of the reason i changed the dam thing ( plus they sell like crazy now ) .",Neutral
AMD,Where did u get ram?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I think is worth. I have never experienced such upgrade but in theory there should be an improvement, just the fact that the PCIe would match in the motherboard + CPU + GPU. With such GPU, you could squeeze all it's juice.",Positive
AMD,The 5800xt is a hauss and will only “limit” your fps at 1080p 300+fps. 2k & 4k will both be gpu bound,Negative
AMD,"Flip the DDR5 ram, sell the 5060 Ti and get a 5070 Ti or 5080 if you game at 1440p. Your 5800XT is plenty for webdev, will not bottleneck the new GPU and you will get more value and impact for longer from a higher tier GPU.",Neutral
AMD,"The 9700x is in no man's land. It doesn't perform much better than a 9600x in gaming. Production work loads, sure.  But it's really not that much more for a 7800x3d. Like $80.  7800x3d is far superior in gaming and only a slight reduction in production loads from 9700x.",Negative
AMD,Upgrading a 5060 TI 16GB to play Deadlock is insanity,Negative
AMD,The 5800X/XT can be undervolted down to the 60s-70sW range and basically turn into a 65W TDP 5700X.,Neutral
AMD,I'm afraid that 9700x will be obsolete by then or you will have other worries ...,Negative
AMD,"Bought it off FB Marketplace from a sketchy seller. He blocked me right after pickup, and I later found one stick was broken. Luckily, Corsair approved a free RMA (I was fully expecting to pay) and sent me a brand-new kit.",Negative
AMD,Good advise. Side tangent: I hate the flipping economy. Its one of the many reasons everything is so damn expensive.,Negative
AMD,great point about the 7800x3d. Might look into upgrading to that instead if I do decide to upgrade.,Positive
AMD,This guy is clue less. It isn't far superior in gaming. You can tweak the 9700X to be on par if not faster across a wide selection of games. A tweaked 9700X is not that much slower on \*average\* than a 7800X3D. Also it would make more sense for you to upgrade your GPU at this point.,Negative
AMD,"Congrats, lucky you)",Positive
AMD,"7800x3D would be a meaningful upgrade. Its genuinely a great CPU, and has some great gains in games that make use of the 3D vcache like simulation games. But I wouldn't spend money just for the sake of spending money, especially since if you upgrade the CPU you'd also have to get a new GPU to really see any difference.",Positive
AMD,"I'm also looking at a 7900X. Do you think getting a 7900X now is more worthwhile since it offers a bigger upgrade path for the future (in a couple of years), like eventually moving to a 9900X3D and a better GPU?",Positive
AMD,"Frankly no, you're saving like $60 at most if youre in the US market. I also made this debate before upgrading to my 7800x3D. Unless the software you use to web dev scales with more cores and doesnt care about CCD-to-CCD latency I don't see a reason to go with the 7900X. Also in gaming its strictly worse (but not bad) than a 7800x3D.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m in Canada, so it’s only a CA$80 difference between the 7900X and 7800X3D. But I also found a deal for a 9700X, and the difference between that and the 7800X3D would be CA$160.",Neutral
AMD,"hmm I see. 160 is quite a lot honestly, that makes a big difference then. I'd say its worth going with the 9700X BUT just keep in mind that you won't see an immediate performance gain in gaming unless you also get a better GPU. X3D CPUs are the best for gaming, but something like the 9700X is no slouch.  I should have asked this first though: What resolution do you play at and what's your monitor's refresh rate?",Positive
AMD,"In gaming 7900x is more or less equal to 9700x. More cores does nothing there. So like the other guy said, unless your applications scale with more cores, you're really not gaining anything. You also lose a bit in power efficiency",Negative
AMD,"1440p 180hz though I mostly play very CPU heavy games like Deadlock, Dota 2, and simulation games.",Neutral
AMD,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWo\_ahBTrU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNWo_ahBTrU)  Stop lying to him. It just takes 3 seconds to look into this. This is also at stock and the 9700X benefits more from unlocking it's power limits and tuning the memory.,Negative
AMD,"If you're looking to max your FPS to match the monitor's refresh rate and you're willing to upgrade your GPU down the line the 9700X would be a reasonable upgrade. Simulation games will probably see the most benefit from the upgrade. And your 1% and 0.1% lows will probably see a boost as well, making games feel smoother. Just keep expectations in check, not everything will improve.  Also sidenote, the 5800XT you have now is not a bad CPU by any means and matches the 5060 TI quite well. If I were you I'd sleep on it and see if you really want to spend the money.",Positive

With that in-mind, I'd do this build, as it will set you up for adding basically any graphics card you want (excluding maybe a 5090) later, and it will be able to handle the power draw of basically any AM5 CPU, including a 9950X.

AMD,"Honestly a 7600x system isn't impossible for that price, but I would probably advise to go for a DDR4 AM4 system instead to leave more budget for a GPU.   Something like a 5600x with a 5060/9060xt would net you way better gaming performance over a 7600x and an older GPU. The downside being there isn't really any upgrade path past the 5600x going that route.  With the way pricing is right now and having that budget, you kind of need to decide do I want more performance in games today, or an easier upgrade path 3-5 years from now.",Neutral
AMD,"First of all, thank you for your reply, and your configuration is interesting, but the problem is that according to chat gpt, the processor is ONLY compatible with DDR5, so I don't know if he's talking nonsense or if he's actually right. I don't know what to think.",Negative
AMD,"No it is correct, the 7600x is only for DDR5, I was saying to go with the older generation 5600x or similar that would work with DDR4.   The money saved on the AM4 CPU, DDR4 ram and motherboard could go towards a far faster GPU and would be a way better overall gaming machine.   Sure the 7600x is a better CPU, but going for the 5600x would be a far more balance system. If you could strtch your budget closer to $1000 or so then I think going for a DDR5 system would be a fair use of your budget.",Neutral

AMD,7800X3D with either 9070XT or 5070ti imo. 5080 is way too expensive for not enough performance increase,Negative
AMD,"Currently, the hardware sweetspot is 1440p gaming on a 27"" monitor.  Monitor should be OLED, which is highly recommended.  This would be my take:   \- storage: 2 TB M.2 SSD (do not take 1 TB cause it will not be enough for games, 2 TB is truly great. Also 2 x 1 TB is not really recommended either)  \- GPU: Radeon RX 9070 XT, which is the best bang for what it offers now.  \- 850W Gold or Platinum PSU, at least ATX 3.0 supported  Now, CPU is a great question. You could either go with:  \- Ryzen 7 7800x3d  \- 2x16GB (32 GB) DDR5 6000 MHz Cl30 ram (note that e.g. a CL38 latency often performs worse than DDR4)   Or:  \- Intel CPU, it the following strength order: 12600KF < 14500 < 12700KF < 14600KF < 14700KF  \- 2x16GB (32 GB) DDR4 3600 MHz Cl18 ram  Motherboard can be a lot nice to be found, also PC case as you wish.  Regarding CPU cooler just take any dual tower cheap cooler, a great idea would be Phantom Spirit 120.  Some notes to take:  \- I would really recommend to buy your stuff as soon as possible, GPU and SSD prices might be skyrocketing very soon after RAM prices  \- do NOT buy only 16 GB (DDR4-5) RAM, it is not enough  \- non X3D AMD CPU-s do not really worth it. In that case, just go for Intel, which also has DDR4 support for great budget saving.  \- follow this guy, he has great comments: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1psnsbg/comment/nvazhh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",Positive

AMD,A 9060XT is very different from a 9070XT (like in your original post). The 9070XT is almost 70% faster and double the price. They’re not cards in the same class.,Neutral
AMD,Clarity: Does build A  have a 90**60**xt or 90**70**XT? Big difference.,Neutral
AMD,"Option A all the way, spend the 40€ more to get the 7500x3D.   Option B is bad because: * DDR4 is holding back the i5-14400, something like 15-20% performance loss depending on the game. * Gigabyte H610M is a **very** budget motherboard, doesn't even have a heatsink on the VRMs.",Negative
AMD,"You’re right, I confused it with another build. I replied with the correct one to u/JadeArgonar :)",Neutral
AMD,"Shoot sorry I confused it with another build hahah. Here’s the actual Option A : ~1800€  - AMD Ryzen 5 7500F, 6x 3.70GHz - 32GB DDR5 RAM 6000 MHz Kingston - AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT - 16GB - MSI Pro A620AM-B Evo - 2000 GB M.2 SSD",Neutral
AMD,"DDR4 is slower, but you can also save like €200+. The difference is less than 10% in some games but closer to 20%+ in others, kinda depends what you’re playing.   On the other hand, the 5070 is 30% faster than the 9060XT (assuming that wasn’t a typo), closer to 50% with RT and also has DLSS 4.5 which looks better than FSR Quality even on performance mode. And I say this as someone who has an AMD GPU and loves it.   You’re right that the Gigabyte H610m is a bad mobo. For the same price of around 90€ you can get an ASUS b760m ayw wifi d4 ii, which is a fantastic budget mobo and would push my recommendation toward option B, unless you really want the AM5 upgrade path.",Neutral
AMD,If it has a 9700xt. A with x3d no questions asked.,Neutral
AMD,"If the extra doesn't put you out of budget I'd say it's worth it. The 9070XT is significantly stronger than either of the other builds, DDR5 is nice to have, and   the extra VRAM is good for longevity in particular once you upgrade your monitor.  Though one note this and the 5070 option both have budget motherboards.",Positive
AMD,"Ah, if it’s a 9070XT then definitely go for option A, no contest there.   I’d shop around for prices a bit though, I just built a new PC with a 9070xt and 14600kf a couple weeks ago and paid under 1200€ for everything.   Prices I paid (in $CAD) were: $899 - ASUS Prime RX 9070XT  $269 - 14600kf $139 - ASUS b760m ayw wifi d4 ii  $259 - 32gb crucial ddr4  $140 - be quiet 850W 80+ Gold PSU $89 - MSI A13 240 AIO  $99 - HYXN H1 Case   Total was $1894 CAD which is 1170€. I already had an nvme to spare but assuming you spend 200€ to get a nice ssd, that would still be over 400€ cheaper than build A. Even if you splurged on a 4TB 990 Pro and paid someone to put the thing together, you’d still have plenty left over.   Now, regional pricing does vary from Canada to Europe, but I just bought most of these parts online from amazon and newegg at MSRP ish, so I’d imagine it’s not impossible to find similar prices even if they aren’t for the exact same parts.

AMD,"I take your point on matched ram sticks (that's why I got 2 x 16gb for my build 5 years ago), but with the current RAM prices and a budget build, you would be better off buying 2 X 8gb now and upgrading to 2 x 16gb in a few years when prices are hopefully a lot lower.  In terms of whether 16gb is enough for gaming, hardware unboxed did a comparison recently of 8 Vs 16 vs 32 GB gaming. Conclusion was 16gb is perfectly fine for 95% of games, which was a little surprising to me but can't argue with the data.   So those on a budget can definitely hold off on 32gb for a few years. Unless they want to play current and future triple A titles, but then they shouldn't be doing a budget build. Better to put the savings into a video card with more than 8gb VRAM and then upgrade RAM in 2-3 years. Because you can upgrade your system ram easily but not the VRAM.",Neutral

A minimum, I think it's something that everyone who is budget restricted should give a shot; especially if you're more of a patient gamer. For me, a 5700XT to a 4070 Ti Super felt like a brand new computer that didn't really need anything else.   In my case, I never actually naturally encountered a title that my 3600 couldn't run that I really wanted to play. Sure I saw some in benchmarks showing that some titles experienced sub-70FPS, but seeing it is different than actually encountering it in my natural course of gaming. Plus.. it's pretty much the same as seeing a title on PS5 or Switch that interests me, but I'll probably never play because I don't have a PS5 or Switch.  Sure some titles would also perform better than my 3600 could when paired with a 4070 Ti Super, but for the most part 90FPS or higher feels fine to me and I only have a 144hz 1440p monitor that I can't really tell the difference at between 110FPS and 144FPS. DLSS feels perfect fine and really carries the 3600 pretty far.   In all honesty, Hell Let Loose was the only title that I ever really naturally encountered that made the 3600 feel a bit tired, but by all means it was playable.   I did eventually move on to first a 5600 and then a 7600x, but that was more of a no-brainer financial decision. I found super good prices on both when prices were good ($110 on the CPU/mobo/RAM side of things after selling my old mobo/RAM/CPU). In all honesty, I couldn't personally say I've naturally encountered any game-changing improvements with either the 5600 or 7600x. Again, there definitely are some out there. Especially BF6. But you can stretch a 3600 extremely far and get great results (until you run into something that you flat out can't that's under 60FPS).   I've since played a couple games that my 3600 probably would have struggled with, but in all honesty they were titles I thought were overrated and could have lived without and that was my experience playing them. Had I upgraded from a 3600 to 7600x with the current prices and knew better, I'd probably have pretty bad buyers remorse.",Neutral

In heavy multi-core workloads, yes, the 14600KF will beat it, but that's not really most productivity applications, just some very *specific* ones. The most common one pointed towards being video encoding, but most people are going to want to use the GPU to do that which is going to be several orders of magnitude faster. CPU video encoding is only necessary for extremely high quality & bit rate encoding or if you need to encode into video formats that the GPU encoder doesn't support. It's mostly used as a CPU benchmarking tool because it's one of the few semi-real world use cases that stress out a multi core CPU, not because it's something people will actually do very often.

AMD,Im using a 9800x3d with no issues. I think if we go by your own criteria and future proofing comment you will be better served with the 9800x3d.,Neutral
AMD,"Thank you for the feedback everyone, I think im set in getting the 9800x3d, even though there are underlying issues, there should be workarounds for it and the price points for 7800x3d and 9800x3d isn't far off in my country with just $70 dollars difference.",Positive
AMD,"7800X3D is an amazing chip for gaming. Terrible for productivity tasks.  9800Z3D is slightly better than the 7800X3D for gaming, and quite a bit better for productivity, but still far worse than non-X3D chips.  The 9950X3D is the best option if you want both, it's like top 5 productivity CPUs but it requires more tinkering with the dual CCDs to make work.  7800X3D is the better value to performance. 9800X3D is better   9950X3D is silly but great and more expensive",Negative

AMD,"yeah the 7800x3d has set its foundation to be a solid cpu now and thats what im considering, but the 9800x3d is fairly new, even with the issues currently I have high hopes that the new optimization updates for it would stand to be a more solid cpu in the future.  Also on my country, both cpus are actually just near its price points with just $70 higher on 9800x3d than the 7800x3d so I guess 9800x3d would suffice for me.",Positive
AMD,It's kinda misleading to say the 7800X3D is terrible for productivity just because it's not the absolute best you can buy.  It's an incredibly fast 8-core CPU and would work great for both gaming and productivity.,Positive
AMD,would you say pairing the 9950x3d with a 5060 ti works just the same? I mean 5-10% performance increase in the cpu is kinda not bad considering price differences,Neutral

AMD,"If Zen 7 is on AM5 as is rumored, then that makes sense (if you don’t want the performance of Zen 6), since 5 years from now is probably close to Zen 8 release on AM6 (+ DDR6). You’d be upgrading to the last, best, that AM5 would offer.  If the rumors aren’t true, and Zen 7 is on AM6 instead, that would happen much sooner (2029?), and you would actually lose out on the ability to get Zen 6 X3D if you wait to 2031 like you’re talking, for the same reason that AM4 owners can’t get a 5800X3D/5700X3D at any sane price.   All I’m really suggesting is to upgrade your CPU when you want the extra performance or other features on offer, and not to wait for an arbitrary time, just as you already plan to do with your GPU. I personally think you’ll choose to upgrade to Zen 6 X3D next year, bc the CPU will be such a beast (if the rumors are true), but ofc we all must wait and see how things develop :) .. that’s my next upgrade, anyway, and I use a 12700K now.",Neutral
AMD,"Well that's a small price difference, but in Europe for some reason it's near 50% difference for about 7 to10% gains and maybe a bit better 1% lows if you don't blink a lot. Still, its your call but just do a small research about ASRock motherboards and what you should expect or do if you choose X or Y mobo when installing the chip. You will not be ""screwed"" with either of those chips.",Neutral

The 7800X3D is not incredibly fast, it's just powerful....for gaming. The x3D chips specifically give up speed for a bigger L3 cache.",Negative
AMD,"no it really isnt that great at most productivity tasks as most workloads often affect the entirety of the CPU causing temps to be the main limitation, for light productivity sure its not bad at all but for anyone who is serious about productivity its a bad call, where as the redesign of the 9800x3d and having the cache below the CCD allows it to run at higher frequencies and for longer sustained boosts making it surprisingly capable compared to its high core count counterparts especially in photoshop",Negative
AMD,"sadly my budget would go overboard if I went with the 9950x3d, I would much rather go with either of the two and pay the extra for a better gpu to pair with",Negative
AMD,"A 9950X3D with a 5060Ti is fairly imbalanced. But, depending on what you're using it for vs budget it's not necessarily bad. Like if you value the 16GB version for VRAM and just doing like video editing where the VRAM is more important than the clock speeds, and your gaming is limited to basic needs and you want to save a few hundred? Sure.",Neutral
AMD,may I ask what kind of productivity do you mention here?,Neutral
AMD,"Productivity is a general term for things like complying code, editing videos, 3D modeling, etc. basically things that that CPU cycles and time to process that aren't games. ""Thinking"" tasks. That's a broad generalization",Neutral

AMD,If you already have an old pc with the intel cpu why are you buying another motherboard? Just put the gpu in that build and you’re good to go.   14600k is a pretty good cpu for gaming you probably won’t have any issues with the 5070. Only if you play crazily cpu intensive games like Tarkov will you see a significant difference with an AMD x3d chip in most cases.

AMD,"This is such a weird post tbh.   You already have a working pc with a working LGA 1700 mobo just because you got a gen 5 NVME doesn’t mean you need an entire new platform.

AMD,"Then it's up to you, but get a cheaper board regardless lol.  I think if I were you, I'd buy a used 7800x3d for $300(I see one right now on ebay), get a $150 am5 board with pcie 5, then sell the 14600k on ebay for $240.  The 7800x3d is not only a really fast CPU, but it is also less affected by your slow 5200 ram due to the large vcache. You could spend the extra $100 for a used 9800x3d if you want.",Neutral
AMD,"Unless you have money to burn, it is perfectly fine for gaming. Do you know the model?  Gen 5 m.2 is basically useless for gaming and probably won’t matter for a while. Unless you really need gen 5 for a specific use case but gen4 and even gen3 ssds are still very fast.  Just make sure your power supply can handle the 5070 (>650w is ideal) and it has the proper connections for it(12vhpwr 12 pin) and I see no issues with it",Neutral
AMD,Micro Center has $680 bundles that include 6000 RAM,Neutral

AMD,"In that case, go with AM5... B650E boards are like $140-$150, comes with pcie 5 nvme, and has PCIE gen 5 primary slot.  Some b850 boards are also like this, but they are only guaranteed to have nvme pcie gen 5, not the primary slot. So you'd need to do a quick google on the b850 boards to check.  I'm sure there are cheaper LGA1700 boards with pcie gen 5, but I don't know how they're labeled.",Neutral
AMD,"Don't need to get an expensive AM5 board to get pcie gen 5. Lots of great options like B850's that support gen5.

AMD,"Money not that issue, kind my worry now is if I stick with lga 1700 not that much options for cpu update in the future. With amd it's the newest one and kinda no need to buy new cpu or motherboard for a while. I5 14600k is good but not better than 9800x3d. I see bundle of AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D + TUF Gaming X870-PLUS WiFi for $680",Neutral
AMD,"In that case I’d just replace the gpu. Save the money or consider moving it into a better gpu like the 9070xt for an even better gaming experience (more vram, higher frames etc.)  That’s a pretty high wattage psu in that pc, does it have a gpu in it already?",Positive
AMD,"Yeah but it’s not like you are investing more money into the lga1700 system, you already have it.  You also don’t gain anything by moving to am5 right now, if you wanted to switch later and get a newer x3d chip you would just shift the buying of the motherboard to then. You already have the ddr5 which is the hard part.  I’m not seeing the logic unless you really want the x3d right now. I don’t really see the value in replacing such a recent and high performing cpu.  At the very least you could try out the pc with the gpu and decide if you really need to upgrade the cpu. Does that computer have a gpu already? I’d be wary of spending lots of money for minor improvements.",Negative
AMD,"Not yet, planning to get rtx 5070 16gb this month.",Neutral

AMD,"Put the 680$ for the amd platform upgrade towards a higher tier gpu and keep the 14600k, don’t buy a 12gb card in 2026. Find a 5080 for msrp before it’s too late!",Neutral
AMD,"Do you think it worth it to go to 5080, or wait for a new GPU release",Neutral
AMD,5080 gives not much performance increase at a pretty big premium. Wouldn’t really recommend it’s not a very sensible choice imo.  Probably not a good idea to wait on the gpu.. if you want one get it now. Prices are going up and may not come down for a while.

The 9800X3D also draws significantly less power and creating significantly less heat than the 14700.  If you're doing cpu heavy professional work the 14700 can make sense because of how many cores it has, but for gaming, not even close.",Positive
AMD,There's nothing to be skeptical about. The 9800X3D is a no-brainer. I prefer Nvidia over AMD when it comes to GPUs though. DLSS is crazy good.,Positive
AMD,"The X3D processors are the best indeed. But since you are not getting a 2000$ GPU, the difference in video game performance will only matter in certain niches (e.g. Hearts of Iron, competitive games on a 480Hz screen).   Your current PC looks fine. Switch out the GPU if you are unhappy with AAA performance. I assume you could even slap that 14700f on your current board should the i5 turn out to be an actual issue with anything you play.",Positive
AMD,"In addition to all the other reasons the 9800x3d is the better option, one other is that it is on AMD's newest socket that is going to be supported through 2027 (and likely longer), where the 14700f is on a mostly dead Intel socket.  So even if things start to feel a bit sluggish after 4-5 years, you will have a much easier time finding a CPU upgrade for the AMD option, if you choose to upgrade a couple of parts rather than the entire system.",Positive

AMD,Lol ok,Positive
AMD,"Yeah, a few games do scale to multi CCX though (particularly when you have RAM and FCLK OC). With double vcache it would probably happen more significantly and more often than scaling onto a second standard CCD. Satisfactory for example runs 7% faster enabling second CCD on a 9950x3d with RAM OC and 2200 FCLK. It also often helps loading times, and basically cuts shader compilation time (and stutter) in half.  With zen 5 fixing the voltage tolerance issue, vcache CCD's are also significantly faster and more efficient than standard ones for productivity. They're basically just a better version of the CCD.  A big part of the issue with 3900x was that it had 3 core CCX's, while the 3800x etc had 4 core CCX's. The amount of cores in a CCX is really important, and 3 cores vs 4 cores affected so many games. A 9800x3d and 9950x3d both have 8 core CCX's (so it's not taking a major downgrade there), the latter just has a second one available too.",Neutral
AMD,"1. Not everyone is a gamer. Dual 3D cache slab might well make greater difference in many applications.    2. Extra cache slice is NOT much more expensive. Maybe $20-30 per slice. Yes, AMD charges arm&leg for it, but that's only because they can.",Neutral

AMD,It’s not a few games. It’s a specific genre of games. It’s those simulation games like city skyline 2. Those games runs faster on a EPYC than a 9800x3d so you get the idea.  Having 2 CCD both with Vcache is not a great idea for games.,Negative
AMD,"The higher clocked non cache CCD makes more sense for non gaming applications on the 9950X3D.  And you still forget the fact of that the latency between the CCD’s is still a major problem that is going to be fixed starting at Zen 6 and not Zen 5. This means that in gaming you still have to limit the CPU to a single CCD so that means zero improvement in gaming.   When looking at workstation tasks, AMD has Threadripper which is what takes up that section of the market.   This means a dual CCD other than for testing purposes and engineering prototypes makes no sense.   And the argument that it is faster in benchmarks than the 9950X3D has also been debunked already.  All that and the extra costs it would be to make it and setting the price to sell at makes it not worth it for AMD.   Conclusion: 9950X3D2 is never going to be released to consumers.",Negative
AMD,"> The higher clocked non cache CCD makes more sense for non gaming applications on the 9950X3D.  The non cache CCD's clock 2% higher, but vcache usually has at least a 4%+ IPC gain in productivity tasks (sometimes over +25%) on zen 5 and wins easily. It's rare to find anything that the standard CCD can match a vcache CCD in.  That used to be the case on Zen 3 and 4, but Zen 5 both scales more from vcache (in terms of IPC gain) and it no longer has a -220mv voltage restriction since they redesigned the vcache.  Looking at this kind of data, why would you pick the Standard CCD on purpose? Ignore all the games if you want, it's still just better across the board despite the 100mhz clock drop. https://files.catbox.moe/iy5ygj.png  > This means that in gaming you still have to limit the CPU to a single CCD so that means zero improvement in gaming.   It depends on the game, there are a few (e.g. Satisfactory and Riftbreaker) which see significant performance advantages from 2ccd on 9950x3d already - even though the second CCD is weaker, without vcache - which makes it the best CPU for those games. That is particularly the case when using RAM and FCLK OC's. My 2ccd perf on Satisfactory is ~7% higher than second place on the leaderboard because of this scaling.  It's also commonplace to see significant reductions in load time with multi-CCX, and having two CCX's basically cuts shader compilation time and shader compilation stutter in half.",Neutral
AMD,All you said is pure speculation and hopeful thoughts. AMD during the 9950X3D release said that a dual cache CCD is not economically viable and with practically no improvements to performance. I take AMD’s words over yours in this case.  It makes no sense for a dual cache CCD in Zen 5 while it will still suffer from latency between the CCD’s. That is not speculation that is a fact.   It looks more like AMD is testing for a dual CCD Zen 6 release which makes more sense because of the latency issues they are resolving in Zen 6.  And if AMD were to actually release a 9950X3D2 then they would have announced it at CES which they did not further proving that it is just an engineering prototype.,Negative

I had to wait a good long time to buy my 9070 XT (XFX Swift Tri-fan) at close to the MSRP--still paid $141 over the $599 MSRP, so I hope AMD will return to the practice of selling its own reference designs, again, so that its customers can purchase them immediately upon availability. I love this 9070 XT--it's super, a beautiful GPU in every respect. But I would prefer not having to wait 6-8 months after RDNA5 ships to buy it at MSRP.

AMD,IMO amd needs to set up a registered gamers list people can register on. And allow them to buy GPUs at MSRP during trying times . . . AMD also needs to work with memory suppliers and others to make sure their supply chain has the capacity to meet the demand of the registry.  would be a huge PR win for AMD and a big win for gamers who want a GPU too.

AMD really can't do anything other than encourage their partners to sell at better prices. After AMD sells the chips, their part in the retail channel is very limited without MBA cards competing. And when you have Nvidia selling a direct competitor card at higher prices, guess what AIB manufacturers want to do?  RDNA4's launch was essentially demand pricing. AIB manufacturers took advantage of high demand and once the limited numbers of cards at MSRP were gone, many went to $749 or higher.

AMD,"You make the card you can actually sell to someone. How many people wake up tomorrow and think ""oh yes, a RTX 5090 for $5000 is exactly what I want to buy"".  Memory got more expensive and they have to adjust prices, not discontinue selected products. That's all I said.",Neutral
AMD,Remind me what kind of support the VII and RDNA1 got or the status of FSR4 again?,Neutral
AMD,"> 5 years is a long time....but it seems I've already been forced on that cycle.    If you're buying a 7+ number range not really. I bought my 3080 back in 2021. Then i got my 9070 XT in 2025 which was 4 years of use.    To be honest, i realistically didn't need to upgrade the card as it was still doing fairly well. It was only in 2025 that it was starting to creak with some games - and that could have been compensated for with DLSS performance.    In part thanks to upscaling, the jump in performance between each generation of card isn't really that dramatic. And because most game devs focus their optimisation for consoles and mid-range - a mid-high tier card can last you quite a while.",Neutral
AMD,Called no demand.,Neutral
AMD,"Well said, captured my idea precisely.",Positive
AMD,"Then with all of those variables considered, why not set a reasonable MSRP?  It's not unreasonable to expect an MSRP that is in line with final pricing.",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia sells to business customers, not regular plebs now. That's what i was talking about when i said a card that costs 5k. But it's probably much, much mote expensive than that.",Negative
AMD,They got as much support as they needed.   FSR4 is rightly only officially supported by the cards that can run the full version.,Positive
AMD,"A midrange can last quite awhile, as long as you have enough vram.  A lot of people are going to end up with a card that does not have enough vram between now and the next gen of gpus....over the next 1.5-2yrs. Anyone falling into that trap is going to be on a short upgrade cycle for the next card. Which all works out great for the people selling gpus. They get to sell people into planned obsolescence and blame high ram prices.   I personally was going to buy a 9070xt. But i was not willing to pay over msrp on principal. By 6 months later i just said F it will wait another gen....and stopped looking at stock and prices. In hind sight, now that we know the next gen is delayed a year, and ram prices are going to be shit for a good while....i should have just paid the extra 20% over msrp on launch day for the 9070xt... But, I'm certainly not going to pay 20% over a year later... So, I'm still at F this gen....even tho my 8gb card is starting to annoy me quite a bit now(it was fine, more and more games are not fine, and im currently paying a game that is quite bad on 8gb no matter how low i make the settings). I could easily go buy a 9070xt today; but on sheer principle im not paying over msrp a year into a gpu cycle. I'm a stubborn goat...",Negative
AMD,Mindfactory.de sells out AMD quite easily and they're the largest German retailer. They've had MSRP prices most of the time.    Plenty of demand.,Positive

AMD,> They got as much support as they needed.  As a former VII owner: lol bullshit.   >FSR4 is rightly only officially supported by the cards that can run the full version.  We'll just ignore the int8 version they accidentally released. And we'll ignore how this community has done nothing but whinge about hardware locked functions if it comes from a different company. And ignore the complete lack of fore-thought from RTG as always.,Negative
AMD,"What more did you want? It was based on an outdated architecture from day 1.   The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.",Negative
AMD,"> What more did you want? It was based on an outdated architecture from day 1.  Yes lets excuse a company for a bad product, a lack of investment in software, shit drivers, and lacking support. And zero forward thinking.   Meanwhile the RTX 2080 which released a year earlier for the same price saw a lot longer useful lifespan, feature, and drive support.   And they repeated it again basically pulling the plug on RDNA2 and RDNA3 because they still weren't forward thinking or investing in the right things. But hey it will probably happen to RDNA4 when UDNA rolls around too, so at least they're fair ish in shafting the people that buy their GPUs.   >The community can do what they want with it, but development resources should not be wasted trying to support FSR 4 on RDNA 3, especially if it comes to the detriment of development on RDNA 4 cards.  Given their track record I doubt any further development occurs, especially since their market share is at an all time low. It will probably have a few more promises, be implemented in a few games, and then put out to pasture when their next arch drops.   They'll keep bleeding market share and existing in GPUs just enough to keep anti-trust off Nvidia while still doing the bare minimum.",Negative

AMD,Bro it won’t be significantly better. I think in their keynote they said what 5% ? It was single digits best case scenarios . It’s basically a “KS” sku compared to a “K” sku in terms of intel chips. It will likely be priced higher it IS the best gaming chip.     I suppose you can wait and hope that the current x3d will drop in price  . OR  it could be priced high enough to not cause a price drop on current sku,Negative

Personally I'm just after an efficient lightweight 16 inch laptop with more than 8gb vram and that's ideally not over £2500.

AMD,"All I want from AMD is a balanced APU, a solid CPU and a solid GPU. I genuinely don’t understand this weird obsession companies have with slapping a midrange GPU next to an absurdly overkill CPU. Why can’t we get a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 level CPU paired with something like an 8060S?   Instead, it’s always a top of the lone Ryzen 9 or Intel i9 equivalent paired with what’s basically a midrange GPU. All that does is jack up the cost for no real benefit and push the final price way higher than it needs to be. A 12 core CPU driving a 60 TFLOP GPU is still massive overkill, and it just feels like wasted silicon and money to me.",Negative
AMD,"iGPUs are becoming an exciting field. The Intel ARC B390 is showing itself to be a bloody awesome little iGPU & if this progress continues, I wager my next PC will probably just be a mini PC with an iGPU.",Positive

AMD,IMHO it won't be cheap enough over CPU + dGPU combo - and it's system you can upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"In my experience, the 385 already fits the bill. I got the Framework Desktop mobo, shopped around for deals on the other components, managed to get a sub-4L build for about $1000. Installed Bazzite, logged in to Steam, and was gaming within minutes.  The only lingering flaw - and granted, it IS a pretty major flaw at the moment considering the use case - is that Sleep doesn't work properly and seems to cut power to both USB and the network card even after waking. I'm confident I'll resolve whatever the issue is, but until then, being sure to power down after every session isn't a very difficult thing to do, especially since the only thing I'm using it for is gaming.",Neutral

AMD,Agreed. Although I did buy a 395+ framework desktop 😂,Neutral
AMD,395 isn't meant for most people.,Negative
AMD,I was looking into this and there is a use case you may be missing. This will give you steam machine performance in a 2-3L PC case. Getting a dGPU into something like the MS-A2 (closest comparison I can come up with easily) requires jumping through a ton of hoops and will be more expensive besides.   This has a very niche use case compared to what you suggested and if money is a concern at all your solution is probably better.,Neutral
AMD,You will most likely be able to grab a cheap Chinese mini pc which will beat any cpu + gpu combo in terms of value and size . As a 1080p steam box it would be great heck even the current 870m is decent enough for 1080p gaming . An 8745h machine is like $350 for a fully built system.  I’m not suggesting it’s for everyone but there is definitely a strong use case,Positive

AMD,I guess we wait and see,Neutral
AMD,I've been using an 8700g for the past couple of years and it's fine for 1080p/low gaming but in all these SFF systems it's the GPU that's the bottleneck.  I have no doubt the 8050s is a great improvement on the 780m but I'd still rather have the 8060s,Neutral
AMD,"How many watts does it run at, and how long does a battery charge last?  I'd like to maintain a stable, true 60 FPS for 2-3 hours without it feeling like a turbine.  A low preset would be fine, especially in modern titles like Cyberpunk, Gothic Remake, etc.",Neutral

AMD,Right but at one point they didnt back dlss to the 10 series. They can't. Amd also cant just slap the same fsr on rdna3 without drawbacks. They gotta make a version for rdna 3.5. Rdna3 should be getting one as well.,Negative
AMD,"Thanks so much for sharing this, it completely flew under my radar, it's definitely one I'm going to be keeping my eye on as I liked the design on the 2025 model. I would ideally prefer 16 inch but I love how this laptop has 2x m.2 so it will make it really easy to just slot my old SSD in and go.  I'm not worried much about the price, I wouldn't mind going a bit over £2000 for a 64gb model, definitely one I'm going to keep an eye on.",Positive

AMD,Nah I phrased it deliberately.  ATi was a top tier graphics card company; AMD bought them and turned them to shit.,Negative
AMD,"I was considering a framework desktop, how are you liking it?",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, if you are into very-SFF then this can do things other builds can't. Current Framework and Chinese Strix Halo 395 boards are priced at like $2700+ and with current DRAM shenanigans 388 with 32GB RAM may loose the price advantage it initially would have. Steam Machine will win this one by a big margin I guess.",Neutral

AMD,"they weren't top tier, they were also below nvidia most of the time. same as today really.",Negative
AMD,Ohhhh fair enough. I thought you meant that Radeon are holding AMD back (which they are rn).,Neutral
AMD,"Radeon's most successful period was under AMD from 2008-2013. They carried AMD for a lot of that time while their CPU division faltered.  Also ATI were in financial trouble when AMD bought them, so it was unlikely they could have continued without a buyout.",Neutral
AMD,"It's cool. Using it exclusively for llm models. It acts as the backend for OpenWeb uI. Since the nic is only 5Gb, I keep the models on the device. Eventually I'm going to put it in another case so I can use the x4 slot for a 25G card and centralize my model storage.  But performance is strong all things considered. It doesn't chug when trying to generate a result. I think the biggest delay is the time from when it loads the model requested into memory before it starts processing",Positive
AMD,"Looking through the CES news, I saw that AMD teased a reference dev box. They called it the Ryzen AI Halo. A AI Max+ 395 with 128GB. If there is even just a hint of them dropping this thing with a ""reasonable"" price tag in Germany, I'll just grab one of those.

AMD,"Honestly, the ms-02 ultra is what I was considering if using dgpu but it is almost twice the size. I would be hard pressed to beat the 3090 in my 15L so it needs to be a usff case or be close to matching my current rig in a slightly larger form factor (2-5L).",Neutral
AMD,Performance wise I have no clue but design wise it fills the same general market.  Hits in the same ballpark as a mobile 3060.

AMD,They’d lagged a bit but they still competed in the high end and in the early 2000s made halo products like the 9800 XT. Since their acquisition they’ve exclusively been “the cheaper alternative” and since Turing they’ve been generations behind.  The only new graphics tech I can think of from AMD era Radeon was the TressFX hair rendering (which basically only ran on Radeon cards).,Neutral

AMD,Because the competition is launching more exciting products that I wish my company would launch. To me laptops are really important segment as I can use it to explain to people what I used to do at work easily but eith Strix Point/Halo being so damn expensive and uncompetitive it just brings me a tinge of sadness.,Positive
AMD,"If you don't mind asking, which split specifically are you using for *glm-4.7 q2*?",Neutral
AMD,"I mean what would you need it for, in your use case? Is it for Jellyfin to stream faster?",Neutral
AMD,Use rclone instead of rsync or standard copy-paste for initial model uploads so that you can better saturate the bandwidth and do not use a switch do peer to peer it absolutely 0 benefit and adds latency and overhead unless multiple devices are connected to the central storage and that you cna not do peer to peer for some reason. Also  use a script to trigger a read of the model file into the storage server's RAM cache before the worker nodes request it so that the you cna leverage the full wire speed  also use a storage node and install a PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD. If you are gonna use a dedicated storage server use  ZFS Mirror or RAID-Z with multiple NVMe drives. You can use RDMA but you need a RoCE-capable NIC and if you re gonna get a Nic dont get a single 25g get dual since the pci4x4 port can support it and you can aggregate it. Also you can leverage like zram and cache the data in the ram. Both on the machine and on the storage  and  try to keep it in the ram or have it swap it to the zram on the storage one since its superior to the disk.,Neutral
AMD,"No, jellyfin does not need that much bandwidth; many tvs come with only 100 Mbit ethernet, and the streaming platform with the highest quality streams (Apple TV) top at about 50 Mbit.  The GP gave a hint: centrally storing LLM models. These files can be huge (e.g. gpt-oss-120b has ~64 GB, llama-3.3-70b has ~37 GB, glm-4.7 depending on quantization can have 100-250 GB), so you need as much bandwidth as possible when loading them over network.",Neutral

AMD,LOL.,Neutral
AMD,The 9850X3D at least had 400mhz higher clocks. This literally has 100mhz at *most* (most skus actually have zero clock bump not even 100mhz). They added skus that are *outright downgrades* from their predecessors (Ryzen 7 445 vs Ryzen 5 340).  This would be beyond embarrassing onstage.,Negative
AMD,"1: Not everyone can afford a dGPU laptop, especially with RAM+VRAM prices through the roof right now.  2: Most thin+light/ultrabook laptops are iGPU only.  3: RDNA3.5 not having FSR4 support is a massive issue. FSR3 is ass at 480p-900p internal resolution which is all that these 8-12CU iGPUs can handle in modern games.  4: The new Intel B390/B370 iGPUs looks really good right now with notebookcheck benchmarks showing 45fps in Cyberpunk at 1080p Ultra vs ~26fps on the 890m at native res. XeSS is also way better than FSR3 so at ""Quality"" mode (720p internal), it should be running at ~62fps with decent image quality.

AMD,"Time is money for productivity use cases tho. It’s situational, I don’t game much but it was easy for me to go with the 9950x3d for just an extra $100, especially when you’re likely pairing it with a 5090 if not 5080 as a top spec video editing rig.   A 4% improvement to a 4 hour render is 10 minutes saved, so it does add up quickly.",Positive
AMD,"It’s not a 4% improvement to the render, that was part of the point of that. It’s 4% to specific workloads within the program that are not a sizeable chunk of program time.  Your render time is wholly GPU driven in Davinci. Most of the actions done on the timeline and in color grading are also wholly GPU driven. The chip won’t save 4% of your time unless those specific actions are all you’re doing for some reason.  If you’re spending a lot of time in Unreal on tasks like shader compilations? Sure, that’s gonna save time and arguments could be made for it. Particularly since that line of work also often ends up running said unreal project, which itself benefits from the chip.  “don’t find the additional gaming performance worth the price increase over the 9950X and 9900X” is a literal quote from the article right after saying they can’t recommend the chips for every workflow, among a couple others, as a reason not to spend the extra money and the article is assuming MSRP that only puts them 50 apart.  Edit: 4% is within Pugent’s margin of error, as an aside.  Edit2: since people get territorial over this kind of stuff sometimes. I *have* an x3d chip. As I mentioned originally there’s essentially no difference in most workloads, it’s primarily a gaming chip. If you need the best option for gaming get one. If you need the best option for productivity specifically then there’s a big ol’ pause there with a lot of asterisks.",Neutral

It's also hard to tell without knowing marker shares.  For all we know, Asus and Asrock have 80% market share to them both, which would explain the reports...  At this point, either something is wrong with AMD, or these two manufacturers have something wrong with power limits in their bios.  Impossible to tell just with this data.

It's on 1.30v by default because to run 1:1 (MCLK/UCLK) at 6000, 6200, 6400 etc you usually need 1.25v to 1.30v especially if you're running FCLK higher than 2000Mhz  The ones running 1.15 and lower *(including myself in my testing)* are using 2:1 and running RAM at 7600Mhz+ to 8400mhz or higher   There's less strain on vSOC because you don't need to run 1:1 when using 2:1 but running 2:1 at 6000Mhz defeats the purpose and will lower performance.   Either way, both are safe and fine. Everything below 1.30v should be fine.",Neutral

AMD,"If AMD ever gets it together, the NPU could be used to offload AMD noise reduction and can also cleanup live webcam images too.  Otherwise, it has better uses in a more integrated system like a laptop.   Just wait until dGPUs have a type of NPU (much smaller and tailored to a very specific workload) directly integrated into the display engines to analyze images/frames (could support multi-frame accumulation and also denoise that) on the fly and apply transparent (to game/app) post-processing.

AMD,"The “AI” branding refers to the built-in NPU, which is required to get Microsoft Copilot certification. No current AMD desktop CPU has a NPU, but pretty much all models have at least a basic GPU, which makes the old “G” branding a bit redundant and confusing.",Neutral

AMD,>they should just name it a 9700g and call it a day.   You're deluding yourself if you think that the desktop SKUs won't switch to the new naming convention once they have a CoPilot+ certified NPU in them. That's the only reason Zen 5 desktop isn't using the same naming scheme.,Neutral
AMD,It doesn’t support anything special on the laptops so I don’t expect it will anything on desktop either.,Negative
AMD,Not really. It’s just more efficient to do tasks that benefit from an NPU. Desktop CPU + external GPU will always be better.,Positive

AMD,thanks for reiterating the npu to gpu distinction.,Positive
AMD,"gtk, in my case i care nothing for AI   i'm just willing to upgrade in this iDirection   to avoid buying a gpu card.   the 10yo games i play now seem to manage   just fine on my 7600 at 2k30fps.",Neutral
AMD,They probably think the NPU on an SoC can help with gaming like the tensor cores in an Nvidia gpu.,Neutral
AMD,Isn't the G series CPU basically a cut down desktop die so that they can fit a GPU die in it?,Neutral

AMD,"They do make the 7950X... Not sure how much they go for, but they're very similar CPUs with different TDPs.",Neutral
AMD,“9700NG” seemed too hard,Negative
AMD,"It does indeed, I had no idea. The news article I read about the AI 400 claimed it was the first. Or maybe it's just the first to qualify for the Copilot+ sticker, as the 8000G NPU seems to only do 16TOPS, while Microsoft mandates at least 40TOPS.",Neutral
AMD,"Fair enough. I think you work with what you've got. When I was in university I crashed my car and sold my GTX 1080 and played games on a 5770 for 6 months or so and tbh it was fine, I just accepted that it'd be low settings and older games.

AMD,No. We are asking if it could have something similar processing some day..,Neutral
AMD,Like I told the other guy Microsoft has already hinted that **DirectML + NPUs** will enable *hybrid GPU/NPU* upscaling pipelines.  So yes there will be some similar type processing.,Neutral
AMD,I've seen people do framegen on the iGPU so as not to burden the discrete gpu with it.   Whether it's actually worth it's anyone's guess.,Neutral
AMD,"No. That would just be a separate engineered die.   Ryzen desktop series are chiplet based. There’s a cpu chiplet connected to an i/o die chiplet on an am4/am5 socket. Note that zen4/5 include a small 2 CU gpu in the cpu die chiplet for basic video output purposes.   Ryzen mobile series are monolithic, no chiplets. Its just one single chip with up to a 12 CU gpu in it. All G series desktop chips are just mobile chips repurposed on a desktop socket.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4  You can see it in the wiki. The G series share the same ryzen product code name as mobile. “Phoenix”",Neutral

AMD,"Yep I've considered those, but I really wanted something that goes into an AM5 socket so I can upgrade the CPU in future.",Positive
AMD,The 7950X cpu is relatively expensive (~£475) it's also end of life so none of the reliable retailers have stock it's all 3rd party sellers. The 7945HX (cpu+mobo) are about £350 from minisforum.,Negative
AMD,"That's correct. I've got a 8700G and that was touted as 'the first desktop CPU with a NPU' back at launch (8600G is the weaker sibling, also has a NPU and was launched at the same date). Combined TOPS of 39, which is suspiciously just 1 short to qualify for Copilot+... Doesn't matter though, since I'm using Linux anyway 🙂",Neutral
AMD,nothing at all. They're just confused,Negative
AMD,"Good lord man, its too early on a Saturday morning to be beefing on reddit over nothing",Negative
AMD,"Smart Access Memory is AMD's term for Resizable BAR,  which allows the CPU to access the GPU's VRAM directly.  What they're probably question is whether the igpu on whathever this Gorgon Point/Halo series of APU can access the dgpu's RAM on top of the DIMMs available to the CPU socket.",Neutral
AMD,Similar in what way,Neutral
AMD,It’s still not handled by the NPU tho,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation. Especially the monolithic vs. chiplet design is important to note, physically they are totally different.  I've got a passively cooled desktop system and for that purpose these G parts are also a great fit. Due to the monolithic die the idle power consumption is notably lower, which is what you want when you need maximum efficiency for limited cooling capacity.",Positive
AMD,"Oh wow, nice to know",Positive
AMD,interesting  I did not know,Neutral
AMD,smart access video is hybrid processing..,Neutral
AMD,"let me have my fun, it's night time",Positive
AMD,"No it just allows the buffer to be **resizeable** the access remains the same.  And no they did not mention the iGPU once, they said NPU. And even if it could, what would the benefit be? Games render using one GPU or the other, not both. So why access an inactive GPU's VRAM data? Even if you could write to it like extra memory, that defeats the entire point of VRAM, it's just far far too slow, it would kill performance.  So again what are THEY talking about?",Neutral
AMD,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".  It's only a question of how large the mapped address area is, and where in VRAM it's pointing at any given moment.",Neutral
AMD,"Not yét, however DirectML will supposedly enable this.",Neutral
AMD,Between a dGPU and an iGPU specifically their hardware video encoding/decoding  nothing to do with ai or games or the npu,Neutral

AMD,arent the non XT just XT's that had too many failing cores?  they disable the failed cores and any extra leftovers to meet the the requirements for non XT spec... so how is this even news,Negative
AMD,They should try and keep the price down as 9070 XT will be the most viable upgrade for most people if the 5070 TI gets blown out.  The other AMD gpus are not enough of an uplift despite FSR 4 if you have say a 7800 XT or a 4070,Neutral
AMD,"700/16=43.75$ 600/16=37.5$  Limited vram availability   Same vram, more revenue...  Same logic will apply to other models, depending on their tier.   With amd it is easier, 9060 9070 variants only.  For nvidia it will be more difficult which models to keep making or not.",Neutral

AMD,I mean it’s the same exact situation as the 5070ti vs 5080.,Neutral
AMD,Binning nowadays (well really for quite some time now) is not going to be solely based on actual defect or parametric yield rates but market needs.   As in a lot (if not most in some cases) of the disabled parts company sell you are not actually defective just fused off in hardware or software due to market needs.,Neutral
AMD,Apparently you can flash a 9070 XT bios onto a 9070 so it runs like the XT,Neutral
AMD,Good for people who don’t want to upgrade the power supply ( I was one of them) plus it’s still a beast of a card and an efficient one at that,Positive
AMD,Nothing. Its talking about future production. They are still going to produce both but they are making bets on the XT since vram cost is outrageous.,Neutral
AMD,Yes it was and is literally that simple   Let’s see if amd somehow misses this opportunity too,Neutral
AMD,AMDs GPU division never fail to miss an opportunity.,Positive
AMD,"Exactly, lol. Its cute.",Positive
AMD,>whatever contracts they have for GDDR run out  This is probably a cope but I'm hoping the fact that they use GDDR6 instead of GDDR6X or GDDR7 will help them with supply issues since it's an older memory type that (probably) isn't very useful for the AI arms race.,Neutral

AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die.

A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough.

AMD,">We need to stop looking at the Core Ultra 9 285K through the lens of a typical generational refresh  That's all what consumers care about. They don't care if ARL on paper or on theory is some great reset. Perf, power, and cost is what's important.   >he 285K is suffering from the acute growing pains of decoupling the compute complex from the uncore in a way that creates a distinct latency penalty that enthusiasts are mistaking for regression.  It's not being ""mistaken"" for a regression, it quite literally is one.   The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.  Nothing about ARL's current design prioritizes ppw or area efficiency over RPL's design from a chiplets vs monolithic perspective. ARL isn't enabling higher core counts from going chiplets, that seems to be left to NVL according to rumors. And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs? Especially with the old intel socket performing just as well on a more mature platform, for most end users this first core ultra series just isn't worth investing.",Neutral

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware of CHIPS.  Like I said, I want Intel to be competitive. I hope if their new layouts mature into something that can retake marketshare that the same care will be taken to preserve AMD. AFAIK, no one came to lend them money or sign large multifaceted partnerships at that time. This ""must save Intel,"" movement is something that is borne out of how big Intel is. They're too big to fail, it would have too many implications for the economy. It's not tit for tat, but as they are both American companies and AMD has significantly more invested in my country, I don't feel particularly motivated to help bail out Intel when they have the equivalent of the iron rice bowl rolled out for them at the moment. I'll buy what works best for my needs at the time I'm buying, as always, and if Intel can make a better gaming focused, with some imagery stitching on the side, processor than AMD can at the time I'm buying, that's the direction I'll go.  Ultimately the 200 series is what the Ryzen 1000 series was, but more stable as Intel has always had better support both internally and from vendors. I have no doubt Intel may catch AMD.

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

Also, ARL runs at lower clock speeds than RPL, so in some cases newer process nodes actually clock lower.   this happened many times before like 32nm SNB OC better than 22nm IVB and haswell or even 14nm 6000 series skylake, so no in most cases new process nodes don't improve clock speeds or at least not on desktop.",Negative
AMD,"Okay, so we've gone right off the rails of a logical discussion. I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

AMD,That crazy amount of cash being spent by Pat is what enabled 18A and 14A. They HAD to buy multuple $250M Litho machines from ASML in order to make that possible. Pat was playing catch up after years of under-investment by Swan and Krzanich. It was necessary and LBT is getting the credit.

AMD,"If they're following industry standards I'd say it depends on how good AMD's next gen is. Intel doesn't need direct access to AMD designs to etch chips for them, and designers make way more than per wafer than foundries do.  If AMD has superior designs to intel again they could finally ship out some damn chips for laptop OEMs. It would hurt intel more than the revenue would benefit them imo since client has really been carrying intel for the last six years and demand for AMD chips has been high despite the drip feed of strix chips. honestly I'm considering an AIO/NUC/whatever the new name is with strix halo and unified LPDDR5 to upscale old footage without having to use my daily desktop. imagine if it was available at scale.",Neutral

AMD,"I mean no offense, but Passmark is irrelevant.  Even comparing the 890m to the 7600m (non-xt), the 7600m is usually twice as fast, with dips down to ~60% faster, and lifts up to ~170% faster.     NoteBookCheck has an extremely robust dataset of benchmarks in games for both the 890m and the 7600m (non-xt) at various resolutions, and they show not only a clear winner, but a very large difference in the performance of these devices.      Now I'm not trashing what the B390 will be, because we need an iGPU fight here.  But thinking that the 7600m (non-xt) is only ~15.7% faster than the B390 ((new-old)/old gives percent change) because of Passmark is erroneous.",Neutral

AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable.

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good.

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming).

This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU.

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit.

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.

AMD,"Hello, I'm experiencing an intermittent but severe system hard freezes on a prebuilt PowerSpec G441 desktop purchased from Micro Center 2 years ago. The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

AMD,"u/hus1030  The mounting pressure from your AIO cooler can directly affect whether the system successfully completes POST. When the cooler is tightened too much, it can cause the CPU or motherboard to bend slightly, which may lead to poor or lost contact between the CPU and the socket pins. This prevents the processor from initializing properly, resulting in a no-POST condition. Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications. If the issue persists, you may need to verify that the contact frame is correctly installed or temporarily revert to the original retention bracket to rule out pressure-related problems.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.  USB flash recovery method is definitely worth trying first - it's designed specifically for these types of firmware corruption issues and should get your laptop back to normal boot times without all those frustrating restarts.

That error code you're seeing (0x00020001) is actually what's called a ""hypervisor error,"" which basically means it's a problem with Windows' virtualization stuff rather than directly being caused by your WiFi drivers.  The real culprits are more likely things like memory issues, BIOS problems, or conflicts with virtualization features like Hyper-V.

AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral

AMD,My motherboard is Asrock H670-M Pro RS. firmware version: 18.01,Neutral
AMD,Hello. I want to tell you i7-12700f does NOT support TME. Thank you for your help anyway.,Negative
AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3. Data center GPU offerings 4. Move all pc chiplets back to Intel nodes and start to fill up the fabs again",Neutral
AMD,An Intel + nVidia handheld would be something I would welcome just for DLSS4 alone.,Positive
AMD,"I don’t think it will change that much overall.  It’s no secret that NVIDIA wanted a x86 license for decades now and now they basically got it. This will ""hurt"" AMD by offering competition to markets where AMD currently holds a monopoly like with Strix Halo, most handhelds and consoles.  I don’t think we’ll see big changes on the Intel side.  I don’t think this will affect neither the iGPUs nor ARC because why would it.",Negative
AMD,"this jointventure is NOT about consumer gpu and does not change anythig about gaming gpu of intel, amd or nvidia.  this is instantly obvioiusly from just reading the headlines of the news announcing this.   this tumbnail is just hub using this news to suggest jet another time that maybe amd might just be screwed. they do this because they are neutral in every way.",Negative
AMD,"i think it's bad for us, consumers",Negative
AMD,Was the team up really to crush AMD or Nvidia's answer to enter China?,Neutral
AMD,AMDware unboxed only cares about AMD anyway,Neutral
AMD,This hurts the arc division way more than this could ever hurt amd.,Negative
AMD,They will crush user's wallet,Negative
AMD,you guys realize Nvidia buys all their stuff from TSMC the same company that makes all of AMD's stuff...So now intel will buy from them too since they cant compete? Because no amount of Intel+Nvidia humping is going to make a TSMC baby...you got to pay to play.,Neutral
AMD,"Even assuming they made monster co-op AMD still has own ecosystem of GPU and CPU, along with consumer support. It's Radeon and Ryzen are still very strong consumer wise. So no, AMD is not screwed",Positive
AMD,Remember Kaby Lake G? No? This will also be forgotten soon.,Negative
AMD,Yes.,Positive
AMD,Intel partners with UMC of Taiwan the third largest foundry in the world.    What does it mean for UMC and Intel?   How will it affect transfer / exchange of technology between Taiwan and Intel?   How does this affect TSMC position with USAG?,Neutral
AMD,Foveros baby!,Positive
AMD,AMDUnboxed on suicide watch.,Negative
AMD,"For mobile/laptop performance, yes AMD is in the dust, maybe? Makes sense since AMD GPU division is mainly focused on the console partnership with Sony/Microsoft--leaves the mobile platform wide open.",Neutral
AMD,"Who knows, time will tell. But if AMD does find its back against the wall, this is when it does its best. This should be interesting to say the least.",Positive
AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics. The 3D performance was better than Intel, but features like CUDA, and a good handful of video decoding capabilities were missing. You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive. I know they have a lot of tricks up their sleeves still, like designing HBM memory onto the die (how Vega was supposed to be originally) and unified memory (soldered down, see the new AI branded chips).",Negative
AMD,Ohh noooerrrrrrrrr,Negative
AMD,"Actually this may be good for AMD and I will tell you why: Open source drivers. Nvidia if they had a say in intels graphics division would make the intel GPU stuff proprietary and locked down and when support ends its gonna hurt. Meanwhile AMD has open source drivers and in the age that linux is gaining popularity will make it the preferred platform for anyone interested in the growing linux ecosystem. Nvidia will NEED to change how they handle things or intel may not be as attractive as they once were, intel has already suffered a massive knock on thier reputation and this may be the mortal wound that can work in AMD's favor.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't see how this means anything at all for AMD in desktop. This is borderline irrelevant for desktop gaming. Most users pick up an Intel or AMD CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU.  APUs don't really exist in desktop gaming.  In mobile? I think most people won't care much. Intel and AMD APUs both offer compelling and reasonable alternatives for everyday usage. Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.  In all other cases I dont see this being a compelling option.",Neutral
AMD,So either a 200w igpu with a 300w intel cpu or an intel cpu with a 5030 slapped on it?  I think amd will be fine,Neutral
AMD,welcome to the Nvidia and amd duopoly,Positive
AMD,"I’m really curious what the power efficiency ends up looking like here - mobile performance/W has continued to be very good in recent Intel platforms, and Nvidia is the market leader in that regard among gpu IHVs. But until now, Nvidia chips being intrinsically dGPUs has completely neutered any potential mobile power efficiency or handheld capability - but not anymore if such a thing can be a chiplet/tile! Interesting days ahead…",Positive
AMD,"By that time amd will have already made an FSR4 capbable handheld, so no significant change",Neutral
AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral
AMD,a partnership doesnt mean they get free reign over license lol,Neutral
AMD,"AMD already has the next gen of consoles. Except for the Switch, which NVIDIA already has (with ARM, not with Intel).",Neutral
AMD,"None, It's a way for NVidia to have another product line and stop Intel from having a competitive product line.",Neutral
AMD,"Not to crush amd, but this essentially just kills arc and hurts the consumer market more. You won't be getting any of those 250 dollar 12gb gpus anymore.",Negative
AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer. Intel cannot afford to invest in products that will take a very long time to generate profit or may never generate profit. If even AMD cannot compete with Nvidia, then Intel will likely never be able too either",Negative
AMD,"Be civil and follow Reddiquette, uncivil language, slurs and insults will result in a ban.",Negative
AMD,Past != Future,Neutral
AMD,"nvidia also used to make motherboard chipset, with mixed success.",Neutral
AMD,FSR 4 looks like the later versions of Dlss 2 did,Neutral
AMD,"This ""insignificant change"" we definitely want though.  Competition is good in a stagnant market...",Neutral
AMD,"Other than Halo SKU which we are yet to establish any trend of, AMD notoriously drags their feet. RDNA3 will be with us for a while",Negative
AMD,Wont this be targetting the ML workstation space where you have the iGPU with access to >128GB of RAM like Strix Halo with DMA and/or NVLink banswidth?,Neutral
AMD,">maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive  Possibly an overlap like this would be a waste of money developing, and tbh I highly doubt customers would go for the Intel option rather than a Nvidia one, *even if* the Intel option is better performing, because of Nvidia's insane mind share.",Neutral
AMD,Never said that.,Neutral
AMD,Also a way for Nvidia to invest some of their funny money (which is essentially infinite) into a cheap company. Intel under $20 was ludicrous. Intel is still at book value at $29.,Neutral
AMD,Why do so many people think that this will kill ARC?,Negative
AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits. But they have raised those limits, and the open NVIDIA drivers are getting better in time.",Positive
AMD,"Yup. Their nForce boards were great for overclocking, but rather buggy too.",Negative
AMD,"It's not a later version of dlss 2, it's between dlss 3 and 4. Just go watch some videos comparing both.   And btw redstone is coming probably at the end of this year which will improve ray tracing quality and frame gen performance.",Neutral
AMD,"No reputable reviewer thinks that. Most I've seen say it's better than DLSS 3, and very slightly behind DLSS 4.  Why lie about this?",Negative
AMD,They literally haven't said a word about it everyone's just speculating off of Moore's laws anti Intel videos lol consumer is the last thing they care for atm and might be server first cause that makes the most financial sense,Negative
AMD,If they do that in the case the two companies deal fall apart Intel is screwed with no graphics to compete with even the basic amd ones,Negative
AMD,"Well phrased, They now have a seat at the table of Intel to sway votes enough to dissuade them from making competitive products",Neutral
AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.   I on the other hand don't get why would Intel forfeit it's competitive advantage with GPU accelerated AI, XeSS or QuickSync and made itself dependant on nVidia. Doesn't make sense especially now, when they have significant influx of cash from both Nvidia and government.",Negative
AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns. Their own road maps had their gpus coming out a year sooner but everything got delayed with them resizing the company. Like this deal is not exactly what killed arc, but arc was already struggling beforehand so this was most likely the nail in the coffin.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia does not have an A310 competitor.,Neutral
AMD,But I still remember how many motherboards with Nvidia chipsets I replaced way back.  They used to reliably overheat and need a reflow.  I think it was the HP DV6000 and DV9000 series.,Neutral
AMD,I have not lied,Neutral
AMD,"While workstations dont directly contribute a big chunk of the sales, I suspect they dont want to yield their foothold on the ML/Data Science guys.  If they start getting familiar with non-nVIDIA ecosystems, it could mean indirect losses when these guys start procuring non-nVIDIA dGPUs in servers when they do port their workstation experiments to ""larger"" hardware now that AI is all the rage.  B60 is gaining momentum on homelabs, and Strix Halo to some extent getting popular for those needing more memory for their larger datasets.",Neutral
AMD,"MLID has used clickbait trash thumbnails/titles way too many times, no one should watch that garbage channel to begin with.",Negative
AMD,"I think Intel priced in multiple generations of taking losses when they decided to enter the GPU market. Essentially impossible to walk in to a mature duopoly market and immediately start turning profit as a new player, even with Intel's resources.  Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Negative
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus. Like a b580 destroys the 5060 and 5050 while costing less or the same amount. There's no way nvidia invests 5 billion without some agreement that kills off arc as long as they are together.,Negative
AMD,Their nForce boards were excellent for overclocking and tinkering! That's for sure. I also remember them being a bit buggy lol.,Positive
AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Negative
AMD,"You did tho. It doesn't look like ""later versions of DLSS 2"". Every reputable source has said it's better than DLSS 3 and close to DLSS 4",Positive
AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Neutral
AMD,"Wrong man. You just don’t understand how small the diypc market is compared to prebuilts, laptops, and enterprise- it’s a fraction of one percent.",Negative
AMD,The later versions of Dlss 2 look like Dlss 3,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia probably feels the same about their low end SKUs.,Neutral
AMD,"The DIYPC market largely drives the “prebuilt” market, with a 1-3 generation lag.  Many people who buy “prebuilts” have people they go to for advice (i.e. they talk to their friends/family members who DIY). When there’s a big swing in the DIY market, it typically ripples out to the prebuilt market over a few years/generations.",Neutral
AMD,"Lol, what an explanation hahahaha   And that's still not ""better than DLSS 3"" as most say",Negative
AMD,Yeah lol,Positive
AMD,AMD Unboxed say anything about that? What about Linus Cheap Tips!,Neutral
AMD,"""Everyone I don't like is biased""-ass answer",Negative
