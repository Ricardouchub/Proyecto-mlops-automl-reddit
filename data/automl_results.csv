Intel,"Solid product, nice foundation. Improve ST and intel will comfortably keep their mobile market",Positive
Intel,"Strix halo is a commercial failure. Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.    Intel couldn't care less about that, they just need to be better than 890M and the game is done.",Negative
Intel,"I think the ideal would be to get to a point where the flagship ""mainstream"" iGPUs (-H series, for Intel) compete with Nvidia's contemporary x50 GPUs, and then have big iGPU chips (Strix Halo, NVL-AX?) to compete with x60+ level.",Neutral
Intel,"If these chips end up cheap enough that they can replace the standard Intel CPU + 50/60 tier mobile Nvidia dGPU it will be very interesting.  I'm not sure they will be able to in the short term, Nvidia pricing on low end mobile dGPUs is very aggressive ($600 5050 laptops are the proof) but hopefully it isn't long before this type of powerful iGPU becomes a common thing.",Positive
Intel,I’d love to see its support outside of the approved games demo list. Intel has great hardware but their drivers and game support have always been the biggest question.  What’s the point of hardware if you can’t apply it to what you need.,Neutral
Intel,"This is against a 50W TBP RTX 4050 Laptop (which should be more at ease around 90-100W)  Not saying it's bad, but you can't compare Laptop performances without including TDP configuration and behavior.",Neutral
Intel,"""taking on strix halo"" -> result 50% of strix halo performance, ok.",Neutral
Intel,Wtf is this article? Strix halo is another class product. Takes on strix halo being more than 50% slower?,Negative
Intel,"TWELVE efficiency cores?.... that's nuts.   Anywho, these results look good. Assuming CPU and battery life are comparable or better than Strix Point/Gorgon Point, Intel might have a nice little advantage.",Positive
Intel,"I'm sorry but nothing was more embarrassing than that guy from AMD the other day saying it doesn't matter because Strix Halo, a chip in so few devices that's an absolute behemoth, is still faster. Panther Lake is an absolute achievement for Intel. With the right drivers, they're going to have the perfect chip to forgo low end dGPUs.",Positive
Intel,I will need at die fast ultrabook with 12hrs+ battery  Its Not a gaming product,Negative
Intel,Website doesn’t load with adblocker,Negative
Intel,"I'm hoping for a thin and light 16 inch laptop with Panther lake and a B390, as it'll be perfect for photo editing, as Adobe seems to prefer Intel over AMD graphics and a discrete GPU is overkill.",Positive

Intel,I am more interested in next gen desktop APUs,Neutral
Intel,"Compared to my 890M based laptop, the 890M numbers here are about 15-20% lower than what I'm seeing at the same settings.  This is likely due to power targets?  Even if the uplift is just 60% instead of 80%, that's still an impressive achievement for the B390M.  It's a shame that AMD appears to have dropped the iGPU ball in 2026.  Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.  The upcoming HX470, and still without FSR4, isn't going to close the apparent large gap.  It seems that AMD forgot to stay hungry and they'll end up losing whatever ground that they'd gained in the last few years.  Mind you, Intel is known to play pressure games with laptop makers too in order to limit AMD adoption, which just makes it even crazier that AMD isn't doing what's required to keep the pressure on.",Negative
Intel,"I think the B390 could be faster than even an RTX 5050 35W (As it could beat an RTX 4050 at 60W).       These thin and light laptops that Panther Lake is built for use way underpowered GPUs. Honestly, it makes sense why the Dell XPS 14 only has the B390 graphics. Before it used an RTX 4050, but it ran at just 30W of power.       Now that Integrated Graphics have beat the -50 Tier of GPUs I don't think we'll even see an RTX 6050 or RX 9050",Positive
Intel,"the 140v also got a 25% speed boost post launch, if something similar happens than this could be as good as a 5060 mobile... which is wild! I hope it dosen't cost as much as halo strix!",Positive
Intel,Needs a conroe vs fx62 moment. It doesn't look promising.,Negative
Intel,Why aren't they comparing the AMD 8060S in the current Strix Halo flagship to the Intel B390? Probably because it doesn't go intel's way... interesting.,Neutral
Intel,And yet maybe 5% of customers will buy this version because its absolutely irrelevant for them whether their laptop would have an Iris iGPU from 2014 or a 2500watt RTX 5090.,Negative
Intel,"Thats great. If you are nvidia making dedicated gpu, then better make something that is not shit. 4050 is a joke",Positive
Intel,"But how much does it cost? It mentions it having 16 cores so I'm guessing it's going to be overpriced if you don't need CPU performance, just like Strix Halo.",Negative
Intel,They need a 25% IPC increase to get back to the leading edge in CPU and honestly i don't see it with their current architecture. They need a new radical design   Edit: getting downvoted for what?. Currently Apple and QC have a very solid lead. Even ARM beats Intel and AMD in general CPU workloads and Intel/AMD have been very slow to update their uarch focusing on clock speed over efficiency and IPC,Negative
Intel,"AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 388 just dropped cheaper than the 395 with the same GPU, it will be cheaper than the panther lake.",Positive
Intel,> Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.   So basically every decent APU ever made. Too expensive to the point it bumps into dGPU territory and not powerful enough to be a direct replacement.,Negative
Intel,> Strix halo is a commercial failure. Too expensive for any meaningful customer to adopt and have real mainstream products.  >  >   Story of AMD APUs.,Negative
Intel,"AMD aimed Strix Halo at AI users first and foremost, thinking those folks would pay the high premiums.   But of course anybody serious about AI would have an Nvidia GPU, and so many other AI users are still just using cloud-based services anyways.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD has always had lower supply compared to Intel and yet AMD client continues to grow. Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel. Strix Halo is still continuing to have designs made, it wouldn't be a 'failure' if we are still getting Strix Halo products at CES...  I wrote a [comment in a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1q7d67m/comment/nyhh23c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the reality of the state of Intel and AMD in the mobile segment. Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand. Do I wish AMD stop stagnating in designs, yeah, RDNA3 needs to go, but these companies have motives in what they do.",Neutral
Intel,"We all saw it coming a mile away, when it came out in 2025 it was competing against discounted 4060 laptops as low as just $1000. Too little, too late, too expensive, dated on arrival with RDNA3.5, etc. But for some reason this sub and r / amd always have such a hard on at the concept of a ""big APU"" that in practice would never be economically sensible.",Negative
Intel,Arc 140T is already on par with the 890m for most tasks excluding games.,Neutral
Intel,Commercial failure indeed. Laptop with dGPUs at same price perform better. Laptops with solid CPU perf are much cheaper.,Neutral
Intel,AMD gave Strix Halo zero chance to compete by barely selling any of the lower end models. An 8 core with 32 CUs would be a great mini PC.,Negative
Intel,"Depends on Intel's & amd power targets. I dont think its rly feesible for them to target cpu + gpu power usage, 100W combined at least?",Neutral
Intel,then we wouldnt have the 50 gpus anymore. The XX30 and XX40 GPUs died because of iGPUs competing with them.,Negative
Intel,"If TSMC does raise price on their node, Nvidia doesn't find another node for their lower-end bins and Intel can keep the price on their own node down low, we could see Nvidia simply slowly phasing out the -50 series like they used to do with the MX series.",Neutral
Intel,"I dunno Battlemage was a big step forward on driver compatibility and every month Intel improves all their Arc compatibility. I'd be honestly surprised if Xe3 was worse than their current offerings. I'm sure it still has shortcomings as all Intel GPUs will because they're simply starting fresh, but even my A750 is pretty good right now at playing anything I throw at it.  The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative
Intel,Driver support is better than ever and will continue to get better now that Intel has found its footing in the gaming GPU business (yes that includes igpus),Positive
Intel,"The 4050 still has a sizeable memory bandwidth advantage, so it's still very surprising that the B390 comes so close.",Neutral
Intel,"oh damn, this should be a lot higher up! Most laptops have them clocked much higher so expecting 4050mobile performance is kinof a lie...",Negative
Intel,"I get the feeling everybody is still unsure where these PTL chips slot in to and what to compare these against actually. Once we get more info on pricing, power consumption, CPU performance etc. we will get some actually useful comparisons.",Neutral
Intel,I actually think they meant to say Strix Point in the headline there.,Neutral
Intel,"[HP ZBook Ultra G1a 14](https://www.notebookcheck.net/HP-ZBook-Ultra-G1a-14-review-Powerful-MacBook-Pro-alternative-for-work-and-game.994758.0.html) would've been a better test  Load average: 83.3W   Cyberpunk 2077 ultra \* 110.9W = 80.7fps  Baldur's gate 3: 99.4fps   B390 wattage?   If pantherlake is designed for battery, is it better if it loses performance?",Neutral
Intel,So how many sub 1000 dollar laptops we have with Strix Halo?,Neutral
Intel,The new MSI Prestige 16 looks nice.  They all seem to lack Thunderbolt 5 though.,Positive
Intel,"It seems the revived Dell XPS 16 will have the “B390” and no dGPU, as another option. LTT’s video on it said Dell is quoting 27 hours of battery life in “general tasks” and 40 hours of video playback. Obviously remains to be seen how real those manufacturers claims are, but here’s hoping.",Neutral
Intel,"$1100 for a little MSI 13"" laptop with one. there are also quite a few CPU SKUs that have the B390.",Neutral
Intel,"Those 16 cores are 4 performance cores, 8 efficiency cores and 4 “Low Power” efficiency cores. This is only doubling the core count of Lunar Lake, by adding the two plain efficiency core clusters. Or keeping the same core count as ArrowLake mobile’s 285H (not HX!), trading 2 performance cores for 2 “Low Power” efficiency cores.  I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  Prices should be more normal, as this is more part of Intel’s normal lineup.",Neutral
Intel,There's an Ultra 5 chip with the B370 (10 Xe cores instead of the 12). Shouldn't be too costly,Neutral
Intel,It's 16 cores but it's only comparable to Strix Point 12 cores and not Strix Halo.      The highest end Intel chip here only matches the number of P cores in the M5,Neutral
Intel,"I really don't think that is so important for mobile devices though.  All Intel needs to do is be ""good enough"" and the OEMs will use them in flagship models.",Neutral
Intel,I doubt anybody is going unseat Apple from the ST throne in the near future.,Negative
Intel,Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens. Frequencies also seem to have taken a hit on 18A but I'd expect that to improve with time as usual,Neutral
Intel,Not really. They just need to not completely bungle gaming and latency sensitive performance like with Arrow.,Neutral
Intel,"This is about mobile devices, and since a high performing IGPU is included, the question is no longer how well the CPU performs in a system with a 5090 (what most cpu benchmarks focus on) but how well this IGPU/CPU combination performs compared to other IGPU/CPU combinations. I am positive the CPU is not the limiting factor in this IGPU performance tier, so ""leading edge CPU performance"" is not really relevant.",Neutral
Intel,"It would be viable if AMD released their own small PCs with it to cut the MSRP of products, but they aren't interested.",Neutral
Intel,And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Of course we don't know the cost breakdown there as far as PS5 pricing goes.,Neutral
Intel,They just need to make the next iteration cost less. Most of strix halo's issues were the sky high price.,Negative
Intel,"""Local LLM"" is such an incredibly niche thing I can't believe the tech nerd internet is so obsessed over it. Any real life business use case of AI is cloud based no question asked.",Neutral
Intel,well said,Positive
Intel,Too much listening to MLiD who has a boner for APUs,Negative
Intel,"Idk one can easily flip your statement. Panther lake coming in **2026** competing against continuing discounted 4050s prob less than 4060s. I don't dislike Panther Lake nor am I defending Strix Halo, but I wouldn't say your argument is a rather good one.",Neutral
Intel,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ymoiWv9BF7Q   It's already at least on par for reasonable power profiles unless you play stuck to the wall.,Neutral
Intel,"Don't think it's completely absurd. Should get some efficiencies from less interconnect overhead and lower power memory, so not quite 1:1 with a dGPU. If we were to budget, say, 40W for the iGPU in gaming and 20W for the rest, should be perfectly in line with the higher end laptop SKUs.",Neutral
Intel,Intel Arrow Lake already uses 80W just on the CPU side in multicore,Neutral
Intel,Isn't TSMC planning to increase pricing on n2 by 20-30%,Neutral
Intel,Nvidia will find another cheap node to use. Samsung will gladly oblige,Positive
Intel,"Huge step forward, I just wish the didn’t struggle with older and brand new games. It’s a great card if you are willing to do troubleshooting and know computers but I won’t recommend them to family yet.",Positive
Intel,I hope they start supporting dx11 stuff. That’s a ton of games.,Positive
Intel,"153 GB/s vs 192 GB/s is not that ""sizeable""  And the comparison against ""HP OmniStudio X 32-c0077ng"" is weird, even in the linked test they have GPU-Z screenshot displaying 1375Mhz memory speed instead of 2000 Mhz on most other RTX 4050 Laptop Review.  I don't understand this comparison against an All-in-One, and I'll wait for more in depth reviews to draw some conclusion.",Negative
Intel,"PC World had power consumption tests under gaming loads. It pulled 60W through USBC with Cyberpunk, so probably 35-40W for the gpu. When they unplugged it, the benchmark numbers stayed the same. So it also pulls 60W on battery.  Unless the manufacturer actually configured the device to simultaneously pull energy from the cord and battery under full load.",Neutral
Intel,About as much as we have PTL laptops,Neutral
Intel,"TB5 isn't a big deal, although I don't like that they have a numpad keyboard, and usually MSI speakers are terrible.",Negative
Intel,But can't you get a laptop with a 5060-5070 at that price?,Neutral
Intel,"Damn, that's really good! it's pretty much macbook air pricing.",Positive
Intel,"> I’m not 100% on this but I don’t think Stryx Halo used AMD’s C cores, so it basically had an entire 9950x attached to the iGPU.  I have a Strix Halo.  What you wrote is exactly what it is.  It's essentially a 9950x (so all P-cores) with a fat iGPU attached, and with a 4 channel memory controller instead of 2-channel.",Neutral
Intel,"The biggest difference between the P and E cores is fMax. The larger the core count becomes, the lower the all core clocks become, the smaller the gap between P and E core performance becomes.   The IPC difference between the two is like ~10%  At a certain point along the wattage curve, given a certain number of cores, there will be a point where E core performance can potentially meet or exceed what you would've gotten has you had too many P cores.    Its also more than just trading 2 P cores for 2 lpE cores. The lpE cores in ARL-H were *so* weak, they were functionally useless. In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores. If you have 16 cores and are running all core workloads, then at 60W, each core is receiving less than 4W.",Neutral
Intel,No it's firmly ahead of strix its right in between. Strix point uses 8 ecores too and it gets demolished in multithread benchmarks as expected,Neutral
Intel,"It affects their margins. The more competitive and better QC is, the less Intel can charge OEMs for their CPUs.     AMD made them lower margins for laptop chips because they weren't very competitive. If they want fat margins, they need to be the best",Neutral
Intel,Single Core is very important when Intel is doing these designs that lack P cores throughout. The cheapest X2 Elite has the same amount of P cores as the most expensive Panther Lake SKU,Neutral
Intel,"Qualcomm is already super close with Oryon V3...  Perf/Watt for that single thread isn't close I guess, but absolute performance is breathing down Apple's neck for sure.  Also, don't compare Geekbench scores on windows vs Linux/Apple/Android... Windows just does something negatively about it and the difference is 5-7% vs non-windows.",Neutral
Intel,>Well unified core is supposed to be happening in the next couple of gens.  I would be shocked if this has much to do with a large performance uplift. I imagine it would have to do more with rightsizing core area and power draw.,Negative
Intel,Chasing above 5Ghz is stupid on laptops. It only matters for desktops,Negative
Intel,You are overly focusing on gaming. I mean general CPU performance,Neutral
Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"What is possible? PS5 uses GDDR6 instead of DRAM. And consoles are heavily subsidized by digital purchases. I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral
Intel,Even their Ryzen 5 AI 340 laptop are too expensive and you can buy an older gen Ryzen 5 with Nvidia GPU laptop for same price or even lower with much better GPU performance.,Negative
Intel,"To be frank, high end mobile gaming is also pretty niche.   There are edge cases for AI.   However, the pricing for strix halo was just awkward. At the price levels their SKUs were coming, you might as well go with a nice M4 max and call it a day.",Negative
Intel,Local AI (not just LLM) is universal on mobile and getting to be universal in corporate computers. You just dont see it. The background blurring in Teams meeting? 5x more battery efficient with AI. But its just going to be integrated into Teams and fire up if hardware supported without asking you.  >Any real life business use case of AI is cloud based no question asked.

Intel,"Panther Lake is a normal CPU, not some special ""big APU."" It doesn't make much sense to flip the argument the way you did.",Negative
Intel,"140T (Arrow Lake) isn't the same as 140v (Lunar Lake) though, the former is usually quite a bit weaker and inconsistent in games despite slaying all the synthetics.",Negative
Intel,Rtx 5050 is 61% faster than B390. I doubt if they change the wattage configuration and stick to 60W they'll match it. Unless the 5050 is capped to more reasonable wattages like 60-80W. Plus the 60W budget for Intel/amd will be used for other compotents and the apu budget reduces.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm talking out of my knowledge base, but I think the switch from heat pipes to custom vapor chambers means we are less bottlenecked at power density / pulling heat from the chip and more constrained at what the radiator/fan system can push out of the system.",Neutral
Intel,"It is probably because the AIO was one of their most, if not the most recent RTX 4050 tested (March 17th 2025) which probably enabled them to compare in newer title like F1 25 in the article, as it has already been around for like 3 years while RTX 5050 was released last year and received more attention in its place overall. From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.

I had some issues with an older Civ game, I reported an issue in [their app](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057021/graphics/other-graphics.html) with screenshots/etc, and while I never got any notification, the game works perfectly now a few months later. Dunno if they read those reports, but my card keeps getting better.  I actually think a MSRP B580 is another card that will age like fined wine -- YMMV depends on games you play, but in Australia they have been regularly sold slightly below international MSRP and represent phenomenal value in the price class.",Positive
Intel,That's bloody good for an iGPU. It's been nice to see them finally get to respectable performance over the last few years. Intel in particular has really upped their iGPU game & it shows.,Positive
Intel,not to mention it is a little skewed as they threw in a title which pushed the vram limit on the 4050 making the b390 over 800 percent faster in that title which obviously messes with the average.,Negative
Intel,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Positive
Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
Intel,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive
Intel,They're a lot more accurate than whatever the fuck Nvidia has been doing where you have to decode their bar graphs for proper scaling lmao,Negative
Intel,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too. There were heaps of MSI Claw promotional booths / draws at shopping malls / public places in Australia and it was heavily discounted.  I picked one up for about $550 AUD (after rebates; tax included), which is like $369 USD inclusive of tax.",Neutral
Intel,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds. Something like the Radeon 890M have done fine with such speeds",Neutral
Intel,"> I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800   You're looking at normal DDR, not LPDDR. LPDDR5-9600 *is* a JEDEC spec, and already available in mobile.",Neutral
Intel,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral
Intel,"I doubt it's exactly 73% outside of cherrypicked games, but it should not be shocking that it's significantly faster than rehashed rdna3.",Neutral
Intel,"Every Intel marketing benchmark for like a decade or so, but especially their GPUs seem to do far better in their benchmarks than they do in reality.",Positive
Intel,"Ice lake, Alder lake, Metor Lake",Neutral
Intel,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive
Intel,"For business apps laptops have been good enough for 10 years now, iGPU and battery life is really the only differentiator.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel is plenty competent for gaming, and has XeSS which is way better than FSR3.",Positive
Intel,Lol? No 6 or 8 core 3dvcache laptops and no 5080 or 5090 laptops. Strix Halo is a joke for gaming as well,Negative
Intel,The 9955HX + 5070Ti is $2240 and the 275HX + 5080 is $2540.   When both 5070Ti configurations are on sale they should be the same price.,Neutral
Intel,My mistake I was thinking of Strix Halo,Neutral
Intel,"It's about compromise. I don't *want* a 4lb laptop. I don't want a laptop that runs hot when web browsing. Or a laptop that has loud fans, or gets poor battery.  I have a desktop for gaming and other demanding tasks. For a laptop, I, and most of the market, want it focused on portability. Light weight. Cool running. Long battery. These big iGPU PTL laptops are really interesting because they provide *good enough* gaming without sacrifice to the non-gaming livability of the device.",Neutral
Intel,"It took me way too long to convince my sister the AMD laptop I bought her isn’t going to blow up in her face and lose all her data, the Intel(and now Apple) CPU brands are very strong.",Neutral

Intel,"its always ""fix it next generation"" with AMD.",Negative
Intel,This is unfortunate news  (╥﹏╥),Negative
Intel,"I mean yeah it's not ideal, but you could argue it's the same with XeSS or FSR 4 on RDNA 3. Since the OP said ""there's no decent upscaling on AMD handheld"", therefore I assume Opsticaler is out of the question too.",Negative
Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral
Intel,"> Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core   There are SoC and platform level targets that depend on a lot more than just clock speed for the same cores. Consider how LNL's PMICs scale vs FIVR/DLVR. Or what operating point benefits the most from the on package memory.   Especially at really low power, the cores are not your big concern. Consider the difference at 10W between 50% of your budget available for compute and 80%.   > so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores   We're talking a couple percent. DKT is a tick.    > and better process node   Very much unproven.    If you want to give credit somewhere, pretty much all of it should go to the SoC and GPU teams.",Neutral
Intel,"Xe2, Xe3, etc. are the ""real"", more accurate names. Battlemage, Celestial are the marketing names.  Intel's decision to label the new Xe3 iGPUs as ""Battlemage"" is certainly an interesting (odd) choice - my best guess for this decision is that next year, Xe3P discrete will launch alongside Xe3P iGPU in NVL, and they're saving the new Celestial naming for that launch event.  Xe2 -> Xe3 is the bigger change.",Positive

Intel,"They also might be getting better value out of the ""2x scaling"" choice for benchmarking. Notice how they are behind Nvidia in all the none scaled titles except Dota2 that I saw.  Still very good results for a iGPU, but they are not entirely honest numbers either.",Neutral
Intel,It's 1 game out of 45 in geomean which devalues outliers. ~~9.9% faster instead of 10% faster if you take it out.~~  Edit: Oh no it's actually 6 FPS on the 4050. Yeah that's way too big for geomean to smooth out.,Negative
Intel,And the fact they showed 45 games shows how confident they are in this product.  I remember the Intel slides with 5 hand picked titles we used to get just a few years ago.,Positive

Intel,"Not really sure. I believe it's Hammer Lake that's debuting the Nvidia tile, and that's rumored for a 2029 launch, so still quite a ways off, and 2 generations ahead of Blackwell.  The only rumors I'm aware of that it's going to be a pretty big iGPU",Neutral

Intel,Fantastic -- but at least six months too late ;),Positive
Intel,You don't like graphs with zero scale claiming their latest 100W GPU is somehow a gazillion percent better than a 4090 or something?,Negative
Intel,Wattage limited 4050 to 30 watts is the only slide that’s suspect.  It’s around a 41 percent performance loss based on Time Spy from the 140 watt 4050.,Negative
Intel,I think they meant that the chip is very pricey which sucks because the handheld is already low-margin otherwisr and can't be priced too high else it got undercut by its competitors.,Negative
Intel,The standard 4Xe models use the extra die space they save to have more PCIe lanes. that large iGPU adds cost and doesn't make much sense to use that chip if you're gonna add an Nvidia dGPU,Negative
Intel,"yeah just looking at the game sample I can see a few that really don't perform well on RDNA architecture at least relative to nvidia(idk what really constitutes an ""intel favoured"" title)   Like stalker, csgo 2, civ vii, dying light the beast, and delta force ik run a lot better on nvidia relative to amd so im guessing the same holds true for intel vs amd.   A couple titles amd does well in were thrown in there too though like God of war and Cod but im guessing the real performance difference is more like 40-60 rather than the claimed 70-80.

Intel,"Please provide a **single** example in the past ~5 years of an Intel marketing benchmark that is materially inaccurate or untruthful.  NVIDIA is the one playing it loose with BS charts, AMD generally has a good track record (with some exceptions), and Intel on the GPU side has been pretty accurate. For example, these benchmarks have 45 games (!!) and use geomean to reduce outliers.

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

I think AMD is more common in the plastic crap box design and may be a better value there, but those also typically seem to have a ton of older rebadged processors instead of the newer Kraken Point unless something changed.",Neutral
Intel,"I enjoy reading your optimism. I hope it all comes true, but it sounds a bit too good to be true given the recent hardware developements. The 5090 scaling issue is that we stopped resolution scaling. If you go beyond 4k the 5090 scales a lot. VR resolutions report the 5090 being as much as twice the framerates of 4090.",Positive
Intel,I've rewritten prev reply to provide more info.  I'll also link the scheduling patent here in case anyone reading this thread is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2)   It sounds like gains in workgraphs scenarios will be be even greater.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
Intel,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative
Intel,"Interesting, GN usually gets Tom to do discussions like these but instead decided to publish whatever that previous video was on 'Intel pulling an Nvidia'. I bet GN will probably have their own video with Tom, but I appreciate DF a little bit more with this discussion.  At around 21min, it's interesting to hear his talk on cross-vender SR, mentions how they'd like to work more on Nvidia's Streamline and a candid talk about DirectSR and how it isn't really the concrete solution for the work on cross vendor SR. At around 23min, Alex brought up something interesting about research they've published before on joint denoiser and SR. He kinda skirts around it, but continues on suggesting they have more plans on it. He also then continues on the state of PT, DXR 1.2, obviously it isn't a real focus with something on their iGPUs, but any future HW, will be their primary goal to tackle. Alex mentions Valve/Linux, and Tom says it isn't entirely their focus right now, at least for gaming.",Positive

Intel,I feel like more people paying more attention since the market’s grown a lot.   I remember old games I played in the early 2000s having micro and regular stuttering depending on the game. I chalked it up to “huh guess it’s loading in data as I play” when I didn’t know much.,Neutral
Intel,We are paying more attention to it but I suspect as we push higher frames with new engines and techniques the micro stutter is getting worse. It just starts becoming less perceptible to people than say the micro stutter from SLI and other stuff that caused issues in the past.,Negative
Intel,"I think digital foundry answered that question on their podcast. Compared to 15 years ago the frame rate is higher on average for most gamers, but it also stutters more. So it's huge fps with huge drops and hangs.",Neutral
Intel,"Worth remembering no one even gave a shit about stuttering enough to measure it until someone at I think it was anandtech back in the late 00s was so fed up with shitty perf on his crossfire system he started doing 1% lows on benchmarks.   Back in the 90s people would run like 6x SLI voodoos and not even care that the game hitched every 10 seconds down to sub 30s fps lol...  Edit: it's also key to remember that a lot of the games that stutter on PC these days stutter in the exact same places for the exact same reasons, and worse considering the lack of CPU power, on consoles.

Intel,also more cause for stutering. Back then we could compile shaders real time with no siginficant issues because they were small. Now we have to compile shaders real time that are huge to the point where we pre-compile half of them before we even start the game.,Neutral
Intel,Console gamers *of certain genres* care.   The FGC rejected the idea of playing Street Fighter IV & MvC3  on PS3 because the Xbox 360 port had better input latency.   Even the PS4 port of USFIV wasn't liked.     Part of why I stopped going to tournaments is because SFV & Tekken 7 on PS4 always felt *off* compared to PC.,Negative
Intel,"Not really. In many cases, console versions of games just don't stutter whereas PC games do because modern games are mainly designed for consoles and then ported to PC.  A couple of good recent examples are Wukong and Outer Words 2. Neither of those games on consoles have the horrid stutters that are prevalent on PC.",Neutral

Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days.

Intel,4 pcores  8ecores 4 lpcores..,Neutral
Intel,"Geekbench’s scaling has always been problematic, and the differences between architectures are huge. The benchmark is very friendly to ARM and least favorable to AMD. Even a random Apple M5 chip can easily score close to 20,000.  Therefore, cross-architecture comparisons using Geekbench scores have little real meaning. The only valid reference is **same-generation, same-architecture comparisons**, such as between the 285H and 388H.  Based on the actual results, the improvements are about **9% in single-core** and **21% in multi-core**. Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?  This is what really matters. If the 388H can achieve 2**0,000 at 35W**, **22,500 at 60W**, and **24,000 at 80W**, then that would represent massive progress. It would also strongly indicate that Intel’s 18A node indeed offers significantly better energy efficiency than TSMC's N3B.",Negative

Given that the 285H scores around **22,500** in Cinebench, I estimate that the 388H should be able to reach roughly **24,000**.  But the key point is **power efficiency at lower power limits**. For example, if the 285H needs around **80W** to reach 22,500, then the real question is:  * How much power does the 388H need to reach 22,500? * How many watts does it take to exceed 20,000?

Intel,"It’s obvious that this is the viewpoint of an outsider. Professionals would never look at it this way. Professionals first evaluate a processor based on its specifications, features, and process technology. Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake are *not* using some outdated process — they use TSMC’s then-most-advanced N3B node, Intel’s first time adopting it. Meanwhile, Panther Lake uses Intel’s own **18A** process.  Based on the current benchmark results, Intel’s 18A appears to outperform TSMC’s N3B by at least the same margin that **Intel 4** trailed behind N3B — which is an astonishing result.  Every day you hear people saying how much TSMC has advanced, how far ahead its processes are, how “outdated” Intel’s nodes are, how AMD’s processors using TSMC have excellent efficiency. These kinds of statements have been repeated endlessly over the past decade.  Yet today, Intel is using its newest process node to **clearly surpass** TSMC’s top process from just one year ago.",Neutral
Intel,"the real test will be how many watts the X9 388H needs to achieve its scores, because the 285HX needed like 90 watts to achieve its scores  so if the X9 could hit its scores while on its base TDP (65 watts) then thats a \~40% increase in efficiency, not bad",Neutral

Intel,Geekbench runs common workloads as they are commonly implemented. It gives you a score on how well a multi core implementation of that workload would actually run in that CPU.   I think that is far more useful than some perfectly parallel workload measuring max power and core count.,Positive
Intel,"I have carefully compared the various models across Geekbench, PassMark, and the differences between Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake, and Lunar Lake. If my judgment is correct, the theoretical peak performance of the 484 in Cinebench R23 should reach around **24,500**; the 285H scores **22,500**. Compared with the 285H, it should be easier for the 484 to achieve high scores because its power requirements are significantly lower than the previous generation built on TSMC N3B.  Its peak performance will not be extremely strong because the frequency is not high. IPC is likely improved by around **10–11%**, but clock speeds drop by about **6%**. Overall, that means single-core performance should only rise by **4–5%**.  The improvement will be most noticeable in Geekbench. Since PassMark single-core also shows gains, the IPC uplift and resulting single-core increase should be quite certain. If Geekbench were the only source, it would still be questionable, but PassMark is more solid and has higher reference value.  Overall, in terms of peak performance, the uplift is average—around **10%**, close to that figure.  However, the real key is the **efficiency gains**. I believe they will be excellent. Compared with the 285H, which requires **65 W** to reach **20,000** points in Cinebench R23, I estimate that the **388H** may only need **40–45 W**.  I also estimate that the Cinebench R24 score should fall around **1300–1400**. Compared with Qualcomm’s X Elite 2 at **1950**, there is still a significant gap—but the two products differ drastically in scale.  Overall, Panther Lake’s greatest achievements lie in several aspects:  1. **Energy efficiency** — likely the best among all x86 products. 2. **Performance per mm²** — excellent. For example, the 484: if you look at its die shot, the total area of the CPU (including the CPU tile’s 4P and 4 LPE cores and all caches) is essentially equal to the die area of a traditional monolithic 8-core design. That means the 484 uses the same silicon resources as past 8-core chips, yet **no AMD mobile 8-core processor surpasses it**, either in raw performance or efficiency. 3. It also offers better performance-per-area than Qualcomm’s processors. The X Elite 2 has **18 cores**, including **12 “very large” cores**—similar in size to Intel P-cores—and **6 large cores**, each larger than Intel’s E-cores. The die area of this chip is **2.5× larger** than Panther Lake 484’s.",Neutral

When it refreshes the tree it asks connected devices if they are online, including the HDDs. Now move the window back and forth between your screens.

Second is the memory itself, they need something with higher bandwidth (but that might be addressed with LPDDR6).  To address the bandwidth issue they often need to put on extra cache, the 12Xe3 core is basically maxing out the bandwidth of the 'standard' chip, and if they went to say 20Xe3 cores (which would be 4060+ level) then they would need a bigger memory bus and more cache (Strix Halo put 20mb of MALL cache to try and address, and a 256 bit bus) and that is more design work.  They'd also have an issue with the socket - the APU would be too big to fit into a standard socket and would need a custom one which means a custom motherboard which increases costs.  Another is heat - while more efficient overall, all the heat is in one spot so the computer needs to be thoughtful about moving that out.

Intel,"Way we should think about it in my mind is that it's got 12Xe3 cores, and 1 Xe2 core = 2 RDNA 3.5 cores.  Strix Halo has 40 RDNA 3.5 cores (though with a bigger bus and enhanced cache) which is kind of like 20 Xe2 cores (maybe a bit more), and Strix Halo basically ties with a 4060.  If you assume a 5-10% improvement from the architecture going Xe2 to Xe3 to offset the bus and cache (which isn't *as* limiting with only 60% of the hardware), then you're probably at about 60% of a 4060 power, which is more or less where this looks to fall.  4060 mobile passmark = \~17,400  4050 mobile passmark = \~14,300 (81% 4060)  60% 4060 mobile passmark = \~10,500  3050 mobile passmark = \~10,100  That puts it pretty much at a 3050.  With a little sprinkle of cutting edge upscaling and a bit of frame gen it'll be just fine for light titles, but won't be a dedicated monster.  It's just a good solid chip for light-weight long-battery general purpose use that can play some titles on the side (or play older titles with confidence).  I suspect it'll review pretty well, since the reviewers tend to be excessively games-focused and this will appeal, but it's not a games machine - it's a surprisingly zippy long-life chip that's a good fit for all-day laptops.  EDIT: 8060S (Strix Halo) is \~18,000 for reference.  EDIT 2: 890M (strix point's top end) about 8,100, so the PTL 12Xe chip will smoke that.

Intel,"Panther Lake is pretty much a pipe cleaner, so it should still improve a bit.  Then again it has long been said that 18A is supposed to be a relatively low density, high frequency node due to the very good voltage control enabled by BPD. If that is the case, it will only really be allowed to shine in high powered desktop and server chips, while power limited chips won't be able to reap as many of the benefits of 18A, since laptops tend to target the efficiency sweet spot, rather than clocks.  My understanding is that 18A will scale much better with extra power than N3 and N2. Once you pass the sweet spot, 10% extra performance on N2 might take 30% extra power, while 18A should continue to scale much more linearly for a good while longer.  So while it may be an N3 competitior in low power chips, it should be much closer to N2 in high powered ones, especially in use cases where SRAM density is less of a concern. AFAIK Intel CPUs aren't as cache-dependent as AMD, so SRAM density might not be the highest priority, whereas slugging it out with AMD and trying to beat them on frequency might?  From what I've heard, Intel is still just about matching AMD in terms of IPC, while Arrow lake is very efficient, just not great for gaming. If Intel wants the CPU crown back, simply pushing more power could go a long way in clawing back the deficit, assuming 18A does indeed scale well with more power. A 10-15% frequency advantage would go a long, long way towards closing gaps if it comes as a relatively small power cost.",Neutral

Intel,">I can't say I'm entirely sold on the idea of having three core clusters humming inside my laptop.  From a user's perspective, CPU's are a blackbox and the inner-working details are irrelevant. What matters is results. They want, typically, a balance of performance, battery life, heat / fan noise, and cost, placing greater emphasis on one of these categories over the others.  The idea is that P cores = performance optizied  E cores = Area optimized  LP-E Cores = power optimized.  The theory being to have different core types focus on different parts of PPA.  E cores and LP-E cores are the same microarchitecture. Just LP-E cores are off-ring so the ring (and rest of the cores) can be powered down in light-load scenarios.  Intel's biggest problem is that looking at each of the cores, the P cores perform their designated role the worst. 200% larger than E cores for \~10% more IPC and \~15% more clockspeed is a pretty rough trade off - and by the time you've loaded all P cores and need to load E cores too, that clockspeed difference diminishes hard.  Intel's better off (and all rumors point this way) to growing the E cores slightly and making that architecture the basis of the new P and E cores (like Zen vs Zen-C)",Neutral

With fewer thermal constraints and much higher power budgets, they should be able to push well past the perf/W peak, where it should continue to scale well and for a long time before it starts hitting severely diminishing returns.

They are for sure also much more limited in power-budget and frequency, but they can be very fast in general. The main usage is being able to disable the large cluster in Idle or low cpu usage to heavily reduce power draw.     The communication in between the clusters is much slower. So anything that relies on synchronisation and communication between cores is only really fast (latency-wise) if it is kept within the same cluster.      The LPE cores therefore can be very fast actually, but only if the task stays within the cluster. Modern demanding games will therefore 99% soley run on the large cluster, because they would run slower if they spread across all of them.

You can find an i7-9700 for half that and while it's 50% faster multicore, it's only 10% faster single core and most games just use one or two cores, but there are exceptions: research which games you play to check. Fortnite and Arc Raiders can be CPU bound, so the i7-9700/K might help you out a lot with those games, or really any open world, multi-player type game.

More VRAM the card doesn’t have = higher PCIe bandwidth need = more bottleneck when you don’t have bandwidth  A cheap upgrade like an R5 3600 + B550 board would not only improve CPU performance substantially coming from an old 4c4t CPU, but give the GPU the PCIe 4.0 it needs.

It has a 181W PL2 so you need a board with good power delivery to not throttle it, especially if you want an upgrade path. The cheapest DDR4 boards you can get right now that fit the bill are $140.  5800XT is $219 new and $150-170 used. AM4 boards are still cheap, there’s plenty of quality B550s for $100.

Both of our ideas coexist. selling his current pc for more than its worth and just buying a dirt cheap 2nd gen ryzen with a sane gpu for the same money, then upgrading from there is also perfectly correct. That is a similar level of effort to a platform swap, or whatever you would prefer, which is also correct.

Intel,"I’m making the reasonable assumption that the person running a 9100F + 6500XT in 2026 doesn’t have a ton of money to spend on upgrades lol  Upgrading the current platform makes no sense without also upgrading the GPU. You can’t get very far with CPU upgrades on an H310 board, anything higher than an i5 is gonna be throttled.   Swapping in a cheap PCIe 4.0 CPU + board like an R5 3600 + B550 will improve both the CPU and GPU performance while not spending a ton of money. It also opens the door to future upgrades to something like an R7 5800XT which will hold up far better with a GPU upgrade.   I gave you multiple reviews showing 20+% losses on PCIe 3.0.

This process is much simpler and has the potential to grant equal value if the chip is recieved for a low enough bargain, increasing the chances of finding a dreal given limited time. Do we disagree that we are both good at selling advice? I am still completely debating the validity of your sicituational understanding of pcie bottlenecks in relation to low cpu power circumstances, partially because of ur choice of sources, and ur disintrest in confronting that statement.

Intel,Happy to help!,Positive
Intel,DDU ?,Neutral
Intel,You shouldn't be getting worse performance at all. Did you run DDU to uninstall your old Nvidia drivers? Often switching from Nvidia to AMD and vice versa can cause issues like this.,Negative
Intel,most shooter games rely on cpu and your running a 2018 cpu with a 2025 gpu not really a big problem just prob being bottlenecked you also may be running arc raiders with nvidia settings while using a amd card,Neutral
Intel,"You're cpu bottlenecked. You can increase graphics settings. This won't increase your fps, but it might improve stutters and it will give you free graphics improvements.",Neutral
Intel,Is the GPU at 100% utilization?  Are you vram limited?,Neutral
Intel,"yes, nothing change after DDU or Windows Reinstall",Neutral
Intel,"i already trying this too, same FPS on LOW and EPIC",Positive
Intel,"You can also set a fps cap, lower it a bit until you no longer see stutters.",Neutral
Intel,fps cap can't help because FPS are going to 45 to 70 to fast,Negative
Intel,Then you just need to set it low enough. Otherwise you'll keep facing stutters.,Neutral
Intel,There is no way this setup runs battlefield 6 on more than 60 fps,Negative
Intel,All them cards will work fine with your motherboard. The pcie generations are not that much of a issue in actual performance. The issue I do seeing u having is CPU not really keeping up. But you can go up too 5000 AMD just flash your bios before hand. 3080 GPUs are good at 1080 and 1440p. But you will have to upgrade PSU to 850w. You can upgrade GPU first and see if your happy or not and than upgrade CPU later. The 5060 will use less power than a 3080,Neutral
Intel,"You may gotta think also that your CPU seems to be a possible bottleneck cause.  I researched, and as long as your motherboard has a **rebar feature**, your above PCIe gen GPU should work fine. For this, you gotta update your BIOS.  So said that, I'd advice you to upgrade your CPU to a 5600/X and to look for an used GPU, like a RTX 2600 12GB! And maybe to play in 1440p.",Neutral
Intel,Pls dont forget iam talking about 2k gaming. 😊,Positive
Intel,Whats the price of a 9060XT 16GB there?,Neutral
Intel,"9060xt 16gb?  If not maybe 7700xt used, 7800XT used, 4070 used, 6700xt used or 6800XT used. Those are some good options that are above 8gb of ram I believe",Positive
Intel,"tough spot to be in, the PSU is holding you back from the better value GPUs like the 3080. Not many GPUs you can actually upgrade to because of the PSU with only 1 8pin(daisy chain doesn't count). I think upgrade the CPU, then when you can upgrade your psu, then get a 3080.",Negative
Intel,I’m running a Ryzen 5 5500 with an RTX 3060 eagle and it’s been pretty much able to handle anything I’ve tried playing. Considering I got the PC pre built for like $700 then replaced the graphics card and slapped in a second SSD it wasn’t too bad.,Positive
Intel,You will benefit a lot in esports titles by getting a secondhand 5600(x) for your CPU!  The thing with newer NVIDIA cards in the 60-tier is that they use x8 lane configuration and therefore PCIe 3.0 will be somewhat of a bottleneck.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KkRibhp7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8KkRibhp7A) the 4060 Ti is a very small upgrade over the 3060 Ti in an ideal configuration. I couldn't find a PCIe 3.0 1440p benchmark but the 3060 Ti should be able to perform closer to its max due to its x16 lane configuration.,Positive
Intel,"How much do 6800(xt) 6900xt, 7700xt or 7800xt’s cost? Or a 3070.",Neutral
Intel,Smart guy,Positive
Intel,"U sure if i get 5060 8gb it will be fine ? Its the cheapest option of them anyway and i like it so much cuz its the newest , if i upgrade to ryzen 5 5600x no problem then?",Positive
Intel,"144 fps at 2K is insane even if you max out every slot that your motherboard and the cooling system can handle. Without the X3D CPUs, you are nowhere near avg 144 fps. However, consistent 60-75 fps is possible.",Neutral

Intel,"If 510 works, that could be tempting. What about 5060Ti 16GB? Any other GPUs around that price?",Positive
Intel,"maybe in more CPU bottlenecked games, but you will not see a large improvement. GPU also holding you back. If possible, maybe do the upgrades altogether, you will see a good improvement that way.   My recommendation is to wait for a price drop/deal for CPU and PSU, then look for the GPU.",Negative
Intel,"I teuat u man but u r the first one who say this , everyone else said its a big no and 5060 is a disaster on gen 3, i hope u right though",Negative
Intel,"Actually, in FPS games, your prior is the CPU instead of GPU. Due to the nature of those games' engines, you will benefit most for stronger CPU. You just need an average GPU to render competitive settings.",Positive
Intel,"Thats 560, high for me , i mean can get both cpu and gpu upgraded with this",Positive
Intel,"GPU pricese are going up thats why i think this way , thanks a lot 😊",Positive
Intel,I'll look into it,Neutral
Intel,Oohh damn the 5060 are 8x buss not 16x so that's weird with pcie 3. Maybe you shouldn't get one for that motherboard I dint know they cheaped out with the buss lanes on them. You need to get a card that's 16x buss lanes for pcie 3 not to be a issue,Negative
Intel,"i dont think i understand that totally but yeah thats what i was told xd , so i just stick with the 4060 ti?",Neutral
Intel,"So think of lanes if traffic, I'm sad to say even 4060ti is 8 lanes too but has much more vram so it'll be less of a issue than the 5060 because your less likely to run out of vram. I saw that you said you do plan on upgrading motherboard? The 5060 runs into issues with 3.0 pcie boards when the vram runs out meaning it needs to overflow into ram more. The 16gig on the 4060ti less likely run out. You can upgrade in steps.",Neutral
Intel,"Mmmmmmm I don't know how to tell you , but iam talking about the 8 GB version of 4060 ti too :D",Positive
Intel,With your budget don't settle for a 3060. Go to Andromeda insights and checkout their 5070ti or 5080 builds with the 9800x3d. You can get them for $2100 - 2500.,Neutral
Intel,"1. The NH-D15 is a massive waste of money. Something like a Thermalright PS120SE will cost about 1/4th as much and perform about as well, plenty good for a 9800X3D  2. I’d consider a cheaper board depending on your needs, you probably don’t need any of the features of a B850 over a cheaper B650  3. RAM pricing is awful. Get a 2x16 6000c36 Crucial Pro kit for $273, the slight timing difference isn’t gonna be noticeable on a 9800X3D - the additional cache substantially reduces the impact of RAM on performance  4. SSD pricing is bad. Get a 2TB GameStop SSD for $170. Sounds weird, but it’s just a rebadged Lexar NM790. Solid drive and plenty good if this system is primarily for games  5. You don’t need that insane 1300W PSU. An 850W Montech Century for $90 or 1050W for $110 is more than enough for this build even with a substantially better GPU  6. You don’t need to buy a Windows license at retail price, there are ways to get around that pretty easily  Dump the large amount of savings into an actually good GPU",Negative
Intel,"Specifically for the license, you could always get it online for way cheaper haha.",Positive
Intel,"If I could make a swap between 2 components, it would be the PSU and 3060TI FE.     But even if GPU performance doesn't matter, it's too overkill where system draws around 400watt even in peak..",Negative
Intel,"I really like the build but u are definitely overspending in a few places here that PSU is extreme overkill but I do like when people get more wattage than they need, if u are looking for quiet then u should check out the ID-cooling A720 its half the price for 99% of the cooling and just as quiet  for a 3.5K budget u could get a 5070ti no problem and its ever so slightly slower but there is cheaper RAM out there. other than that I like what u got here  [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VJDMGJ](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/VJDMGJ)",Positive
Intel,I personally won't choose 'FE' cards unless temps/performance being expectedly worse is fine with you.,Negative
Intel,Get a cheaper cooler cheaper ram cheaper PSU cheaper SSD and get a 5070ti. Spending 3.5k and getting a two gen old budget card is insane. This  [list](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Photonman1/saved/#view=v87WBm) is better,Positive
Intel,"the cooler is a waste of money and the 3060 ti 8gb is a card that should be $250, not $465, u can probably find a 9060 xt 16gb or 5060 ti 16gb for the same price, and if u get a cheaper cooler and psu you can allocate even more budget to the gpu. 1300w is a lot for your build, even an 850w will do perfectly fine.",Negative

Intel,Thanks for the input! Something you'd recommend in its place?,Positive
Intel,"The SSDs you recommended are 2230, not 2280, and won’t even mount on the motherboard you recommended. A single 4TB GameStop SSD is $320 and solves that issue  Spending $65 extra on 6000c30 over 6000c36 (2x16 Crucial Pro is $274) also seems like a waste of money for a 9800X3D where you’d never notice the difference",Negative
Intel,I wouldn’t recommend 6400c32 as out of the box compatibility beyond 6000 isn’t 100%  Get a GameStop 2TB (rebadged Lexar NM790) over the parts bin UD90 for $20 less,Negative
Intel,"In my country (Singapore) it very big haha, the official sell around 200 iirc but Chinese sellers for even 10~20",Positive
Intel,Just spend 2 bucks on a 2230 to 2280 adapter.,Neutral
Intel,Fair point.,Neutral
Intel,"Or you could also just get a drive that actually fits instead of using adapters, is cheaper price/TB, and offers better performance - high-capacity 2230 drives all use lower-power controllers and QLC NAND",Positive
Intel,"The 9060 xt should be 30-35% faster than the b580 depending on games and resolution. To me, that's definitely worth a 14% increase in cost.  8 GB does mean the card won't age as well, but it doesn't mean the card is suddenly worthless. There are very few games where 1440p simply won't run on 8 GB of RAM. With the RAM crisis only going to get worse, my hope is that developers will put a little bit of effort into optimizing vRAM usage.  (edit: and based off your pricing, the 16 GB should only be about $50 USD more. That is probably worth it because not only will it perform better now, but you'll get a couple years longer out of it, and it will have higher resale later.)",Positive
Intel,"VRAM usage is based on your resolution, mostly, in conjunction with game settings at that resolution.  If you plan on gaming at all at 1440p, do **not** get a card with 8GB of VRAM. This isn't a future issue, this is a now issue. It currently does not have enough vram for 1440p gaming in nearly any new heavy titles, including battlefield 6 (just as a recent example).   Hell, at 1080p my 8gb card was over capacity on battlefield 6. There's an argument to be made that it isn't enough for future 1080p gaming as well.  Can you do plenty of gaming on an 8gb card? Yes. Can you run every game at max settings? No, not even on 1080p. You'll have to turn settings down. Which frankly I'm in the boat of ""not usually a big deal"", but it's not good when you pay 300+ bucks for a new piece of hardware that can't run your games at full tilt.   It is more powerful than the B580, yes. The B580 will last longer because of VRAM, also yes.   My suggestion is really think about how long it will be until your next upgrade and make your decision based upon that. Longevity, go with intel. More power now for just a couple of years (2 or 3), consider the 9060XT/5060 (at 1080p only, skip entirely for 1440p). Or look at their 16gb variants.   You could also look at used options. You can find a 6750XT 12GB for 200-250 USD typically, as an example.",Neutral
Intel,"in that price range I think you can find good used deals. also maybe take a look at the rx 6800 xt (or generally gpus from 1 or 2 generations ago). I have one since 3 years or so and works like a charm (you will lose fsr 4 compared to the 9060 xt, but it has 16gb vram and better performance) in my country (in central europe) I saw some sold for about $250",Positive
Intel,"It depends on what games you play and refresh rate not just resolution.  As you mentioned, it's not just a matter of the amount of VRAM, otherwise a 1070 or 1080 Ti would still be used -I bring it up because I just upgraded from a 1070 :)  I would spend the extra $40. I think the RX 9060 XT 8GB would also have more resale value.",Positive
Intel,16gb,Neutral
Intel,"9060xt 16gb, is the one you should get if you are planning for 1440p in the future. Get that one that future you will thank and appreciate in the long run.",Positive
Intel,"definitley wait and save up for the 16gb of the 9060xt, it will be worth it",Positive
Intel,If you're on PCIe 3 the 9060 is the only choice here.,Neutral
Intel,"So recently I bought a new prebuilt that came with a 5060 TI 8GB. For my old system, shortly before, I'd purchased a 9060 XT 16GB.  I haven't had an AMD card in many a year, and I was inclined to be generous to NVIDIA, thinking ""Hey, they've got DLSS, they've got multi-frame gen, yadda yadda yadda...""  So I'd been playing Borderlands 4 on my old rig with the 9060 XT when the 5060 TI system came in a few days ago. I tried playing Borderlands 4 on the new PC with DDR5 RAM and a much better processor, and for every game I tried (Witchfire, Borderlands 4), it was a much worse experience.  DLSS frame gen treated me well on my old 4060 so I thought  multi-frame gen would be rad and close the 8GB-16GB gap, but holy shit the lag was like improperly configured Lossless Scaling. It was awful, and I am NOT generally sensitive to latency. I really learned that without enough native frames to feed frame gen, it's not even a feature worth using.  I suspect had my new PC had the 16gb version of the 5060 TI it probably would have run everything as well as, if not better than, the 9060 XT.  As an example, on my new PC with the 5060 TI, Borderlands 4 was running like less than between 35-50 fps native on medium settings. With the same processor, same RAM, but a 9060 XT 16GB, it runs natively in the 70s and 80s on high settings.  Now, I do only game at 1080p, mind you, so that factors in as well, I suppose.  I was a true believer that 8GB was still enough in late 2025, especially with AI assistance, until this past weekend. I would urge you to go with more VRAM. I know, personally, I'll never buy another GPU with 8GB VRAM again after I see how impactful it is.",Neutral
Intel,"The whole vram issue is valid. But, ultimately, all you can do is look at the games you want to play. For the vast majority of current games, the 9060xt performs better and not by a tiny amount. I don't get why you'd take 30% worse performance now for the hope that in 3 years' time you might get better performance.",Neutral
Intel,Especially if 1080p is still your target then I'd go with the 9060 no doubt about it.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm currently researching the exact same thing, except I have a 1440p monitor so am targetting that. Price difference is about the same, too - can get B580 for AUD 400 vs RX 9060 at AUD 480 (though it's a MAXUN brand which I have mixed feelings about, and the Intel is an original Intel ""brand"" and looks beautiful). I'd like to point out two main considerations that I haven't seen others mention:      1. Upscaling quality and performance. As these are low-end cards, we will almost certainly have to use upscaling to get any decent performance for modern games (when you move to 1440p or even if you want to have higher qualities/details at 1080p, depending on your tastes), and XeSS seems superior to FSR. XeSS does work on other cards, but is hardware-accelerated on Intel cards and is apparently almost as good as DLSS. And for games that have upscaling but not XeSS, we can use OptiScaler to replace FSR or DLSS with injected XeSS.       2. Intel cards apparently have hit-or-miss compatibility/performance for older, non-DX12 games, since the hardware wasn't designed to natively support older API's and relies on a translation layer in the drivers. It is being improved over time with driver updates, though, and we also have the option of injecting DXVK (third-party DirectX to Vulkan layer) into games as another option. DXVK is used by the Steam Deck and other Linux gaming, so it should have some pretty decent coverage.  With all this said, even though I do play older games and want to keep that option open, I'm still leaning towards the B580. It still sounds like a solid upgrade over my aging RTX 2060.",Neutral
Intel,"Idk about these specific cards but a few years ago I got a 1650 4gb and my buddy got a 1060 3gb  When he played games the fidelity was great but had some stutters here and there, just cruising at 70ish percent  Mine would be screaming at 99% usage with lower fidelity but boy oh boy was it significantly smoother  I'd go with more vram",Neutral
Intel,"Neither, get the 9060xt 16gb version. Stay away from 8gb.",Neutral
Intel,Tell OP they can get the 9060Xt in 16gb,Neutral
Intel,"I assume you're speaking strictly without any upscaling, which IMO is essential for low-end cards like these. I'm researching the exact same thing as the OP, I am currently on an RTX 2060 6GB yet this card can handle Battlefield 6 at 1440p with Balanced DLSS and all Medium qualities extremely well (never dips below 60) - seems a well optimized game. Still, I'm leaning towards the Intel card, since I can find it for $80 AUD less and XeSS is apparently better than FSR (and we have OptiScaler for games that have upscaling but don't specifically support XeSS). EDIT: Well, XeSS will work on AMD cards too, but apparently it has better quality on Intel cards - I'm yet to look into the facts here. EDIT2: Apparently BF6 is quite CPU heavy, too, so might be worth mentioning I have a 3900X.",Positive
Intel,1080p yes on medium settings. 1440p probably if you turn down all the settings to low. 4K if you like slideshow.,Neutral

However, you really don't need to upgrade right now. I am running a 5900X and a 4090 and playing games on ultra settings with a 4K monitor. I'm not upgrading until at least AM6.",Neutral
Intel,No,Neutral
Intel,"You won't notice any difference except from eSports games like CS, valorant etc. and maybe bf6 but on AAA titles you won't see any major improvements!",Neutral
Intel,"I have both, the only difference is the GPU, honestly.  At that resolution you won't notice much of a difference, unless you want to have a newer CPU later on once they release the 16c single CCD beast in the 109800x3D or whatever they'll call the thing.",Neutral
Intel,"Second one this  The 5800x3D is legendary but the 7800x3D blows it out of the water. I would just sell the 5800x3D for 400$ on eBay, get the combo and call it a day.",Neutral
Intel,"Or list it for $430 and sell it that same day, why take a 20% cut for nothing lol?",Neutral
Intel,"its cuss they dont have the money for the ram, so for them its iethere stay with a 3000amd cpu or the 50003ds",Negative
Intel,Great advice right here OP,Positive
Intel,Fixed. My bad. Thanks,Neutral
Intel,"I was about to say that my 7800x3d roasts all the autocad application I am running cleanly, but then I remembered I got the 7950X3d so I could use it as a home workstation, and my GF has the 7800x3d rig I built.",Neutral
Intel,"I’m leaning towards not doing…tell me if you agree or disagree.  1.) it’s not guaranteed I sell everything for the price I want.  2.) if I do, I’m gaining roughly 8% performance for a $60-$100 upgrade at best? Why go through all that?  3.) I’ll have more of a reason to upgrade when AM6 comes out. And I can just drive there for the deal when they inevitably have it then.  4.) I’m happy with what I have? 🤷",Neutral
Intel,"Resale value on the 5800x3d is insane right now, like $500.  It honestly makes a lot of sense to upgrade now when after selling the old Mobo, RAM, and CPU, the money will nearly completely pay for the entire upgrade",Positive
Intel,"Nothing, I’m just trying to plan for the future and if parts are gonna be through the roof going forward I figured maybe this is a better option to hunker down with?",Neutral
Intel,"I appreciate your comment! However, if you re-read the post I said that I’d be buying the cpu, motherboard and ram combo from micro center. Totally understand that a cpu upgrade would require mobo and ram",Neutral
Intel,Wait you wouldn't sell it?,Neutral
Intel,Legendary in what sens if it’s crushed by a $100 7500F?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, my bad. I came up with that number just to make a point that there are some AM4 suckers out there that will spend 9800x3D money on a 5 year old CPU  380 usd sells in probably 1 hour.",Negative
Intel,"I'm mostly in agreement as there's risks involved in selling.  Maybe the price comes in lower than expected or the buyer disputes.   Looks like the ground is still moving beneath our feet with people posing that prices are still jumping. At least, we are in good situation in that we have a decent setup either way. Happy gaming!",Neutral
Intel,"So, you're basically trying to ""future proof"" because you're worried that when your current setup fails you in some way, the hardware you would've to buy would be more expensive than right now.  That's a bit faulty logic because:  1. Your current setup can easily last you a couple of years without problems. 2. By the time you truly feel a need to upgrade, the current shortage would've ended already and prices would be back to normal. 3. At that time, something else better than 7800X3D would be around and at the same price, 4. 7800X3D, despite how good it is, it's not the future proofing CPU you think it is. If you want something that you wouldn't feel a need to change for a good 7-9 years, then 9800X3Dis where it's at, and that's probably more expensive than what you're comfortable with spending.",Negative
Intel,"They’ll drop eventually, and long before your current setup is obsolete. The AI bubble will collapse, and they’ll dump all of theirs chips back into tue consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"I meant I “would”, it was a typo my friend",Neutral
Intel,"Is it though? Depending on the game, the 7500F does better, but in anything that likes that extra cache the 5800X3D is still amazing. https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/rip-intel-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks-vs-7800x3d-285k-14900k-more for example, literally *every* game they tested, the 5800X3D matched or significantly beat the 7600X.",Positive
Intel,"I love me a great troll  But yes, the 7500f is a fantastic value AM5 cpu and yes trades blows with the 5800x3D. However the 7500f did not start the x3D legacy, the 5800x3D did and for that it’s legendary. Sort of like how a 9060xt 16gb absolutely beats a 1080 Ti, but that still doesn’t make it a legend. It just makes it a good value product for the time👌",Positive
Intel,"I'm sure it can make sense in some scenarios, with the current cost of RAM, but I agree it seems silly to pay that much",Neutral
Intel,"Check eBay sold listings, homie",Neutral
Intel,He might even make money on this upgrade after selling the old parts lmao,Positive
Intel,5800X3D is definitely selling for $400+ right now. I sold mine for ~$100 more than I paid brand new in 2022.,Neutral
Intel,"Gotcha. The 9800x3D bundle is $680. So right what the 7800x3D bundle would be with the board upgrade. So, I guess not out of the question.  But I see what you’re saying. Probably should just wait then. I also don’t see a need for a 9800x3D if I’m just gaming as well",Neutral
Intel,Oh thank God.,Positive
Intel,I think you mean 5050? I have a lot of cpus the 7500F with the right configuration is on average 30% slower than a stock out of the box 9800x3d.,Negative
Intel,The computer market is so weird right now,Negative
Intel,"At the resolution you're playing on, your CPU is highly unlikely to be bottlenecking your GPU. The only scenario where I would consider a CPU upgrade (with your setup) is if my normal PC usage is feeling (noticeably) sluggish or if I'm playing some heavily CPU reliant games where I'm unhappy with the FPS I'm getting. If in your case neither is happening, then there's zero reason to upgrade IMO.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes a 5050 is faster than a 1080 Ti (as it should be and I would hope it would be).  Yep, a 7500f should run about that on average with 1% lows being being even lower than a 9800x3D  The 7500f is a fantastic chip, a lot of performance for the price. Frankly more than enough for most people. What’s not to like and what’s the point you’re trying to make here my friend?",Positive
Intel,Honestly it wasn’t that far off before. This bundle used to be $450-$500 and the 5800x3d used to sell for $300ish.,Neutral
Intel,Appreciate the input! I likely won’t. That’s for the good points here sir! 🫡,Positive
Intel,"In fortnite in particular,   max overclocked 7500f performed as follows: 542avg/289 lows 1%/ 74w power  Stock out of box 9800x3d: 721avg/ 373 lows 1%/ 92W power  Overclocked 9800x3d ( just an undervolt with serious ram oc ) 723avg/ 404 lows 1%/ 64W power.  That’s a 33% gain in avg and 29% gain in lows.   Overclocking the 9800x3d saw virtually no gain in average (33.02->33.3%) but 1% lows jumped from from 33.3% to 39.79% greater than max overclock 7500F   When you consider the hefty premium X3d chips call for, I’d say 7500f is winner all day. 33% difference in fos might sound huge but when talking 542 vs 721fps sure it’s 33% but who cares when both chips already run so fast.",Neutral
Intel,"You're welcome. May I add that right now it's a good time to tune-out of tech news. All you're going to see is doomsaying articles/posts from people trying to generate either sales or clicks.  It's pushing an extreme FOMO narrative because that gets people's attention, but it's not logical or wise.  Good luck with whatever you decide to do.",Negative
Intel,Don't wait. Sell your 5800x3d for $500 on eBay and buy the bundle. You'll never get an opportunity for a nearly free upgrade like this again,Neutral

Intel,I did have a lot of stability issues with amd gpus but I hear gamersnexus saying nvidia have drivers issues on the 50s cards. So keep that in mind.,Neutral
Intel,"I would really look into Intel Arc GPU's, I'm running a b580 with many games at 4k60 max settings (although with AI upscaling in some more recent cases e.g. Cyberpunk with RT and ultra perf XeSS = 55-60+ fps at 4k, no FG needed) it has great support for comfy ui (I'm on Linux for my genAI) and can create 1024*1024 SDXL images in around 2 seconds each and Flux Q4ms (iirc) in around 5-10 sec. I'm not so into LLM's and just use ChatGPT for free, but as far as I can tell it's pretty fast with LLM's as well.  It supports XPU without any issue out of the box if you install the drivers from Intel and I've not seen any issues myself.  So, by only looking at Nvidia you're severely limiting yourself.  Also, as a Lenovo server tech support, I see a lot of companies adding Intel compute units (which are based on Xe cores) to their AI-server clusters as they are way more cost effective and aren't that much slower compared to the Nvidia compute units. All of these servers have no issues running XPU based ML/AI.",Positive
Intel,"Sorry but with this component list, it's not a budget pc. If you want a latest generation amd cpu and an nvidia gpu, that's going to drive up the cost, more so with the price hikes coming up soon. You're also going from a 1050 Ti to a 5060 Ti, but you want to reuse your PSU... Are you sure that's actually feasible? What is the wattage of your old PSU? What condition is it in? Unless you upgraded it recently, I doubt it'll work with those components you listed. It's not an irrelevant detail at all. Please find out before you commit to your build.  That CPU will also likely need better cooling than what you have right now, especially if you'll be doing LLM work on it. Also on that note, your RAM. 16 GB is not going to be enough for this kind of work. It feels like you've gone all out on the other components but bottlenecked yourself there.  Look, a 7800 would be around 100 euros cheaper and still do what you want it to. And all Nvidia gpus are way overpriced right now, but perhaps a 3060 or a 3080 (if you can find a cheap one, just go with the 3060 tbh) would still be within your budget while also being decent for what you want it for.  The motherboard is way, way overpriced as well. You can find excellent options at half the price. That ""minimal"" rig is not minimal at all and you've overlooked some pretty critical points.",Negative
Intel,"Well it's not a Threadripper PRO with 32 cores. So, what would you call a rig with that? Compared with one with 64 cores or 96 cores?  I'm not sure what I've set can be considered as mid though. The diff between 8 core CPU and 32 is kind of...day and night.",Neutral

A cheap \~60 EUR CPU cooler I thought I would just omit, it's like a small detail.   3. I honestly thought it's budget build, but I guess I just don't know the brackets, or maybe I think there isn't an universal gradation for it. I thought my current one is budget, better said ""outdated"".   4. I think motherboard is kinda ""non-negotiable"", I didn't want to cheap out on it, it's for many years to come, I might downgrade CPU/buy cheaper GPU or go with less RAM, but motherboard is there to stay for future upgrades, plus I kinda need a few features from there, USB-C, local network 10 Gb/s Ports (Marvell AQtion)     I don't know if I can change the title now to simply ""I need advice for my PC build"", but maybe I should just get a few more salaries and get something better.

Intel,"It's crazy that the ram is already doubled in price. I guess it's being picked up fast.   The power supply should be good as long as it's in good condition. If you go with the rx7900 xtx, be aware that for optimal use you'll need 3 8-pin connectors. You may be able to get away with 2.   Definitely look into motherboards a bit more. As long as you have DDR5 and pcie 5 support, you're future-proof for current standards. Current graphics cards don't even saturate 16 lanes of pcie4, nevermind pcie5.    Honestly, I would say to pick up the price-critical components (ram, gpu, SSD if you want one) now and save up for the rest.",Neutral

Intel,A few thousand miles? Sorry that sucks. Their bundles/combos on parts are better than sex sometimes.,Negative
Intel,I mean.. CPUs are pretty far ahead of GPUs at least in terms of gaming.   Unless you planned on running 1440 with everything on ultra the B580 is great on most games. You’ll never feel like you are forced to run a game on low graphics.,Positive

Intel,"You'll definitely need to do your own research, but at one point you'll need to install one distro and play with it: see what works for you and what doesn't and if you can find workarounds or alternatives.   I've tried Bazzite and was happy with it. Most likely I'll like CatchyOS and Mint.   For me, the only thing Microsoft I use now is the OS, for everything else I've transitioned to something else: Brave for browser, Proton Mail and Drive, Standard Notes.",Neutral
Intel,"Because I like to play BF6, or the campaign in COD Modern Warfare 2022, last AAA I got during a sale.",Positive
Intel,"Because you either accept that no matter how much you hate kernel access, you only got two choices you either accept it in order to enjoy playing your favorite games or you choose not to allow it preventing you from playing the games you love",Negative
Intel,"Some games with anti-cheat work, some don't. As Linux gaming becomes more popular, game devs will adapt.",Neutral
Intel,Arc Raiders works fine,Neutral
Intel,"Yes, I have had both nvidia and amd graphics cards running on Linux, streaming to both platforms. Also yes I can run the latest drivers if they are available",Positive
Intel,Just dont use dlss 4.5 and you're good.,Neutral
Intel,Say that to the steam deck and most handhelds that support/run steamOS 😂,Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't say dead in the water. Linux is becoming more popular and all it takes is the game developers seeing there's enough market to get them to support anti cheat on Linux.  I think it's a current problem but I'm sure it'll become a non issue in time.,Positive
Intel,I would definitely look into and give it a shot. I had some weird issues using Steam OS where the WiFi would turn off when I started downloading things but that was the biggest problem I had.,Negative
Intel,Easiest way is to have another windows computer and use the microsoft windows 11 creation tool.,Positive
Intel,I get that you enjoy those games but why do you feel comfortable handing out kernel access to your OS?   Do you feel this is a good habit to get into where you hand over this type of access to any program?,Neutral
Intel,I am just very lucky because I don't like any of these aaa games that are pushing this anti cheat. So at this point its been very easy. Cod and BF are trash now IMHO. If something comes along that actually is something I want to play it will be harder but I will still just pass on it.   None of these games are worth keeping windows for. Not even close.,Negative
Intel,I’ll do more research then and not assume. Thanks.,Neutral
Intel,"Interesting, thank you. Probably a simple Google Reddit search about my 3080 Ti + (OS) + (OBS Twitch/youtube streaming) should do the trick.   Someone said some games with anticheat work on Linux also. Guess it depends on the devs.",Positive
Intel,"I meant purely as a desktop box for people looking to play competitive games at their desk with their existing mechanical keyboard and gaming mice, and for the guys that typically only buy call of duty and want to play on their couch in the living room.   For that use case, the Steam machine becomes immediately less desirable unless they can workout something related to anticheat with the specific devs.   For Steam deck **this does not apply at all, nor does my comment**.",Neutral
Intel,"if you have flash drive with usb-c, you can just download windows iso on your phone and extract it to that flash drive, you don't even need creation tool or rufus... I mean it's good to have, it lets you adjust the installation process, but it isn't necessary",Neutral
Intel,I am not the guy but i am speaking for millions of people i think:  - They don‘t care  - They want to play the game,Neutral
Intel,"I simply don't care. My life doesn't revolve around this (Windows vs Linux). These things are so unimportant to me that I don't think about them.   I think if you've asked me when I was in my 20s, I think I would have given you a different answer.   I just moved on.",Negative
Intel,"The biggest anticheat in the world does not have kernel security concerns. Relax buddy. Unless you’re doing some heinous illegal shit on your own computer, most normal people here aren’t paranoid about this stuff.",Negative
Intel,So I suppose it is just ignorance on what it means when you grant kernel access to a game?    Or do you think they still wouldn't care if they knew?   I personally won't buy any game requiring this. That's just a hard nope.,Negative
Intel,No this isn't a Linux vs Windows thing. Stay on whatever OS you want.   I'm just wondering why you are ok giving kernel access to a game? Are you just saying that system security is unimportant for you? Or maybe you run a separate OS install just for games?,Negative
Intel,"You don't need to do illegal things to be smart about security, what a strange thing to say.",Negative
Intel,"I think tons of people know and just don‘t care. If you care and lock yourself out of potentially very fun games, good for you",Negative
Intel,"System security is important up to a point until it gets in a way of actually enjoying life. I believe there should be a balance between security/privacy and usability.   I know Linux people think they have the most secure and most private systems out there, but I seriously doubt it: not talking about the MS telemetry, but what traffic goes out of the system, through your ISP, then what's seen my your own country security and surveillance systems.   I know what I'm going to do: I'll browse with incognito mode :))   I run one OS for everything, one 2TB SSD. I was thinking of going the dual boot route, but I've discovered I need to enable and re-enable Secure Boot anyway so I abandoned that idea.   I'll switch full time to a Linux when I'll be able to run whatever HW I want (no way I'm going back to AMD) and the games I play, run on that OS. For the same reason I'm not considering a Mac. Or I could switch full time on Linux, get nvidia gfn ultimate and play my games that way. But what's the point? I have a 12700KF, 32GB, 3070Ti and soon a 5070. Of course I'm going to play my games locally.   What's the point of locking myself into something that I don't want to use. I know it's popular to switch to Linux these days but let's be real here: it's not always feasible. I know, I know: Cyberpunk and Baldur's Gate 3 run on Linux, that's all I hear from ytbers but other games exists.   I'll agree with you about the AAA vs indies: it's a complete mess. In the last 5 years I can count the AAA games I bought on the fingers from one hand vs indies which I buy monthly.",Neutral
Intel,That's the case for me too: I know very well and moved on.,Neutral

Intel,"I switched to amd this time but I was having good luck with nvidia on Linux mint.   I don't understand pigeon holeing into one brand or the other, it's not a marriage.",Positive
Intel,"Because I don’t want to waste more money. If I switch to AMD and I have problems again, like many 9800X3D users and like myself since 2019 till today, nobody will answer: no techtuber, no redditor, nobody else. It’s money down the drain.

Intel,"My $0.02: get a 5000-aeries chip, upgrade your bios and pop it in. Get a gpu and hope ramageddon ends when you're ready to go ddr5.

Intel,5700x3D if you can find it around €250. 14600/14700k are best all around CPU with DDR4 support,Positive
Intel,"If a microcetner is close to you, you can get a 7800x3d, ram, and mobo for 580 which is unbeatable     If not, I just upgraded from a 3700x to a 5800xt, CPU heavy games still crank away at utilization (like battlefield 6) but in battlefield 6, I saw a 20-30fps increase, and generally a much smoother experience, and am running a 2070 super for reference.  The 5800x is a 'under' (barely) clocked 5800xt, but I only grabbed the xt because it was easy to find and on sale for 160 at the time.",Positive
Intel,Going to be a downgrade obviously. Intel has Been getting to the point those cards are actually good but it’s still going from high mid tier to low tier,Negative
Intel,you got a free game from intel,Neutral
Intel,as a low tier card it's quite decent. i use it to play games at 4k,Positive
Intel,Yep went in expecting a downgrade but I don't game too much lately haven't found the latest games all that good and mainly playing older games at the moment so the trade off for now isn't huge for me.,Negative
Intel,Yep Battlefield 6 key.,Positive
Intel,How?,Neutral
Intel,"Were in ""ITS SO OVER"" Phase of memory calipse, I'm pretty sure arc  580 is weaker than ur ded gpu. So u better get some money somwhere fast. Ssd situation is the same its about to get expensive. In short its so over. Im sad for gamers :(",Negative
Intel,I'd say either get a 9060XT 16GB or get a used 2080ti and call or a day,Neutral
Intel,"Arc B580 is a very decent GPU and if you can buy it at that price you should snap it up.  As for storage, buy it if you can afford it but if you're ok deleting stuff you're not playing or have completed you shouldn't realistically need to.  A second hand 2.5"" SATA drive for additional storage can be added at any time you actually need it.  EDIT: also sell that 1080 ti or repair it. It might only need the solder reflowed and new paste applied (which you can try yourself with a heat-gun and a laser thermometer (there are tutorials on YouTube).",Positive
Intel,The problem with Intel Arc GPUs is that they require newer hardware to work at its full potential   Afaik you need to have a PCIe 4.0 slot and ReBar support   Also you need a modern CPU at least a Ryzen 3000 series on AMD side iirc for best performance   Don't know what CPU gen is needed on Intel side,Negative
Intel,"just found a video(1y old) saying the B580 runs bad on older pc's.  i have a Z370n mobo with and i7-8700 CPU, would i work on mine ? has there been any driver update in the last year that fixes this ?",Negative
Intel,"b580 is around 10% faster than the gtx 1080 ti, has 1 gb more vram and is much newer so better support and it has raytracing cores unlike the gtx 1080 ti. (still wouldn't do such a small upgrade personally.)",Positive
Intel,"i tried the oven trick 3 times, 10min on 200°, 15min on 220°, 2hours on 125°, everytime it works again for a couple hours / days, then black screen again.

Chatgpt says its the VRAM",Neutral
Intel,"silly idea, do the thing again, but mount it upside down so the heatsink pushes the chips towards the PCB?     (no idea if this will actually help)",Negative
Intel,"If baking it fixes it it's something on the board where the solder has cracked.   Pouring flux around and using a heatgun and temperature gun (or baking it) still has a chance to fully melt and reflow the solder if you get it hot enough (but not too hot).  You have a repairable card, at least for someone if not you, so all I'm saying is sell it on based on it being fixable but needing reballed or reflowed at minimum.  Someone will be able to get use out of it once it's fixed, and in the meantime you have some small amount ($?) to put towards the B580, which would be my likely choice in your price range.  There's a guy on YouTube you might have seen fixing GPU's, but he does charge as much as you'd expect to pay for the same card on the second hand market to do the work.  Someone like that would probably snap it up on eBay and fix it for selling on, but I totally understand the work he does that we can't do is pretty serious knowledge and experience at work and you or I probably aren't up to tackling it.",Neutral
Intel,"You are using an F-series CPU, those don't have integrated graphics which is why you can't get a signal from the motherboard. You need to have your GPU plugged in and you need to have your display cables plugged into the GPU to get a signal.",Negative

Intel,Nice! How's 4k on the B580?,Positive
Intel,"I would rate it 8/10. That looks like too much thermal paste and the space is a little cramped, but your build is unique!  I just did a new build and I might go with a green color scheme this time around, last battle station had a red scheme.",Positive

Intel,Remove it before it falls in the fan and fucks it up.,Negative
Intel,I'll believe them (either Intel or AMD) when I see the benchmarks.  Until then this is all just pointless noise.,Neutral
Intel,well yeah you can't compare them because strix halo is on a signficantly larger die wheras panther lake is more comparable to something like the hx370.   If amd is able to get strix halo at a competitive price then sure it will compete but the issue is that with such a large die I don't think it is possible for them to compete in price with panther lake,Neutral
Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.  Also, AMD forgor Strix Halo laptops are still nowhere to be found aside from 1 or 2",Neutral
Intel,"AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs. They're slacking off on that stuff trying to focus on data center. Hope that works out for them.",Negative

Intel,Idgaf when Strix Halo products are nowhere to be seen (notebooks),Negative
Intel,"Except that the B390 will be far more common as it will be seen in far more laptops. Yes, the 8060S & 8050s can be found in some laptops, but for the laptops you'll find in places like Currys, Best Buy or Mediamarkt, the B390 will be the most powerful iGPU you'll likely find & it'll happily outdo a Radeon 890M",Positive
Intel,"AMD is at the point where Intel was before they went down the route and are recovering, history repeats before it's too late.  Not going to believe either until we get actual benchmarks and results.",Negative
Intel,Meanwhile AMD keeps putting out new chips with years old GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,Core Ultra 2 is already a better mobile soc.  I don't know why AMD thinks 12-16 cores is more important than battery life when it comes to laptops.,Neutral

Intel,Lot of markets and Intel did bribe the oems for decades and still do,Negative
Intel,The Intel igpu has a better upscaler by far. FSR3.1 is a third class competitor in comparison. People have been crying out for AMD to release FSR4 for RDNA3.5 but AMD has some seriously stupid execs in charge.,Negative

Intel,Don't they already have an integrated GPU that's on par with an RTX 4060? According to Framework?,Neutral
Intel,"strix halo is nice and all, but too prohibitively expensive to be considered for many people  arc b390/b370 will be available in much cheaper products for which amd doesn't have a proper answer to atm. amd's next lineup can't be lazy if they want to stay competitive",Negative
Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.   If intel keeps on chugging away and they work with all the DirectX games backwards and going forward.   I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.   Hopefully they can release a true dedicated GPU back in rival something that's out there at a much better price that will bring at least some competition back until the AI scam is over.",Negative
Intel,They should be worried about DLSS 4.5 though. Fix stuttering on FSR 4 and improve image quality,Neutral
Intel,I just wish Intel would make a very cut down panther lake offering to be the successor to the N1xx/N3xx line of efficient chips that have found their way into mini PCs.,Neutral
Intel,amd unfazed? I bet they are talking big shit again then will get absolutely demolished (as it happened with vega too),Negative
Intel,"Yeah it's old architechture, that's the point, Intel moved to the lastest node and barely manages to eek out a win. A win is a win nonetheless, but AMD still have plenty to dials to turn up.",Neutral
Intel,"I don't understand the fuss about iGPUs? Like why do they assume the average Joe would care about an IGPU at all? That's maybe 5% of the market and even then...most of them would get a dGPU anyways.  And apart from the GPU, what's special about the CPU? Combining (Lunar Lake) efficiency with (Arrow Lake) power? Sorry but my Ryzen AI 7 350 does that already. The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.    And the AI 7 350 was designed as a Lunar Lake competitor anyways so it was never worse in efficiency and ahead of Arrow Lakes like the 255h in that regard.  So I don't see why anything should really change...?",Negative
Intel,"AMD doesn't want to bring RDNA 4 to APUs, so as not to give FSR4 to users other than those with dedicated GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,a brand new product on a newer node is better than an older product on an older node?! who knew?,Positive
Intel,"And the price. I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand. Hope Intel gets back into the game and if Intel can slash their prices it might end-up being the right choice.  At the same price, Intel is dead on arrival. At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"Well lunar lake is a monster and competes directly with the z2e both on performance and efficiency, so no reason to think panther lake will be worse.  Even if it falls short of Intels claims it will still be the leader until next year.",Neutral
Intel,Plenty of folks tested it at CES.  Intel was confident enough to let reporters run benchmarks and it's basically around 4050 level.  You should be able to run most games at 1080p at medium-high settings in an Ultrabook form factor.,Neutral
Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral
Intel,The noise is doing a great job advertising for them. A war between them with fighting words will get them tons of free advertising.,Positive
Intel,And a much higher power budget.  AMD says they win because their 120W chip is faster than Intels 45W chip.   No surprise to anyone.,Positive
Intel,"I generally agree but i suspect that the 388h is using a much larger gpu than people suspect. I think its probably ~165mm2 in size, not 55mm2. i suspect the 55mm2 die varient is for the 4xe version, and the 12xe version is 3x that size.  I also dont understand why strix halo is so expensive. It would be interesting to see bom and packaging costs.",Neutral
Intel,"It sounds like RDNA4 just doesn't scale at all. All the rumors point to them going straight from RDNA3.5 to RDNA5 in APUs, just skipping RDNA4 all together.",Negative
Intel,RDNA 3.5 was the only reason I didn’t invest in a STRIX HALO mini PC. The price is too much for outdated unsupported tech.,Negative
Intel,"Might be the same reason they stuck with Vega for so long in APUs.  At the current available desktop memory (DDR4 at the time) an architecture change wouldn't have made a huge difference.    Once DDR5 came out for laptops, we finally saw RDNA 2+ APUs (Ryzen 6000 APUs).  I'd bet once DDR6 starts appearing on laptops we'll get a similar iGPU architecture leap.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD probably just didn't bother making a new APU design when they didn't have new CPU core to go with it. Medusa Halo is rumored for 2027 with Zen 6 and UDNA/RDNA5, so the Point version will likely release then too.",Neutral
Intel,AMD has and always will be their own worst enemy,Negative
Intel,"It's not like they aren't developing something this whole time, releases are planned many years in advanced. Intel will have some rope and then will get inevitably leap frogged",Neutral
Intel,It's not like Intel isn't doing the same. Panther Lake and ARC are holdovers of things developed under Gelsinger.,Neutral
Intel,"> AMD is going to f--- around and let Intel catch up, in CPUs and GPUs.  this is what we actually need: competition. AMD kicked intels butt, now intel is kicking back. it's a win for us either way.",Neutral
Intel,I hope Intel will catch up and encourage AMD to compete. Having cleat leader in CPUs or GPUs is bad for consumers.,Negative
Intel,"I mean, we know that AMD is innovating. They literally showed Zen 6 at CES. Its just not ready yet for mobile, and Intel caught up. Same thing happened with Alder Lake, where intel released that before Zen 4 was ready.",Neutral
Intel,"So AMD having much faster iGPUs for decade or more did not do much.  But now Intel rolling out something at unknown price/power package will absolutely decimate AMD.  Regardless of what will happen, ""AMD's fault"" indeed. (amazing silicon designers and experts at everything posting for free on reddit have convinced me)",Negative
Intel,"Laptops haven't really been AMD's focus, and apart from Zen1, AMD's focus has been mostly on data center, with desktop being the natural offshoot.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah they ain't immune to being complacent.  And bad press doesn't make Intel stay bad.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, their leaders aside from Ms. Su are all holdovers from AMD almost bankrupt times. Software sucks, graphics sucks, and now they are taking CPU down the drain too with high prices. Shitty leaders, lead to shitty outcomes.   They post high useless benchmark numbers no one cares about. They cannot compete with Apple in terms of battery life, and get creamed at low power levels.",Negative
Intel,"so either AMD doesn't have the capacity to produce them, or OEMs aren't interested, neither option is a compelling reason for AMD to focus on mobile",Negative
Intel,"We’d wish they were, but they’re not. Intel was struggling on all fronts due to their fabs. Amd is actually moving super fast in data centre so both epyc and instinct which is where they believe their money will be. They just don’t care to do anything in the consumer market.",Negative
Intel,"Halo is so much faster that the upscaler difference doesn't matter at all. Of course, it is probably also bigger.",Positive
Intel,"Yes, Strix Halo",Neutral
Intel,And having fsr4 supported in mobile at all,Neutral
Intel,FSR 4+ may be great but game support (number of titles + GPUs supported) is embarrassingly low,Negative
Intel,Dlss 4.5 not that great in my opinion. It fixes some ghosting but creates more shimmering because it has so much sharpening. I had to dial back to 4.0.,Negative
Intel,wildcat lake.  only issue it seems to be using 2 P cores and 4 LPE cores instead of E + LPE,Neutral
Intel,70% faster being “barely eke out a win”? Go ask why amd is stuck with 18 month old architecture despite intel managing to replace arrow lake after 12?,Negative
Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.   Being power efficient opens up a lot of form factors to be able to game with such as thin and light laptops, tablets, or gaming handhelds",Neutral
Intel,"Absolutely consumers win when competition is hot, AMD has a bit too much of a lead ATM so they are cashing in and getting lazy. That said I am glad they are having their day, only because a few years ago they were on the brink of bankruptcy and I really want to see them on a fairly level playing field with Intel... If we end up with 2 juggernauts training blows, having big resesrch budgets, etc we'll get lots of innovation and competitive pricing.",Neutral
Intel,"> I used to be an AMD fan, but as soon as competition with Intel was gone, AMD raised their prices and now act as if they believe they are a luxury brand.   That's why it's silly to be a ""fan"" or ""supporter"" of one company or the other.

At a serious discount they will take the place of AMD. No one is buying Strix Halo for handhelds, it is too expensive.  Outside of that one device (Ayaneo maybe?), you're right.  But now AMD is also releasing an 8-core version of Strix Halo with the full 40 GPU CUs, which should be cheaper.  I expect that we'll see that in more handhelds at the high end.  Realistically speaking, it's easy to make the case that on a 7""-9"" screen the 40 CUs is way overkill.  There's still room for a middle ground that Intel could easily fill.",Negative
Intel,"You had to shovel $1k for a 8 core CPU for about a decade, before AMD came.  So ""it just hiked the price"" is BS.  AMD cannot keep prices low while TSMC, effective monopolist, keeps posting record profits quarter after quarter.",Negative
Intel,AMD is basically just waiting for their chance to do the bad things. They are a corporation after all.,Negative

Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.

Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.

Is there any truth to my hypothesis that Play Station PC ports are likely to be relatively well-optimized for AMD GPUs, given that the Play Station 5 itself is indeed some variant of RDNA? I recently got a 9070xt and have been overall very impressed, but its achilles heel seems to be ray tracing. This isn't exactly surprising to me, as I researched my GPU options to death before buying one, and the general consensus is that Nvidia is stronger in the ray tracing department. But if I were to boot up, say, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, a game that supports ray tracing at 60 fps on the base Play Station 5, could I expect it to perform better than a similarly demanding game that wasn't particularly optimized for AMD hardware?  It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect. But I just haven't really heard much discussion of what, if any, overlap we get optimization-wise for games that were optimized first and foremost for the AMD-based Play Station 5.",Neutral

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears.

Intel,Ok I thought I was the only one having the enhanced sync issue because no one replied to any of my posts about it. I use it because then I can lock my fps to 120 (on a 4K OLED TV) and use enhanced sync instead of Vsync because of the screen tearing when locking to 120. Now I have to do the frame lock to 117 which is fine but just annoying me I'm missing out on 3 fps lol it was causing issues in a few games where it would stutter like crazy and it all came down to enhanced sync.

Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux.

RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.

Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

Intel,Still not working AMD NOISE S,Negative
Intel,New Game Support: ARC Raiders  I updated to this driver thinking it would be better for ARC Raiders since that is what I am playing right now but my game is crashing if I try to load into the Blue Gate map. I tried restarting my computer and it still happens. I almost lost all my gear because it took me a bit to roll back my drivers to 25.10.2. Come on AMD do better! It's a supported game on this driver! I surprisingly never had crashes in 25.10.2 unless I toggled the Adrenalin game overlay.  Running a 9060 XT and a 5900X.,Neutral
Intel,"I updated from 25.10.2 and saw the bug report tool pop up after restarting. I had no idea what caused it. I launched Battlefront 2 and the entire system froze, with WinAmp trying to play audio which sounded horrendous. I uninstalled Adrenalin, used DDU to clear everything then did a fresh install of 25.11.1.  On restart, the bug report tool showed again. This time Wallpaper Engine failed to show on the second monitor. I quit the program and started it again and boom - system freezes entirely.  So, this driver apparently has big issues with Wallpaper Engine. Uninstalled, DDU'd, fresh install of 25.10.2 and smooth sailing ever since.",Negative

Intel,"I started having an issue since the 25.11.1 update with unreal editor where all of my tools menus instantly close, nothing else changed except for this driver update and I've heard of Nvidia having similar issues with driver updates in the past so I think it may be the cause, Going to revert to an older driver and see if it works",Negative
Intel,"I've spent the last few days uninstalling, reinstalling, DDUing, doing everything I could think of to get Adrenaline to start/work. It would show the splash screen and then quit. No way of re-starting it. Couldn't open anything that used Vulkan and got errors. Couldn't install the Windows Store version cause ""driver error"". I eventually used DDU one last time and uninstalled everything AMD and was able to just install the driver through MyASUS. Now I'm able to open all the software again that wasn't starting before. I'll be holding off on installing Adrenaline again anytime soon. Sucks cause I want the features, but I couldn't use the programs anyway. I miss having nvidia.",Negative

Intel,Last driver crashes Apex Legends every joined game. Im fuckin over amd.,Negative
Intel,Support for Anno 117: Pax Romana - Incorrect. I have needed to downgrade back to 25.9.2 to play Anno 117: Pax Romana without crashing. The last updates have been a joke. I now cannot use adrenaline due to needing to play on this earlier version to be able to play any new games. Does anyone know of where I can express my complaints?  Edit: This is also the same for Arc Raiders.,Negative
Intel,"Here we go again, jetzt stürzt Battlefield 6 wieder ab. Mit dem Treiber davor hatte ich es in den Griff bekommen außer XMP war aktiviert, dann stürzte es dennoch ab.    Also es scheint definitiv ein AMD Treiber Problem zu sein.    Gut das bei euch die Kunden die Tester sind und nicht ihr das übernehmen müsst.  PS: Gespielt wird mit einer 7900XT und einem 7800X3D.      Das war definitiv meine erste und letzte Karte von AMD. So viel Probleme hatte ich mit Team Grün nicht.",Neutral

Intel,"I have this but on display port, HDMI works fine",Neutral
Intel,"DDU with full uninstall of all AMD related things and then chipset driver install, fresh GPU driver install fixed the crash from wakeup for me.",Neutral
Intel,"I had to go back to version 25.9.2 but I no longer have AMD Adrenalin. If I try to install it, it reinstalls version 25.11, which crashes my game. Is it necessary to have AMD Adrenalin? I have a 7900 XTX and a Ryzen 9 7950X3D.",Negative
Intel,Could you try a DisplayPort to HDMI adapter? I wonder if it works in this situation =D,Neutral
Intel,I have the same issue with display port but it’s okay with hdmi :/,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral
Intel,"V25.10.2  here… I have both CPU and GPU by AMD and if you download the specific package, they install drivers only for the specific hardware (and they have different dimensions). For installing both drivers you have to download the AutoDetect package.  EDIT: typo",Neutral
Intel,"I'm one of the 5 people still running a Vega 64 and for years we've had a separate driver ""branch"" despite being able to install new Adrenaline versions. Bf6 beta wouldn't run without spoofing my actual internally installed driver, which hadn't been updated since they dropped support.",Negative
Intel,combined again it looks like 🤷‍♂️,Neutral
Intel,the display team are working on this with priority. Hoping to have this out in the next release. There are two similar display issues on their radar which are both P1.,Neutral

Intel,"Are y'all playing on televisions? HDMI isn't really optimal for modern monitors, with DisplayPort being the better spec for computer graphics.  Not criticizing, just curious as to use-case.",Neutral
Intel,You try install last chipset driver ?,Neutral
Intel,"Bummer you're having issues. Hopefully AMD gets it straightened out for you. Out of curiosity, why did you decide to use HDMI on your monitor instead of display port? I thought HDMI was mostly used for TVs nowadays.",Negative
Intel,So it's the driver that's why that happens 😡 and it's not fixed?,Negative
Intel,Thank you for your service,Positive
Intel,"I've had the ""device_hung"" error and the best drivers are those you are on.   AMD needs a lot of help with their drivers...",Negative
Intel,Any update mate?,Neutral
Intel,"No, radeon drivers update cannot upgrade your CPU so that it would stop bottlenecking your GPU.",Negative

Intel,I'm playing it on 7900 GRE with FSR4 INT8 with no issues.,Positive
Intel,na it works the problem only occures when using PathTracing and you are not going to play on an AMD card with PT anyways and especially not a 7700XT,Negative
Intel,"I played recently the latest patch of Cyberpunk 2077 with RX 7700 XT with drivers from February this year, 25.2.1 and had no issues, no stutter, no lag, no crashes, the problem is with path tracing or ray tracing something, you don't have to use that even and it lowers fps probably for very little visual gain.",Positive
Intel,If it still crashes set RTX Global Illumination to Static.,Negative
Intel,"pretty sure anti lag was causing my system to freeze up when in arc raiders on 25.10. turned it on and issues, turned it off and haven't had issues since",Negative
Intel,"Optimizing has nothing to do with fixing crashing, generally, that would be bug fixing.",Negative
Intel,"The only Redstone component that will work through the driver for upgrading existing features (like FSR3 FG) will be ML FG, but only for games that have FSR 3.1.4+(and FSR FG), as they’ve already announced in a GPUOpen article quite a while ago.   Ray Regeneration (RR) and Neural Radiance Cache (NRC) require dev implementation since they’re much deeper in engine code/inputs.",Neutral
Intel,"Does BO7 have ray tracing? Where is that feature mentioned, would be keen to read about it 🤓",Positive
Intel,"Itll probably work through optiscaler, but a game like indiana jones has locked dlss inputs, so you need dev implementation",Neutral
Intel,"And all my USB devices dropped for a while, far worse experience than the usual double screen flicker & it's done.  Edit: seems like that was because of iGPU driver for my Zen4. In the end and after 6+ reinstalls, I'm stopping on 25.9.1 and have Vulkan working again.",Negative
Intel,What is wrong with CP? Just got my 9070 after 10+ years of nvidia :o   Ah nvm i see it.,Negative
Intel,Ugh,Neutral
Intel,"Most likely when your distro provides a kernel update.  I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral
Intel,"Linux doesn’t work like windows. You get updates directly via Mesa stack. When your distro provides mesa package update, that’s when you get driver updates, and they’re completely different from windows branch.",Neutral
Intel,just uninstall it I prefer manual check myself.,Negative
Intel,So AMDs default driver overclocks and doesn’t reflect that in the values?,Neutral
Intel,Same issues here i underclocked it but this new update just made it worse,Negative
Intel,ok it is still crashing ... complete reboot :(,Negative
Intel,"I feel like that crash is more on DICE's side, since Nvidia users get the same exact crash, although less often.  I tried everything I saw on the internet, nothing really works. Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet. Never had such a long session without the game crashing.  Will update in the next few days.  Edit 2: haven't crashed once, been playing at least 2 hours every evening.",Negative
Intel,Okay.,Neutral
Intel,I’m hoping Valve’s new steam machine will push them on that since it’s RDNA3 based.,Neutral
Intel,The RT/PT reflections leading to CTDs issue? We're working with CDPR to resolve this - it's not caused by the driver software.,Neutral
Intel,"Stuff like this is honestly bugging me.  First AMD card and while it is okay to have some driver issues, stuff like that shouldn't be a thing at all. It can't be that some bugs keep existing for multiple months let alone more than half a year.",Negative
Intel,A much more fundamental thing like playing video in a window without stuttering took 3 or 4 driver updates.,Neutral

Intel,welcome to amd,Positive
Intel,Yeah hoping it works. I guess the point about crashing with easy anticheat was the fix? Doesn't specifically mention but it was with raytracing enabled I was getting the crash. I suppose we shall find out.,Neutral
Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.  My fan control profile broke and stopped tracking gpu temp so last night I did a clean DDU install back to 10.2.  Of course 12 hrs later the new release drops haha  Hopefully Fan Control continues to play nice if I just update",Negative
Intel,Same. Never even had Ryzen master installed.,Negative

Intel,The new AFMF features were added in 25.10.2 - Still waiting for AFMF 3.0 at this stage,Neutral
Intel,Suggest if you are using powertoys to stop... After their last game update it was crashing left and right. Powertoys was cause. I only crashed once and I believe it was cfeen blanking was cause for that. I was away too long.,Negative
Intel,"Fps drop over time? That's a game issue, it's got a memory leak",Negative
Intel,"What kind of FPS drops? I was having dog shit frame pacing, and hardcore drops to like sub 60 FPS at 1440p medium/high with a 6950XT. I went through every setting and found that anti-lag was the culprit. Once I turned that off it all went away. Then with future frame rendering it got even smoother.

Intel,are you able to install driver only with the newest drivers? When i choose minimal or driver only it still install full version of the software anyway. Only 25.9.1 works perfectly.,Neutral
Intel,Yeah... it can happen. I was already locked outside windows after a bsod with my old nvidia card. I had to use a linux usb drive to fix it through the command line.,Negative

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.   While digging into my issue, I wanted to see if DP2.0 / uhbe20  compatible display would have these issues, but my current display only has HDMI2.1 and dp1.4.  Hopefully someone else had experience with them on 4k 240hz.",Negative

Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP.

Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative

Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Positive
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.

Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.

Intel,"Hi. Sorry, I thought this was pretty common as I've had this issue with two different systems and 3 AMD GPUs across 2 generations.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral

Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral

Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Positive
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral

Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Positive
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it.

Intel,"Brawndo has electrolytes, that's what plants crave!",Positive
Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

Intel,That's awesome!,Positive
Intel,"Yes, but SLI is a bad description for it.",Negative
Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.  (assuming we're talking about games)",Negative
Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative
Intel,"There is not really a clear limit. More PCIe bandwidth makes scaling efficiency better, less means the software will run a bit slower in multi-GPU mode. 3.0 x4 (~3.3GB/s) is just enough for reasonable efficiency.",Neutral

PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Positive
Intel,So Nvidia now has the lowest driver overhead? Seems like they took the HUB video seriously,Neutral
Intel,So the money you save on a GPU you will need to spend on a better CPU??  Might as well get a faster GPU.,Negative
Intel,Interesting that B580 doesn't look bad at all with a 13600k. I wonder what it's like with a 13400 or 12600k. It seems like just having those extra threads provided by the e-cores takes care of the overhead it needs.,Positive

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative
Intel,"Lowest with DX11 and older, but not with the newer APIs",Neutral
Intel,And when is the last time HUB did a dedicated video showing the improvement in overhead?,Neutral
Intel,or it's just a cache/memory access issue,Neutral

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Positive
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at?

So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable.

So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W.

Intel,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it.

Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.   That said, I have no idea how close the iGPU is to being bandwidth bottlenecked at 1080p. But I very much doubt doubling it would also double the frame rate.",Negative
Intel,"I wonder if Valve would be considering Panther Lake for a Steam Deck 2.

Intel,It's hilarious to think Steam would work with Qualcomm.,Neutral
Intel,"Very unlikely. Proton and DXVK work alright with x86 but adding ARM conversion on top is, uh, a **very** poor experience.

Amazon [literally warns potential customers](https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-powered-surface-laptop-7-gets-frequently-returned-item-warning-on-amazon) about it.  Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances. Anything that can increase incompatibility rate (and it VERY well can, ARM **does not** support AVX2 natively for instance meaning [a lot of games that might have issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1dekmtz/avx2_game_list/) even starting or underperform).",Negative

Intel,"Even more efficiency that doesn't exist yet. Snapdragon elite can do some heavy workloads for several hours at a time, but it's not powerful enough for heavy gaming. Valve says they know what they want, it's just not ready yet. I think as great as Panther Lake benchmarks are, the biggest complaint of the Steam Deck is still the 2ish hours of battery life in more demanding titles.

Intel,"That's a bit of a different case, because they are designing a new product either way they might as well look into supporting something like LPCAMM2. They already have a mainboard for the FW13 that can support these newer CPUs, so there has to be a very compelling reason to spend money to redesign that, which I think a single Intel SKU is not unfortunately.",Neutral
Intel,Do we know if we are getting real Nova Lake mobile chips or just a BGA version of desktop parts with a panther lake refresh?,Neutral
Intel,"The DRAM standard between LPCAMM2 and LP-DDR5x is the same - that's the point. LPCAMM2 is a replaceable implementation of LP-DDR5x memory.  But LPCAMM2 is completely different from SO-DIMM. SO-DIMM is DDR5. LPCAMM2 is LP-DDR5x.  You will see Arc B390 designs with LP-DDR5x memory down on the mainboard, and you'll see (some) LPCAMM2 designs, but they'll be far less common.  But you won't see DDR5 SO-DIMM designs - if they claim to be DDR5 SO-DIMM and Arc B390 then its wrong.",Neutral

Intel,"It's not exactly weird. They went PPC before Intel because powerpc was more effective for workloads most people used macs for. The switch to Intel was just because Intel had node leadership and performance leadership. Instead stick to A-chips for low power mobile where intel gave up on servicing. Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

(FOR ME, competitive in 2026 means <400€) From a performance standpoint, it would need to undercut existing GPUs quite aggressively to make sense, especially given how crowded the mid-range already is.  That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.  So unless Intel is willing to take a serious hit on margins (which seems unlikely), I’m not convinced the B770 will land at a price point that truly shakes up the market.

Intel,"I feel like the price has to be more than competitive. If they can undercut competition cards of the same performance by 100 or so (or maybe offer rebates or freebies) they could potentially steal the market in that category.

Intel,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
Intel,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics. However, the system manufacturer has designed their BIOS interface to prioritize stability and user-friendliness, often managing advanced PCIe features like ReBAR automatically in the background rather than exposing manual configuration options. This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

Intel,"While I haven't used it daily or anything, and I've only done initial setup on the Lunar Lake, the feedback we've gotten both on Arrow Lake and for Lunar Lake (e.g. 268V and 265H) Dell models is that it's a big increase in battery life and performance. The integrated graphics (e.g. 140V and 140T) are very capable compared to a **workstation** grade NVIDIA Ada 500 GPU, but they are not even comparable to a gaming GPU like the GeForce 4060 or even a 5050.  The integrated graphics do however get used for 99% of all workloads unless explicitly specified because they are vastly more battery efficient and draw less power compared to a dedicated NVIDIA chip, meaning you can have a much smaller external power supply, and your graphics performance in those basic desktop workloads with one of these chipsets will be **much** better than previous generation Intel chips. Exceptions are obviously something like gaming or AutoCAD that specify to use the high performance dedicated graphics chip.  140V/140T are barely functional for modern AAA gaming, but if you stay 5-10 years back for AAA titles you might be okay. It will smoke most Indie games. Just look at the per title benchmarks for a 140V/140T and you can see if your game benches. You could probably get away with a lot of functional mobile gaming without a dGPU, but I wouldn't expect to be able to play a recent Call of Duty or Black Myth or anything with anything like an acceptable framerate at a decent resolution. This integrated graphics chip compares very favorably to its more common Ryzen 7 equivalent, I believe the 780M, and it's a very good APU for handhelds overall due Lunar Lake's power efficiency compared to other X86 chips.  You have to understand that for these next two generations Intel seems to be making big strides in terms of both power efficiency and integrated graphics for mobile, it's a very attractive option and the first time I've seriously considered a laptop without a dGPU. I think Panther Lake is going to be a very nice kit next year for both laptops and handhelds and give AMD a run for its money.   I suspect AMD genuinely needs a new APU graphics architecture implemented next year to keep up, which I expect them to. Not a bad problem to have.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.

Intel,I don't see anything wrong with asking for actual benchmark information especially when there isn't anything official. X3D is nice but it isn't the end all be all. I would be curious to see if Intel can manage to compete.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh I totally agree, but it would've been nice you know? Jumping to 6 Xe3 is a  significant area increase for a tiny tile. I understand exactly why the 4-10 gap exists, but I can't say I don't wish there was something to fill that gap if only because it looks weird.  I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,CGC is a LNC tick. This is well known at this point. And we see it's even a clock speed regression.    Even entertaining the notion it will close the gap to AMD's X3D chips is just delusional.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh, yeah, I get you. Wish they could give more granularity. Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.  Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral
Intel,"Two options seems right, either you care about it or you don't.",Neutral
Intel,"Its not ""delusional"" to want to see actual numbers instead of speculation. I have been in this game long enough to see plenty of speculation even with accurate information not give the actual numbers.",Negative
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,"> If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP, though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  Not guaranteed given it's just a twitter leak, but I'm assuming the leaker is using the term TDP consistently with Intel's historical usage, i.e. PL1. For ARL, 115W is PL2. I would also assume there wouldn't be the disclaimer about it being hard to cool if they cut the PL2 so much, though PowerVia does create some interesting complications there, so maybe not quite apples to apples.  Either way though, don't think it should have much impact on ST boost. You're talking a good 70%-ish of power going to compute, so even at 65W PL2, that's still 40-50W available for one core. Should be *easily* sufficient to hit whatever the silicon is capable of.  > It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system.  Yes, and this is something I've very much looking forward to with NVL-HX. At this point, the biggest demerit of the -HX platform vs -H is the use of standard DDR5 vs LPDDR. That's because it's still based on the desktop silicon with the different SoC/hub tile. But with NVL using a shared SoC die, they should be able to offer an -HX platform with the core counts people expect (though probably limited to single die 8+16), but the power/battery life advantages of -U/-P/-H. In general, should help make the -HX more of a straight-up upgrade than the tradeoffs one faces today.  AMD has this situation even worse today, because there's a much bigger gap between their desktop SoC architecture and the mobile one. Though as you say, they may also bring them closer together in the future.",Neutral

Strix Point at launch had little products (Asus being the only OEM per usual) and yet they still continue to grow, at a smaller scale relative to Intel.

Intel is really dependent on CCG, it is double in revenue to DCAI. They invest in what makes them money. Compared to AMD, client and DCAI is doing well, for client CPUs and GPUs are doing well, putting no pressure in mobile, in fact their strategy has remained the same in the past couple the years and even if marginally their % share is sufficient for them. Intel pushes a lot of supply for mobile, while AMD is smaller, it is all relative in the necessary investments they need to make in order to supply demand.

The only aspect Intel kind of messed up that annoys me is their video encoder, once it gets pegged to 100%, it absolutely tanks your performance on the capture to the point where it skips frames and lags. It never used to do that and the driver also used to include capture software, now they just offload it to people having to download OBS and removed the capture aspect of the driver. Kind of dumb when both NVIDIA and AMD include it as a driver option.",Negative

In practice, it'll be more like trading 2 P cores for 4 lpE cores  edit: to be more specific, In ARL-H, below 5W per core, E cores outperform P cores.

I bet AMD makes good money on PS5 (and Xbox X/S), Sony & Microsoft just subsidize the shit out of it with their 30% cut from selling games. Even the Steam Deck is barely profitable for Valve. High-end APU is just a waste of sillicon.",Negative
AMD,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips. But if you want true performance, just go out and buy an RTX X060 series laptop it's far better price to perf each generation.",Neutral

From their database, the next most recent thing with RTX 4050 they reviewed was the Yoga Pro 7 in January 2025 with a 60W RTX 4050 (45 watts + 15 watts Dynamic Boost), which scored 50.8fps in Cyberpunk 2077 at the same setting and thus a bit lower than the AIO, so I would say the AIO is at an okay spot for a RTX 4050 to be compared to this Arc B390.",Neutral

Yes, they are different product classes, but Panther Lake SKUs that have 10-12 Xe3 cores will most definitely be >$1000 with laptops. ""Mainstream"" pricing is subjective in this class, unlike GPUs where there are 5060s and 5080s segments. At CES, there are surprisingly dGPUs still being paired with Panther Lake, heck, Strix Halo was designed purely for it's iGPU, even the engineers stand by this (PCIe slots are being released in miniPCs because that's what the market wants).  Also, this ""big APU"" argument is based on chiplets/tiles. Strix Halo isn't monolithic, same as Panther Lake. They both have the same design strategy that makes it economically viable to tape out in the first place.

Tossing something like a 5700/5800X3D into your existing system looks fairly attractive at present for that sort of user if they can bring those back at a reasonable price point.

AMD,One that conveys a massive disappointment and fear for the future of hardware.,Negative
AMD,"AMD would need to redesign the memory controller to be compatible with DDR4 and motherboard makers would have to make DDR4 AM5 motherboards. Easy, technically speaking. But then that redesign, tape-out, validation, etc. all takes time and costs lots of money. DDR4 can cost just as much as DDR5 and it doesn't seem like DDR4 supply will go anywhere but down, so this effort would only make sense for the budget-oriented people reusing the RAM they already own. And while the RAM situation is horrible, it's not going to last forever. It may take several years for the situation to ease if things continue the way they are. Or the bubble may pop next week and take memory prices down with it.  So the biggest consideration is money and whether AMD thinks it's worthwhile to spend it chasing a pretty small market that may no longer exist by the time product is available.",Neutral
AMD,"Would make more sense to go the other way around, design new I/O die and then put Zen5 on AM4. The way you said would need new chipset, new motherboards and a new I/O die. Putting it on AM4, in theory all you would need is a new I/O die.

We're in a small window where it's actually a good time to upgrade if you live near a Microcenter.",Neutral
AMD,"But that's more due to lack of demand and retailers happy to let their stored inventory dwindle as they predict demand will only further reduce. If people actually start buying it again it'll shoot up as new supply would be near nonexistant.

AMD,"Regular Zen3 is still great for gaming, it just gets overshadowed by X3D (for good reason). Hardware Unboxed recently did a comparison of several different Zen3 CPU's.  Also keep in mind many CPU gaming benchmarks are done at 1080p or even 720p with something like a 4090. In reality, for a budget DDR4 build you're more likely to use a much lower tier GPU, while running games at 1440p (1440p monitors are nearly the same price as 1080p these days) so the difference won't be as exaggerated.",Positive
AMD,"That's not a 'big' step up.  That's a pretty mild step up.    Most people dont upgrade their CPU every new generation, and that's basically all this is effectively.  The only real consolation here is that Zen 3 CPU's pass muster in modern games better than Zen 2 CPU's do.

AMD,How are your USB ports and wifi/bluetooth?,Neutral
AMD,"First gen was flaky for a number of reasons.  Another is that many people who bought boards for Zen 1 were shit out of luck if they wanted to upgrade to Zen 3.  Zen 1 was also fairly lackluster in terms of single thread performance, and main selling point was really just being able to have a 6 or 8 core CPU at a more affordable overall price point.  Which was great dont get me wrong, but Intel CPU's were still pretty clearly faster in almost all cases at the time for gaming.  Zen 2 was AM4's real arrival in my opinion, helped a lot by Intel stumbling off a cliff at the time.  But if you got in with Zen 2, then your upgrade path was ok, but it wasn't half as miraculous as people make it out to be unless you went for Zen 3 Vcache parts specifically.    AM4 was definitely good and worthwhile, but there's certainly a bit of overselling the narrative here.",Negative

AMD,"Assuming intel also keeps those mobile CPUs a good price, this could be really good. Hopefully as well they add the B390 in their high power desktop CPUs, seeing a core ultra 5 with an iGPU like this would really mitigate the need for a dedicated GPU right away Mostly because iGPUs on other generations were bad, and only a select few Ryzen CPUs had the 890M.

Are ya prepared for a gaming handheld that costs north of $1500?

AMD,"With everything happening around NVIDIA´s price increases and AMD´s lack of providing updates where it hurts, it **feels like** AI-Datacenters are more important right now for them (like the last 2 years).  But who can resent them as Intel had products that where not so much competitive that time.    Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.   Now let them release a B770 that is rumoured to be fairly mid/high range and we can hope for competition that actually learned from bad products recently and tries to make it better.",Neutral

AMD,What do you mean that a refreshed Strix Point can’t compete with an updated architecture?,Neutral
AMD,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
AMD,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.

AMD,"I'm just curious how they handle the need for such high speed RAM on desktop though? I guess this is an application where CAMM2 will be required, I don't think DDR5-9600+ is possible without it and this is presumably pretty key to the performance.",Neutral
AMD,"It certainly would make a huge difference because iGPUs are very memory bandwidth bound; and as the name suggests, LPDDR5 9600 has literally twice the bandwidth of the JEDEC standard 4800.  Unfortunately I doubt we'll see reasonably priced laptops with LPDDR5 9600 -- even as an add-on option. I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800; and many SKUs that were 2x16GB are now 1x16GB; yes **single channel**.... they charge you extra if you want 2x8GB.",Neutral

AMD,??? lunar lake has already shown to be faster than the 890m.  73 percent though seems like a bit much since panther lake was claimed to be around a 50 percent increase over lunar lake,Neutral
AMD,Example?,Neutral
AMD,"They did make a graph specifically to compare the performance of HX 370 and this Arc B390 while they were both using 2x upscaling, which is where this 73% number comes from.

AMD,"No, intel claims 73% with upscaling (both) and 82% native",Neutral

AMD,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
AMD,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral

AMD,AMD is planning on again using RDNA 3.5 on their next mobile chips as well.,Neutral
AMD,Not an ideal solution but Optiscaler exists,Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA has increased margins but they haven't been that terrible. Part of the compounding issue at play is limited TSMC capacity; with both gaming and DC on the same TSMC node.

AMD,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
AMD,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient.

AMD,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
AMD,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.

AMD,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
AMD,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
AMD,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
AMD,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
AMD,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Positive
AMD,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
AMD,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
AMD,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
AMD,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
AMD,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Positive
AMD,They're a lot more accurate than whatever the fuck Nvidia has been doing where you have to decode their bar graphs for proper scaling lmao,Negative
AMD,"I'm pretty sure Intel threw lots of ""marketing money"" for the MSI Claw too.

AMD,> Lunar Lake was a expensive product which didn't make sense in handhelds   What do you mean? All the tradeoffs LNL made were pretty good fits for a handheld.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think that will really be an issue, laptops can be configured with soldered 8 channel RAM like AMDs Z2 extreme, or they can still manage easily with regular DDR5 6400Mhz sodimms, which run at 102.4GB/s  Plus the CPUs that have intels new B390 iGPU are 4P/8E CPUs, so I doubt there will be much issues from low ram speeds. Something like the Radeon 890M have done fine with such speeds",Neutral
AMD,"> I've been eyeing Dells and Lenovos, and basically all SKUs that previously had 6000 are getting substituted with 4800   You're looking at normal DDR, not LPDDR. LPDDR5-9600 *is* a JEDEC spec, and already available in mobile.",Neutral
AMD,"The majority of the lineup still only has 4. Will be interesting to see what the pricing and performance is on those since these will likely be quite limited. What's also a bit crazy is there's three different nodes being used for the various GPUs, and the full 12 unit one is probably on N3.",Neutral

AMD,"Ice lake, Alder lake, Metor Lake",Neutral
AMD,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
AMD,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
AMD,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
AMD,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
AMD,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

AMD,"I mean yeah it's not ideal, but you could argue it's the same with XeSS or FSR 4 on RDNA 3. Since the OP said ""there's no decent upscaling on AMD handheld"", therefore I assume Opsticaler is out of the question too.",Negative
AMD,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral
AMD,"> Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core   There are SoC and platform level targets that depend on a lot more than just clock speed for the same cores. Consider how LNL's PMICs scale vs FIVR/DLVR. Or what operating point benefits the most from the on package memory.   Especially at really low power, the cores are not your big concern.

Intel's decision to label the new Xe3 iGPUs as ""Battlemage"" is certainly an interesting (odd) choice - my best guess for this decision is that next year, Xe3P discrete will launch alongside Xe3P iGPU in NVL, and they're saving the new Celestial naming for that launch event.

A couple titles amd does well in were thrown in there too though like God of war and Cod but im guessing the real performance difference is more like 40-60 rather than the claimed 70-80.

But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

The 5090 scaling issue is that we stopped resolution scaling. If you go beyond 4k the 5090 scales a lot. VR resolutions report the 5090 being as much as twice the framerates of 4090.",Positive
AMD,I've rewritten prev reply to provide more info.  I'll also link the scheduling patent here in case anyone reading this thread is interested: [https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2)   It sounds like gains in workgraphs scenarios will be be even greater.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
AMD,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative

AMD,"It's a huge amount of people.  At work, we have so many of these little databoxes that we plug into a monitor and keyboard. Small, portable, gets the job done, easy to replace and fit in all situations.  These would be a very nice drop-in replacement for those. These aren't designed for individual buyers, though they certainly won't mind the sales. It's more targeting corporate deployments where a company will want to buy hundreds to thousands or more, have them easily stored in a warehouse that can quickly be deployed when needed. When a computer for work breaks, I let my project manager know and they'll contact logistics to organize a swap, happened a few times last year and recently just had to swap a computer out due to a broken power button. These are super convenient for such cases, especially with office work where they take way more abuse as they remove the fragile screen + hinge on laptops if they're gonna be used in a situation where nobody cares about them.  My main concern is the keyboard. In office, keyboard and mouse are replaced all the time, so having one tied to the rest of the hardware is problematic. Companies often favour buying the cheapest en-masse and replace when broken, as hiring someone to fix expensive stuff that nobody cares about is not cost efficient. Yes you can just plug a new keyboard in, but I do have a bit of e-waste concern if some companies simply decide to throw them out due to speed/efficiency, kinda like how mostly fine laptops that have some broken bits are sadly discarded all the time by companies.  Then again, throwing away this is less wasteful and cost efficient than throwing away a laptop, so maybe it's still net better.",Positive
AMD,The laptop screen is definitely useful once you have to go into a conference room. The cost savings might be pretty marginal given the economies of scale for laptops,Positive

You were just better off buying a 1700X and OC'ing it to 1800X clock speed and pocketing the difference or spending it on more RAM or something else.  Notice how AMD basically doesn't allow for a slower speed variant with the same cores anymore on the high end like they used to? If you want a 9950X or 9950X3D you have to buy it. Only lower end SKUs like the 9600X will ever see a 9600 or 9500X with similar specs other than clock speeds. AMD might do a refresh of say the 5950X and make a '5950XT' but that's basically just a new stepping and it releases pretty much late into the lifecycle where it makes no sense to wait for it.

AMD,Duh. Tick tock was all about either getting your performance gains from using the same design at a new node or gains from a new architecture.,Neutral
AMD,Well compatibility layers exist and Microsoft is working hard on making WoA a first class solution. This X86 nonsense has to stop then only we will get progress in other architectures which would benefit consumers greatly of more companies can contribute.,Positive

AMD,Not when there's no easy way to install an alternate os on an ARM device like with x86.,Neutral

Unless there's more $, higher clocks or frankensteined like the the PS5 Pro (IIRC RDNA2+RDNA4 ML/RT), I don't think there'd be any marketing material for gaming performance, ALSO when Nova Lake-H is expected to bump performance with Xe3P.  I also get that they have this new strategy with the IOD being it's own thing and adding a Zen6 CCD (that can be borrowed from DC/desktop) for max nT, but CPU competition is already rough with Snapdragon and Apple much less Intel.  The only thing I can think of they'd be proud of is a new NPU and well we all know how the market responds to that lol",Neutral

Samsung even has put RDNA4 in the newest exynos 2600 if I'm not wrong. And still AMD doesn't give it all to the iGPUs, even if they have all the IP and those chips are new tapeouts anyways. If they did arch changes for rdna3.5+ they also need to revalidate the entire thing.   I don't see that there could be auch a big benefit selling basically 5 year old GPU arches...

AMD,Steam deck 2 delayed til 2029,Neutral
AMD,"My guess, based on what AMD has said about RDNA4 and UDNA, is that they didn't put the R&D into cutting RDNA4 down any smaller for iGPU usage. So far RDNA4 only has 2 die configs, 64 and 32cu. The 32cu config is exactly just 1/2 of the symmetrical 64cu config. And if you look at the die diagrams, it would take significant redesign to cut the size down further, far enough to fit into the space of 8-12cu RDNA3.5 spaces.  My guess is that UDNA is being designed for all sorts of configs, but has caused problem after problem for them... Just like every new GPU uArch family does for them. TeraScale, GCN, RDNA1. Each first iteration was a mess. I'm betting they wanted to get UDNA into iGPUs a lot sooner, and launch dGPU UDNA afterward. A guess.  NV hasn't been immune to this in the past. The FX Series, Tesla, and Fermi were all either under-performers, or problematic in their first iteration.   And weirdly Blackwell had a lot of initial driver issues. Way more than most people experienced with most generations of GeForce. I've used a variety of NV GPUs all the way back to 1999, and Blackwell was by far the messiest driver launch I can remember.

Since almost all of you misunderstood the situation - AGAIN - the only thing AMD was dropping was specific DAY 1 optimizations for specific games on architectures more than two generations old(which does not include RDNA3 by the way).  Things that usually only amount to a small boost and often only in some situations/setups.  General driver support, optimizations, bug fixes and feature support has not been dropped.  Very little is actually going to change, and it's basically exactly matching what Nvidia has done for a very long time.  If any of y'all actually think Nvidia is optimizing new drivers to boost performance for Pascal, Turing or Ampere GPU's specifically for the latest game releases - they are not. lol   Plus, drivers for older architectures are generally pretty darn mature already.  There's simply going to be much less to squeeze from them, which is why it makes way more sense to focus on getting more out of newer architectures that still have more room for improvement.",Neutral

Price to performance is almost incomparable, here. You are paying just as much for almost half the performance. Again, Qualcomm set the cost of the SoC's too high. There's no reason to buy them when an M4 is entry level. $1000 should have bought you the -84 SoC (which is some 20% faster on the GPU than the -78 or -80!) and a premium chassis, not the cheapest parts the OEM can spec out.",Neutral

AMD,"a year would actually be quite long, Zen 5 launched July 2024. A successor two years later at least for the H2 mobiles would be nice. October/November 2026 desktop release would be reasonable and fit previous cadence, tho there are rumours about a N2X delay.  I think the biggest issue is the lack of a dGPU refresh and the non-existend RDNA4 iGPUs. RDNA5 is likely H2 2027, so sticking with RDNA 3.5 hurts. Most APUs/mobiles will only run a more modern gen starting in mid 2028, if they can even ramp enough beside some Halo SKUs, dGPU and consoles (not even counting AI-GPUs). with the current lack of FSR4 for RDNA 3.5, that's dissappointing, tho they think about backporting.  dual stacked V-cache (each CCD with 2 V-cache layers) and better memory controller/IOD would've been awesome as well.   rumours and leaks obviously had nothing on the radar, so it's not suprising nothing came from CES, but still, Lisa booked a keynote - and brought basically nothing. at last years CES they delayed RDNA4 - so it's the second disappointing keynote in a row.",Neutral

They also showed off a bunch of cool concepts like the computer-in-a-keyboard from HP, the rollable laptop from Lenovo, the dual-screen laptop from Asus. * A lot of monitor news. * A lot of PC case related stuff were shown. * IKEA has launched a bunch of matter devices for home automation as well as a 10 dollar speakers that can pair with up to 100 units. * Motorola showed off their Razr Fold phone. * Nvidia's DLSS 4.5 update seems pretty big and will work on older generations as well. * LG and Samsung both showed off new TVs. The latter showed off micro RGB. * A lot of audio-related stuff like new soundbars, wireless speakers from Samsung, Onkyo and so on. * Razer announced some gaming related stuff if that's what you care about. A new stream deck keyboard, a new controller and so on. Hyperkin also announced a modular clamp-on controller. * A robot vacuum that can climb stairs. * A bunch of car related things were announced as well, such as Ford saying L3 driving will come in 2028. * L'Oreal showed off a flat iron that uses IR light. * Asus showed off a Wi-Fi 8 router. * Lego showed off ""smart bricks"" which seems neat.  I could keep going but I think you get the point. There is a ton of stuff from CES that are consumer related.

The software support isn't their and AMD is trying to force people into their overpriced enterprise gear instead of supporting their GPUs.  Unless you've dealt with trying to implement your own local LLM stuff, none of this matters. Microsoft is just paying OEMs to brand shit as Ai, as if people need, or want it. Let alone have any idea what they'd use an NPU for.   I do think NPUs are great if you want to keep your data local. But the amount of work and effort is high, furthermore these NPUs are weak.

(3 GB on both sides)  and again to be clear to not have the 8 GB vram issue all over again you need 24 GB if the ps6 comes with 30 GB or 32 GB if it comes with 40 GB.  nvidia and amd know this.  they just hate you and want to sell you hardware, that will become broken in 2-3 years already.  the fact, that you call this ""quite good"" is just ignoring reality and terrible.  can  you please start calling out scum companies shitting on us?",Neutral
AMD,"The unfortunate part for consumer GPU customers is... that's probably what Nvidia wants during a supply shortage.

AMD,Maybe in a year or two when RAM prices have hopefully become more reasonable  It would have to be good enough to pay for the more expensive VRAM  But I think they will just wait till the 10000 series. 90 series just released within the past year. Even the 50 series itself is essentially like a Super series refresh to the 40-super series. Not huge performance uplift. Not worth releasing something until they show substantial improvements.,Neutral

But there are plenty of people who don't give a shit about that sort of thing, and just want a raw power house to pump out frames.

Even if they're not nearly as competitive as I wish they were, AMD does keep Nvidia in check at least somewhat lol.  Of course, with the DRAM shortage I doubt anyone will make a refresh this year, but if one does the other probably will too.",Neutral

AMD,20 and 40 series were the only series in entire Nvidia history that had Supers.,Neutral
AMD,"It's weird that there was no Super series for the 30 series. They released the 3080 12gb and 10gb, so the 12gb could have been called the 3080 SUPER. Laptops got a 320 bit GA103 die that never made it into any product in the full configuration and was always cut down in really weird ways. Always 256 bit.  Even cut down as far as to put into some rare 3060ti cards. They could have easily been the 10GB RTX 3070ti SUPER. It's like it's a die they made, and then regretted it, and tried to make it disappear. Even the 3060 had room for more enabled SMs. It really feels like they just cancelled that while series as well because the crypto and COVID boom was already enough, so no need to put in more effort.",Negative
AMD,"nvidias super series is just a refresh. There are a couple reasons to do refreshes for a manufacturer:   1. You typically get better chips over time. At the beginning you typically don't exactly how yields and binning will be, after some time you can typically sell higher binned products because you know how it'll work out. Even if it's a few percent, it's a small improvement for hardly any cost. Especially when the next generation is far in the future.  2. Price drops. The vast majority of cost appears in development, not per unit cost. After selling enough units and your rnd is paid for you're pretty much only making profits and can easily drop prices. It's typically better to introduce a new, cheaper product than just lowering prices in the market.      The RTX 5090 likely wouldn't get a refresh, why? It would only threaten their compute cards.    The RTX 5080 is already using the full GB203 die.    The 5070ti is already super close to the 5080.    The 5060ti is already using the full die.   A refresh would only make sense for the 5070ti (essentially sell the current 5080 as a 5070ti super), 5070 and 5060 unless they want the same performance with more vram.    We don't know how far away the next generation is.    Blackwell was never a good candidate for a refresh, never really made much sense.",Neutral

AMD,"I'm using a GTX1070 right now.  It's.....not great. lol  I think it'll get a bit easier going forward, cuz the next consoles are inevitably going to be very disappointing, at least if they release within the next couple years and dont cost $1000.  There wont be any huge uplift in performance this time around because of the need to hit a price point that wont make people scream.  PS5 Pro already shows how little they're able to improve over time compared to what the PS4 Pro offered in a similar time frame(and without a huge increase in price...).  And not only will the PS6 specs not be that amazing, but we're bound to have another like three years of cross-gen titles as well.  So even people with something well less than a 5080 will likely still be capable of playing the latest games decently enough for a good while.  I think a 5080 will probably be very in line with what PS6 offers in general, really.  Bit sad, honestly.  Sure, it's fine for getting more longevity out of your existing PC, but this is all because prices and especially performance per dollar improvements are becoming so bad.

Yes NVIDIA skimps on VRAM. Id say its cards handle the VRAM it does have very effectively though and by the time you need more VRAM, it is time to consider a new GPU.

AMD,Props to Adam for asking about FSR4 on RDNA3 and if they will continue to lock new features away from older GPU's.

AMD,What happens if RDNA5 or whatever UDNA launches will AMD continue to abandon the previous gen? I think this is unacceptable int today's time period where people spent their hard earned cash on these products and they expect support for at least some time.

AMD,Well Adam is too scared to say exactly what was needed to be said.

AMD,"If you think RDNA3 is incapable of running FSR4 then by the same token DLSS 4.5 should have never been made available to RTX20 and 30, because those GPUs are also incapable then. Preset M's frametime cost is a huge hit on those GPUs - much worse than even the full sized FP8 model FSR 4.0.0 running on RDNA3.   Using the values from the HUB video today, I can see that the difference in frametime cost between Preset K and M on a 3090 at 1440p totals around 2.2ms - depending on the title but in that region. That's literally the cost of running the _entire_ FP8 model of FSR4 on my 7800XT at 1440p.   And I'm just comparing the _difference_ between Preset K and M. The cost of preset M itself is probably close to double the frametime cost _of the entire FP8 FSR4 model_ running on my 7800XT.  For reference, the INT8 model of FSR4 sits around 1.7ms.",Negative
AMD,Exactly we have some tone deaf people in the comments claiming that it isnt enough. I mean come on let us have a try and its on AMD to optimise the model for a better experience. We shouldn't begging AMD to release this to us when Nvidia just dropped DLSS4.5. This has become ridiculous...,Negative
AMD,"The question isn't if it's better looking than a FSR3, but if it's better than native resolution in terms of FPS,  and image quality. If it's only 10% faster native, but looks 10% worse, was it really worth it? At the end of the day is always ""How many more FPS does this upscaling et me?"" I feel everyone has forgotten what the point of upscaling actually was. It's not to look better than older tech. It's to get you more FPS.  The amount of people with an RX 7600 to 7800xt, far outnumber the people with an RX 7900xtx multiple times. They'll be launching software that worse, or has no benefit for like 70% of the user base trying it. Similar boat Nvidia is in with the RTX 2000 series being able to run DLSS4.5. It runs like crap. It only exists to upsell users to newer GPUs, and try out the tech. I believe at one point Nvidia made ray tracing possible to enable on the GTX 1660 cards. Maybe it still is. Even though it runs at like 10 FPS. They software updated DXR support. Just for the users to feel like they are missing out, and get them to run to the store.  On top of that, the INT8 version apparently looks worse. Intel regrets launching a better and worse version of XeSS. The open DP4a version ruined the reputation of XeSS for Intel. AMD would be doing a similar thing, maybe.",Negative

AMD,4.5 has a FP16 version that is what is running on 20/30 series. This is why its using 2x memory on 20/30 series and why its significnatly slower there.,Neutral
AMD,"People here are not framing it as ""we understand it doesn't work well, but we would like the option.""

That's just lunacy.",Negative
AMD,"Yes, it doesn't. WMMA are just instructions. It's not dedicated hardware like Nvidia's tensor cores, it just runs on CUs and competes against graphics rendering for resources.  Also notice the page you liked for WMMA on RDNA 3 specifically shows it lacks support for FP8, which is what FSR 4 relies on.  If you want to get pedantic RDNA 4 is technically not full dedicated hardware like tensor cores either, but unlike WMMA in RDNA 3, in RDNA 4 matrix multiplication acceleration does have dedicated pipelines inside the CUs, so it doesn't compete with graphics for resources (as much), and supports FP8 that FSR 4 uses.  As for the second link, yes, you can force FRS 4 on RDNA 3 and older (using either the leaked INT8 version, of the WMMA fallback which is also INT8), but the performance cost is so high it's barely worth using over native. You could argue it would be good to have the option still, and AMD is working on it, but obviously they are not happy with the state INT8 FSR 4 is in yet, and I can see why.",Neutral

AMD,"I think there are two reasons for it:  1. Frame Gen is not as widely used or desirable as upscaling. So people don't actually care too much that Nvidia locks it to 40+ series.  2. RTX 2000 is 3 generations ago. It's fine if it isn't running DLSS 4.5 well - you can still use the pretty good DLSS CNN model with decent performance. In contrast AMD is not support the immediately preceding generation when even something like the [7800XT will fly with the Int8 version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPMOjdvmHMk). Not even immediately preceding, they are still launching new products with RDNA 3.5 just now! It doesn't help that FSR3.x is just really bad compared to any ML-based upscaler.",Negative
AMD,"So AI accelerators AREN'T required for it, it would just mean less of a performance hit.",Negative
AMD,">RDNA 4 matrix multiplication acceleration does have dedicated pipelines inside the CUs  Do you have a concrete source that proves that? I tried looking into this a couple days ago, and as far as I could tell, RDNA 4 is still using its CU's regular SIMD units to do matrix multiplication. Doesn't seem like it has dedicated blocks for it like Intel (XMX) or Nvidia (tensor cores) do.",Neutral
AMD,"No offense, but that's complete nonsense. It's the same model powering both versions, just being run utilizing a different data format, likely there's just a type conversion taking place similar to how the FP8 version of FSR4 runs on RDNA3 on Linux. Upcasting to a higher precision data format does not take a significant amount of compute to do, it's extremely simple to do at runtime (which is very evident by the fact that the simple FSR4 INT8 model only sits about 25% faster than the more computationally expensive FSR4 model on RDNA3).",Neutral
AMD,Forgot about ARM. Yeah AMD and Intel should be worried.,Negative
AMD,no. FSR4 on linux is INT8.,Neutral
AMD,"You either didn't read my comments, you didn't comprehend what is written in them.  How is it anti-consumer when new GPUs have hardware accelerators that old GPUs don't have?  Was Nvidia ""anti-consumer"" when GTX cards didn't support DLSS because they didn't have tensor cores? No? So why is AMD anti-consumer then?  Was in anti-consumer when DX10 cards didn't support tesselation?",Negative
AMD,"> RTX 2000 is 3 generations ago. It's fine if it isn't running DLSS 4.5 well - you can still use the pretty good DLSS CNN model with decent performance. In contrast AMD is not support the immediately preceding generation  Just like Nvidia didn't support the immediately preceding generation (GTX 1000) and even the **current** generation (GTX 1600) cards when it launched DLSS. That will always happen when you go from no hardware acceleration in one gen to having hardware acceleration in the next. There will always be that point where someone is getting ""screwed"", for Nvidia it was Pascal/Turing, for AMD it's RDNA 3/RDNA 4.  AMD is at least attempting to make an INT8 fallback. Nvidia didn't even do that, just said ""sucks to be you"" to Pascal and low-end Turing owners.  >the 7800XT will fly with the Int8 version  lol  Being extremely generous by describing this as ""fly"". The video shows FSR 4 quality on the 7800 XT is a whopping 6% faster than native. Plenty of testing done by Digital Foundry, Hardware Unboxed, Gamer Nexus as well shows it's often in the ~10% faster than native ballpark in higher-end cards (7800, 7900 models). At that point it's hardly worth using over native, and that's on high-end models. On mainstream cards like the 6600, 6700 and 7600 models, which is the majority of RDNA 2/3 cards sold, the overhead would be even larger.  So yeah, I understand people would like the option, but I can totally see why AMD doesn't want to release it in this state.  >Not even immediately preceding, they are still launching new products with RDNA 3.5 just now!  I agree that the way AMD refuses to update their IGPs to their current GPU arch is incredibly stupid, but those are mobile chips that have nothing whatsoever to do with the people here asking for the INT8 version for desktop cards.",Neutral
AMD,">it would just mean less of a performance hit  No. Accelerators means lower performance cost **and** higher visual quality. Both of those together is what makes the upscaling worth using.  Without accelerators, you get a hit to visual quality while only getting a tiny performance improvement over native, which is hardly worth using. That's exactly what INT8 FSR 4 is. No point in reducing quality to gain +10% FPS, better to just use native.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm recalling from memory an anandtech-style deep dive I watched on youtube around the time the 9070 launched. I'll look for it again, I'll update this comment with the link once I find it.  To be clear, RDNA 4 still does matrix multiplication in the CUs, but the structures/ALUs inside each CU that do that math are physically larger, with more transistors, more registers, better schedulers, more pipelines (as in more literal silicon paths between CU units), etc. Basically, a larger portion of the transistor budget per CU dedicated to them. In addition, of course, to the new instructions, like FP8.",Neutral
AMD,"No, its not the same model. They remade the same model to run int FP16. Same model could not run, as 20/30 series cannot do it hardware wise. You cannot just use a same model and use different weight types. it does not work like that.  It isnt just a type coversion. We know what a type conversion looks like, and it looks like horrible performance. The first try of this was when they tried to make DLSS2 work on 1080. Typer conversion clearly isnt a solution.  >Upcasting to a higher precision data format does not take a significant amount of compute to do  You are using the same compute you would use for lower precision data, but with higher precision. And that means you can do a lot less of it. But with upscalers you cannot do less of it, you still got to do the entire thing. This means it gets slow. Its really no different than trying to run a game in FP64 mode, the GPUs just cant do it efficienty because they were never designed to handle a lot of FP64 compute (except some old AMD models).",Negative
AMD,"no, it's not",Neutral

AMD,"Yes, it is. The FP8 version technically runs, but performance is unusable.",Negative
AMD,"Oh, am I? How about, instead of this kindergarten insult, you attempt to explain how am I wrong? Everyone so far has failed to do so, give it a shot then.",Negative
AMD,"Anything looks better than FSR 3, that's not the point.  The point is that INT8 FSR 4 is not worth using **compared to native.** The problem isn't how it compares to FSR 3, it's how it compares to not using FSR at all. You're degrading image quality to gain 10% more performance. There's no point in using it, just run native.  >7800XT using ""FSR 4 Light"" gains 26% FPS @ Quality and 45% @ Performance.  This is just complete nonsense. Lots of tech outlets (Digital Foundry, Hardware Unboxed, Gamer Nexus, etc) reviewed the leaked INT8 version, and the gains on their tests are nowhere near this. [For example, Hardware Unboxed tested multiple scenarios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB0qmTCzrmI), and in many of them the 7900 XTX at 4K only gets a 10% to 15% improvement from FSR 4 quality compared to native. It's even worse for the 6750 XT at 1440p, which get 5% to 10% improvements in those scenarios. For mid-range GPUs it's absolutely not worth using, it's a worse experience than native.",Negative

AMD,We're definitely not using the same FSR4 bro...,Neutral
AMD,"Hardware enthusiasts just simply need sit this year out. Only mediocrity lies ahead for the next 18 months or so.  I mean maybe Intel will do something interesting, but it looks like they're hopping on the wagon, too.",Negative

A weak response from AMD though it wasn't like they could say, 'yeah we got nothing to combat PTL this year'  But if you ask me, I was already 'disappointed' a year ago. None of what AMD CES showed should really come as a surprise considering their 2 yr product cadence, there really was nothing to look forward to unless you're excited about their DC HW (which frankly I was, of course isn't consumer related at all^(unless you count 'accessing it' through the cloud lmao))",Negative

AMD,"Intel gonna up there game, 100%.  They blew amd out the water, with the modular tiled based panther lake CPUs. Which have endless possibilities.",Positive
AMD,"The fact that he claimed AI did any research whatsoever is really the cherry on the top.    This crap is exposing a mile wide separation between engineers and top level execs. Its easy to think they know what they're talking about because they get on stage and read a script, but it really seems like a lot of these people have NO IDEA how LLMs work, and people making these models just... arent correcting them? I guess they like the $500k salary.    We really need to stop platforming charismatic mouthpieces. AI would be excellent at replacing CEOs and keynote speakers.",Negative

AMD,"AMD presentations were just an investor round up. Literally, this is a service from people we know, look at how cool it is, we are hyping it up, now give them money, that they will then use to buy our hardware. Shoulder pats all around.",Positive
AMD,"to the guy saying gamers nexus was only covering intel and not the others:  1., that video came out like a day after the first day of CES, and 2., clearly not lol",Negative

AMD,We don’t have to sit out entirely! The monitor space has become extremely exciting. And I’m also excited for the Steam Frame.,Positive
AMD,"Panther looks great. If RAM situation doesn't mess it up, then there's a possibility for great new handhelds. It performs better than Lunar, which already pushed it up against Z2 and has XeSS with XMX support while AMD chips with RDNA3.5 miss out on FSR4.",Positive
AMD,"9950x3D is not even a year old, what do people expect? I feel like the new 50 chips got released because people expect SOMETHING, so here comes the binned chips. At least they are not marketed as 10,000 series chips.  At the end of the day AI is where all the money is, and those who cannot buy/afford an nvidia stack would naturally fall back to AMD, which is where their attention should be if they want to have the money to keep funding R&D...",Negative
AMD,"At least this is happening towards the tail end of a console generation. When COVID and crypto was huge in 2020, you needed a $500 GPU to match console level performance, and that was retailing for more like $800-900, when now a $200-250 GPU and $70 CPU can make things very playable. Most people won't actually be struggling until the PS6 comes around, and we'll still get PS5 ports for 4 years after that.",Neutral
AMD,"it's a year to upgrade monitor instead, lot of choices: Gsync pulsar, rgb 1440pUW qd-oled and 4k woled, both techs will probably come to normal 16:9 1440p as well at some point where the normal rgb layout would really help, 600/1040hz dual mode 1440p(no idea if the pixels actually switch fast enough, yet), 5k 165/330hz dual mode 2304 zone mini-led and probably some others, but those are the main attractions.",Neutral
AMD,It might be two or three.  We gotta see how long that bubble… bubbles?,Neutral
AMD,I mean it will be interesting if they get Celestial DGPUs by end of 2026 / early 2027 with that 24 month cadence from Dedicated BM. Hopefully Intel goes all out with Nova Lake as well. Also end of year at best.  The Igpu/Xe3 stuff from Intel is probably the most interesting hardware stuff short term for consumers. Very much competitive with amd at worst in a field amd used to dominate.  Would not be shocked to see more Intel Igpus in handhelds for the coming years.,Positive
AMD,Or get in to monitors instead of CPU & GPU.  Cool shit is going on with monitors.,Positive
AMD,"Eh ""Hardware enthusiasts"" I disagree. Venice and MI400 is definitely exciting bleeding edge HW. Of course with the discourse around AI in this community it's understandable, and obviously this IS CES and AMD only regurgitated the 9800X3D, Strix Point/Halo.",Neutral
AMD,More likely at least 2-3 years if not longer. Everything will be stunted and suppressed for years to come.   The only hope is the AI bubble pops tommorow,Negative
AMD,Agreed. There is a massive bubble that is going to burst. These deals being cut right now aren't being done with liquid cash. Sam Altman can't deliver on all of the insane promises he's making for Open Ai.   It's like we're trying to one up the crash from 100 years ago.,Negative
AMD,Watch the consumer hardware industry make a shocked pikachu face when in a few years a significant percentage of their former consumer base has tuned out never to return.  They spent decades and billions trying to get people hooked into excitement for an upgrade cycle and now they think they can switch to the fridge model and keep those same users attached.   The general public will be quick to learn that new products just means more of the same and that they arent worth buying or paying attention to,Negative

AMD,"panther lake is great, but you still need ram and storage for a pc",Positive
AMD,"If you are AMD, Intel or Nvidia your plans will have changed in the last month or so with the memory price issue now dominating hardware purchases   Why launch something big if no one can afford to buy it due to the memory cost?  So you slow things down, maybe temporarily focus on older cheaper product lines where the memory cost is more absorbable   Really the only one this really sucks for are YouTubers who are faced with little to review  For the rest of us we just wait for the memory cost issue to play out and focus on other improvements like monitors, desk, chairs, etc",Negative
AMD,"the PC hardware stagnation couldn't come at more opportune time for Intel. They have their 18A which they can beta test for 18 months with no pressure at all thanks to DRAM supply constraints products, pushing products prices up.",Neutral
AMD,"This shit is not just about AMD. If you noticed, pretty much all these tech companies and their CEOs are this far heads up in their asses. They literally think that the sun shines from their arseholes and we all should feel blessed because we have them and rejoice what they have to offer.  This keynote was hilariously tone deaf performance from AMD, but in the end not any differenet from the rest of this industry. It is not just about the consumers either, all these big tech companies are full of shit in business world too. I sincerely despise everything about tech nowadays. It is not only uninteresting, unimaginative and greedy, but the enshittification is real and it just gets worse.",Negative
AMD,"Hey, at least there are other companies we can turn to, right?",Neutral
AMD,AMD aint missing shit btw. Only thing they might miss right now are More AI margins by letting consumer busniess go hiatus.,Negative
AMD,And AFAIR their marketing team is leading in that field of SNAFU science.,Neutral
AMD,Been really picky watching them and this year alone i watched 0. Editorials summaries did much better job.,Negative
AMD,for people viewing CES online (rather than actually attending) its all just marketing.,Negative
AMD,Networking looks allright and 2.5Gbps is cheap with plethora of affordable switches and routers home/soho .  Personally I might go for SFP+/DAC 10Gbps connections just because it got very affordable. Zigbee protocol is working mighty fine too with lots of devices to have...,Positive

AMD,"And it wouldn't be the first time a company simply lies on the CES, so, there's a possibility 2026 has literally nothing but older hardware getting more and more expensive.",Negative
AMD,I mean strix Halo is in a completely different power envelope it requires a different level of cooling to even function decently,Neutral
AMD,That also hinges on panther lake actually being good and not more BS based on selective data.  I really don't think we should get our hopes up until anything launches yet as it might be too expensive and slower than advertised judging by the last couple years of hardware and pricing.,Negative
AMD,Except for the lovesense robot,Neutral
AMD,"Ehhh there were a few diamonds in the rough here and there, it wasn't as bad as ""corporate announcing government deals featuring ai deregulation"" before.",Neutral
AMD,Was thinking the same. But that was also the last year I attended so figured that was part of my perception.,Neutral
AMD,"Supply and demand baby! AMD were struggling to sell those chips, so they needed to put the price up. Their are only a certain amount of gullible people to sell to, so theh needed to maximise what they could recoup and minimize losses.",Negative

AMD,We understand but why this comment need to be here in literally every post of his?  Sure it's your freedom and right to comment anywhere you want but don't you guys get tired of having same argument over and over again,Negative
AMD,"""Capitalism"" is too broad and reductive of a villain. Is it a villain? Perhaps so. But we would all be happier with the products and relationships we had to the tech companies a decade ago than the relationship we are forced into now. Obviously, capitalism was still present then. Something separate, more specific, and smaller than the literal entire world order of capital is to blame for why things have gotten worse in tech.",Negative
AMD,"No Nvidia,amd,intel want to push us gamers into cloud gaming. You will own nothing & be happy",Negative
AMD,"Well the big difference between the Intel and AMD videos is that Intel genuinely launched very interesting product this CES. A whole new family of CPUs and a bunch of OEMs announced devices running those CPUs.      AMD though, launched nothing of note. Didn't even have to be here.",Positive
AMD,"AMD didn't have new products to launch so they could not show what you wanted to see, anyway - their new CPUs are 9-12 months out, GPUs will be 2027. If they talked the 400 series Ryzen AI and the 9850X3D, people would trash them about ""rebrandeon"".  Best they could do is some Zen 6 tease (beyond showing the server Zen 6 silicon), but it's probably too soon for that too. Maybe Computex.  Regardless of that, the AI hyping is probably due to them being a stock traded company and that's all the investors now care about.",Negative
AMD,"What do you mean ""nearly nothing to show""?  * Intel showed Panther Lake, which looks really nice. * Pretty much all the big laptop manufacturers showed off their next generation laptops, a lot of which seem pretty nice (a lot of focus on reparability this year). They also showed off a bunch of cool concepts like the computer-in-a-keyboard from HP, the rollable laptop from Lenovo, the dual-screen laptop from Asus. * A lot of monitor news as you mentioned.  * IKEA has launched a bunch of matter devices for home automation as well as a 10 dollar speakers that can pair with up to 100 units.  * Motorola showed off their Razr Fold phone. * Nvidia's DLSS 4.5 update seems pretty big and will work on older generations as well. * LG and Samsung both showed off new TVs. The latter showed off micro RGB. * A lot of audio-related stuff like new soundbars, wireless speakers from Samsung, Onkyo and so on. * Razer announced some gaming related stuff if that's what you care about. A new stream deck keyboard, a new controller and so on. Hyperkin also announced a modular clamp-on controller. * A robot vacuum that can climb stairs.  * A bunch of car related things were announced as well, such as Ford saying L3 driving will come in 2028. * L'Oreal showed off a flat iron that uses IR light. * Asus showed off a Wi-Fi 8 router. * Lego showed off ""smart bricks"" which seems neat.  I could keep going but I think you get the point. There is a ton of stuff from CES that are consumer related. Just because you were hoping for specific things from a handful of specific companies does not mean the entire show is bad.",Positive
AMD,"I know this is hard to believe, but there's more to consumer than just reddit gamers.",Neutral

AMD,Exactly. Thank you.,Positive
AMD,"I only watched a few of his videos such as the LTT drama and some of his other news updates, he seems like such a consumer pro person and actually giving good takes. Not sure why there is hate around him?",Positive
AMD,"Alternatively, maybe you don't know how things work.  An AI isn't just a LLM. It's an LLM + harness. The harness is the set of tools that the LLM can use including amongst other things a search tool. Also, LLMs aren't just trained to predict the next token. After pretraining comes a ton of reinforcement learning where it's taught to produce desirable outputs.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, same here. I built my 5950x, RTX 3090 PC in January of 2021.  It looks like it will continue to be my main PC for a while.",Positive
AMD,"I actually hoped to upgrade to a 9950x3d from my 5950x at the end of last year, but the price of ram put me. I already had 64gb of ddr4 and the price of that in ddr5 put me right off.",Negative

AMD,The anti-GN astroturfers and the Nvidia astroturfers will occasionally hold hands.,Neutral
AMD,"It isn't even about games anymore. We, the consumers were the ladder who helped them succeed. We bought their products for years and now that they're up top, they kicked us aside.  They're done with us.",Negative
AMD,Indeed. A few people in my friends group looked at the ram prices and decided to buy a new monitor instead of upgrading the setup.,Neutral
AMD,"OLED is better and more affordable than ever, true. At least *something* to be excited about.",Positive

AMD,"Yep. Looking to upgrade my 48"" c2 to something in the 30"" range.",Positive
AMD,VR is looking stacked this year: genuinely excited for the software and hardware opportunities within the next 12 months.,Positive
AMD,I mean it really seems like the hardware is kind of trash on the frame especially since they really want to push flat screen gaming but it has terrible AR support I don't know why they thought that would be a good combination and then they falsely marketed it with making it look like I could do color pass through when it's still black and white like the valve index was from 2019 it's horribly outdated for AR or mixed reality gaming.,Negative

AMD,exactly. XMX XeSS 2 vs FSR 3 is literally the hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby meme.,Neutral

AMD,"also not a bad time yet to buy storage, it’s gone up but not as crazy as DRAM yet.",Neutral
AMD,I thank myself everyday that I had choosen to upgrade everything but monitors by the end of 2025.   Seems like monitors are the only thinks not much affected by this shit show.  Will save slowly and hopefully can buy decent monitor by the end of 2026,Positive
AMD,"There's quite literally zero indication that Celestial dGPU even exists, let alone is coming out anytime soon. They're not even calling these new iGPUs Celestial.",Negative
AMD,If Xe3p Celestial dGPUs exist I don't expect them until late 2027 and at this point and considering RDNA 5 and RTX 60 have been pushed back that probably could benefit Intel because they can cook extra with a Xe3p dGPU and let GDDR7 prices go down especially if the AI bubble circle jerk implodes this year.,Neutral
AMD,nova lake and b770/celestial have had such high promises and leaks have looked really good. i hope they actually come out lmao,Positive

AMD,But they have to keep their fabs humming along no matter what or they lose billions.,Neutral
AMD,"They simply have nothing for consumers on the graphics and APU side this year. At least there is desktop zen 6, though they decided not to show anything about it.",Negative
AMD,That is how the market works. All of your consumer products are born from enterprise products. Most consumers over value their position and the power you think you have over these corporations. It will always be enterprise first when you are a pubicly traded company with share holders.  I think alot of consumers are the ones tone deaf as they dont really understand the business side of how this all works.,Neutral

AMD,"why do people need some company, any company to be their friend?",Negative
AMD,Too bad I'll need a new GPU to drive it if I finally make the jump to 4k,Negative
AMD,We should get good pricing for monitors. Data centers don't need them at a high ratio.,Negative
AMD,Have they figured out how to make OLEDs cheap yet?,Neutral
AMD,Did they reveal anything new? Their Apple M have always been good but Apple M5 was mostly a refreshed M4 and was already released months ago too.,Positive

AMD,"Because none of this is real, this is all astroturfing.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, their product cycle did not line up with this years CES. They should have just sat that out instead of making it a an AI corpo event.

AMD,That's videocardz's commentary. They also say this:  >Xe2 (Battlemage) – used in Arrow Lake...  Which is not only outright wrong but doesn't even match the slide. I posted the link purely because it was the easiest place to find a copy of the slide.,Negative

AMD,">up to 128GB LPDDR5X RAM   So, $2500 then?",Neutral
AMD,Come to papa. So basically we just need to add a mini-itx case and power supply.Let's hope they don't go too crazy with pricing.,Neutral
AMD,"Only seeing the 128GB option for this board, so probably going to cost 2k+ with today’s memory chip prices.    I already have the Strix Halo chip (Evo-X2) running a 5080 via OcuLink on the 2nd M.2 adapter.  This gaming setup is 4K Heaven, and chews through MOE LLMs on the side.    Honestly the onboard graphics 8060s is going to be more than fine for most people, I was playing 4K at 100+ fps (DLSS, FG, No RT) and it felt great.  Then I tried Path-Tracing in Cyberpunk with the 5080 and couldn’t go back.",Neutral

AMD,"This thing paired with either one of the Noctua passive coolers or better yet, one of the passive air cooled cases from either Streacom or HDPLEX along with a Fanless PSU (ATX, SFX or even one of those GaN ATX PSU from HDPLEX) could make for such a kick-ass, fanless PC while still getting the same performance as a PS5!",Positive
AMD,"This might look like a niche product, but I can see it being extremely good for gaming as a dual GPU lossless scaling system. Why? Let me explain:  1) It's an insanely strong iGPU (40CUs), which is not bottlenecked by PCI-E speed (like normal dual GPU systems).   2) You get full x16 bandwidth for the main GPU (which I dunno how they were able to do it).   3) Since it's a igpu, there's no fiddling with some games running on the iGPU and others running on the main card. It will work like a laptop, so the games, out of the box, always run on the main GPU and the iGPU handles the Lossless scaling frame generation.  4) With this, you can have the very solid lossless scaling frame generation on top of your main GPU without any performance hit. Latency will be severely reduced too.  5) Your main GPU will have more VRAM available than running a single GPU. At 4K you can save up to 3 / 4GB of VRAM, which is HUGE for 16GB cards, since 24GB or above are currently unobtanium.  The problem will be most definitely the price, since strix halo has been shown to be extremely expensive.  In any case, I'm very curious to see how it will work and what kind of IO it will have.",Positive

AMD,"not exactly, the frameworks pci-e slot is a pci-e 4.0 running at x4. the Minisforum motherboard uses a full pci-e 5.0 x16 slot. while you could use a gpu with other changes (you need to convert or saw off the end of the x4 slot, or convert any other port to x16), the performance of the two would not remotely be the same with a dgpu.",Neutral
AMD,In gaming there is a 0-10% drop in FPS (mostly 3%) difference according to a few YouTube videos posted on the topic by MatthewMoniz. I can’t personally tell a difference honestly.  It also helps the Strix Halo Memory is in the 8000+ MT/s range.,Neutral
AMD,"There's the `-ot/--override-tensor` option in llama.cpp to override expert tensors to iGPU or CPU. For example, when ROCm0 is dGPU and ROCm1 is iGPU, you can use `-dev ROCm0,ROCm1 -ts 1,0 -ot exps=ROCm1` to do that.  Using 7900 XTX and 395 to run gpt-oss 120b in this way, it achieves +60% token generation perf at 64K context size comparing to only using 395, and it only requires less than 16GB of additional dGPU VRAM when allocating 512k context for batches.  When running 8 concurrent batched requests at 32K context each, it can even double the token generation performance.  Note that Linux and amdgpu-dkms is required to achieve the best possible performance due to HIP P2P copy support only available in that config.",Neutral
AMD,> the Minisforum motherboard uses a full pci-e 5.0 x16 slot  Which is weird for an APU that only comes with 16x lanes at 4.0 which also need to feed the nvme slots...,Neutral
AMD,Or make a very spicy cluster 😈,Neutral
AMD,"> the performance of the two would not remotely be the same with a dgpu.  Depends on the GPU you stick in there. If it's a card with ample memory, then you are barely losing anything up until the 3080~ range of performance. Seeing as it lost only 4% when TPU tested it back in the day and stuck it in a 16X 2.0 slot (same bw). I bet a 3090 might even have lost slightly less despite being faster, since it has more VRAM.  Even 4090 only lost something like 8% at the worst affected resolution, but by then there started to be some real performance outliers. Where they lost a lot more with some resolutions/games.  Their 5090 testing actually showed less impact than the 4090 testing (6% at 4k average). But they had swapped out some of the most impacted games from their test suite by then. So it isn't really comparable to earlier results.",Neutral
AMD,Ive looked into this and it doesn't work.   The pcie slot only provides 25 watts snd no gpu anybody has tried will start with that.  You have to use a pcie riser that can inject power to make it work.,Negative

AMD,"it's the odd part of the spec I agree. i'm just saying what the reporter is claiming.  regardless, even if it was a 4.0 slot, a x16 slot is far different than a x4 slot still.  i personally think its a 4.0x16 slot and the ssds are handled by chipset pci-e",Neutral
AMD,"because high end cards don't lack the one weakness that affects it the most, that is performance when vram is getting close to/hit its limit, and the gpu gets sent onto asset swapping with memory. thats why for example, current generation gpus like the 5060 hit a major performance bottleneck when the 8gb vram is filled up, because it attempting to swap memory on the 8x slot performs significantly worse than the AMD counterpart which is wired for x16, despite both being pci-e 5.0 based gpus. This bandwidth bottleneck id imagine, would also affect gpus used in vram heavy compute",Negative
AMD,"These are based on my own testing. I've tried myself using an M.2 to oculink adapter to connect an eGPU to strix halo. It's not a long term setup due to the form factor limitations (I have to keep the cover open), so having an option like the Minisforum ITX board is interesting.",Neutral

Intel had a whole generation of chips designed for ultra low powered devices such as handhelds, *with on-die ram to reduce as much latency and energy draw as possible* meanwhile the only ""purpose"" built chip for handheld was the one for steam deck which is actually a cut down not initially meant for a handheld still with much die space just disabled and lying around.

Once ramp up and yields hit 90%, Intel will blow them away on margins on a chip for chip basis, while having almost no limits on how much silicon they can pump out.

AMD,The differences in gens are massively overstated.  AMDs 8060s iGpu from last January is still leagues more powerful than any xe3 chip will be based on Intels own charts.  Intel saying they’re using ancient silicon is rich when Intels simply has archaic performance.,Neutral

AMD,"> But AMD still miles ahead of Intel.  Intel's strategy with low power cores (borrowed from ARM) is a good idea though but PC schedulers (specifically windows, no surprise) weren't well suited to handling it. That's definitely something I'd like to see on an AMD chip. Intel also is way ahead on iGPU for non-gaming uses and closing the gap for gaming pretty rapidly.",Positive
AMD,"AMD is only ""miles ahead"" in gaming performance really.",Neutral
AMD,And what is the pricing on 8060S chips?   And no thank you to FSR3.1.,Negative
AMD,Something like 30% better at 15w. But strix point scales embarrassingly bad past 25w. Even on an ancient node they refuse to give it on die infinity cache.,Negative
AMD,What make steam deck good product all these years is price and performance at low power. Something like wildcat lake with 6 cores and 8 thread would make much sense in handheld then pair it with good igpu.,Positive
AMD,"Apparently they're even doing some kind of reference platform (what that entails I have no clue), so I think Intel is about to take the handheld market more seriously than AMD ever did.  If they come out with custom chips for it, I'd like to see an Ultra 5 CPU tile paired with the B390. The big CPU tile has little use on a handheld, but the big GPU is extremely useful. More cores on the CPU tile will also fightthe GPU for the limited power budget that handhelds need. If they can make it cheaper and more efficient by using a basic CPU and the best GPU, that will go a long way in allowing cheaper handhelds than what we have now with much higher performance than what we have now.",Positive

AMD,"The Pentium D and Core 2 Quad *were*, in fact, ""glued together"" chips.  The first was two single-core dies on a single package, which had no communication between them other than via the front-side bus.  The second was two dual-core dies on a single package, likewise with no communication other than via the FSB.  AMD's first dual-core was an actual dual-core.  Their first quad-core was an actual quad-core.  When Zen came around, and the server chips were MCM designs, it still wasn't appropriate to describe them as ""glued together"", because all the inter-die communication was on the package - it was not single-socket SMP, like the early Intel ""glued"" chips were.",Neutral
AMD,"I am not defending them at all, but they were not lying with Kentfield either. Then again, they did the exact same thing again with the chiplet Ryzen. 3950X and the 3900X are very interesting cases of weirdness. both consist of 2 dies, both of which consist of 2x4 cores with each their own L3 cache. So while on paper it is 64MB, in reality it is 2x16+2x16... At least the 3950X runs 4+4 + 4+4, while the 3900X could be 4+2 + 3+3. They very much called them 16 and 12 cure CPUs... Ah well.  They changed it for Zen 3 into 1x8 packages which are a lot better for performance, but still the 1x8 + 1x8 configuration used to this day is haunted by the problems they mocked Kentfield for. We are at the point where yields for monoliths are too expensive, so we kind of have to do with some infinity fabric drawbacks. Fun thing is that Intel is back there as well, so the tech itself kind of is the answer at the moment.  I am interested in the performance gains for Panther Lake, seeing what packages like this together will do. But, as I have seen with my Vega GPU; temperature differences have caused issues between the CPU and HBM memory and my card as well had the RAM torn off of the substrate thanks to temp fluctuations because of die height. So Intel now scales this into a modular system, but have they solved stuff like this?",Neutral
AMD,"Yep  I bought a rx 7900 GRE after years of being an Nvidia user, and i was (and still am) very happy with it because at that price point it made way more sense to buy it over a 4070  Now after whatever the fuck amd is doing with fsr4 and after seeing that dlss 4.5 will work with rtx 2000 and 3000 cards, i am certain i am not going to buy AMD again unless the other options are significantly worse, which is unlikely. If intel manages to launch a rtx --70 card equivalent when i need to upgrade, that's what i'm likely to buy, because NVIDIA will offer ridiculously low amounts of VRAM and AMD won't get a dime out of me after all this bullshit with them still not releasing the version of fsr4 compatible with rdna3 THAT WAS LEAKED AND MADE PUBLIC MONTHS AGO.",Positive

AMD,"You're completely right that handheld market from non-console players is quite small in the grand scheme of things, but I don't see why a release of portable PS6 or Xbox whatevername is going to hurt it.  PS6 Portable is highly likely to be locked down to Sony ecosystem and storefront, and we've seen how expensive ROG Ally Xbox was, and nobody trusts MS to deliver good mobile software at this point.  I don't think those mainstream consoles will steal that many users from the current handheld gaming market, it's small precisely because it's mostly aimed at enthusiasts and they'll value the ability to run emulators or having good price/performance from low margin chinese brand, even if ultimate performance lags behind.",Neutral
AMD,"There are 3 advantages to competing in the handheld market:  1) is mindshare. Financially, handhelds are a rounding error. But they have a disproportionate mindshare in the enthusiast community, and strong branding within that community is worth more than just the profit gained from that community, because that community brings externalities: They often act as advisors to non-techie friends and family, they drive online discourse, etc.  2) A ""dedicated"" handheld chip is just a low power, cost optimized APU with a good ~~APU~~ GPU. They don't have to be exclusively used in handhelds. They can (and will be) dual used in lower cost laptops. Many people find handhelds to have sufficient performance for their usecase - I think a lot of people would also find that same level of gaming performance in $500 laptops to also be sufficient too.  3) It's a market that's not really penetrated by Nvidia (sans Switch). Any PC gaming market that has a weak presence by Nvidia is worth fighting over between Intel and AMD because volume for driver and feature support is important for any future attempts to compete up market",Positive
AMD,"I think this is a fair take. Not to mention the market share difference between AMD and Intel in this segment. Intel has much more at stake, especially when Macbooks are gaining more popularity than ever. From their financial results you can see just how much CCG makes an impact for Intel, that includes their mobile segment ([CCG is double DCAI revenue](https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1753/intel-reports-third-quarter-2025-financial-results)). AMD has always been playing the long game, as long as their foot is in the segment, they'll attempt to grow even if their cadence isn't as fast as others. CPUs and GPUs are their main $ makers for client while DCAI is sailing. AMD has an economic decision to R&D new designs and spin new chips for a handheld specific SoC to outweigh what they already have with supplying mobile SoCs.  Handhelds gaining popularity just happened to be in AMD's favour since they always had GPU IP to implement in their APUs. You would think because AMD can conveniently use their mobile IP from laptops/SBCs (miniPCs)/embedded that the handheld market is a viable source for revenue but that has shown to be murky at best. The ROG Xbox Ally is proof of that, and the many other handhelds that go for $600 at min to >$1000 avg.  Here's what Dr. Ian Cutress had to say about [AMD's Q3 2025 Financials](https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/amd-2025-q3-financials):  >The most recent quarter also saw the launch of some new handhelds based on Ryzen Z-series chips, though it doesn’t sound like those are having nearly the same impact as traditional console SoC sales.  Less than consoles, so that answers 'where's a handheld ""purpose-built"" chip'  as you say, 'because none of them could afford it or justify the design costs based on the market size'.",Positive
AMD,"SteamDeck actually did incredibly well given its Valve's first handheld console entering a dominant market. It sold way above Valve's expectations and they were also quite surprised that the higher end models (i.e. OLED) proportionally sold a lot more (which meant that consumers were more willing to pay more for premium less value orientated models).  It takes time a new entrant into an established market to start taking a foothold, what were you expecting, that Steam Deck would suddenly take 40% of the market?

When it comes down to it, you always just should buy what is the best and reward the company doing good things with your money  Right now in the mobile space, I see no compelling reason to buy AMD at all.

Please learn a bit history about your favorite subject — Intel \*never\* could compete on price, not even once.  Even in the 1970s, they got kicked their arse by Japan during the memory-wars and **Robert Norton Noyce** (in his function as Intel-CEO back then) upon coming back from a business-trip in Japan, was talking in awe about the manufacturing-environment over there in Far&nbsp;East — He himself coined the term *»Yield-shock«*.  Look it up. Back in the U.S., they were basically shocked, how clean, efficient and high-yielding everything was over there in Japan — Intel never could compete on costs ever since, that's why they left the DRAM-business from one day to another (as the world's #1 memory-maker before), after they've been pushed out of the market in no time due to others' higher manufacturing-efficiency and yields (thus lower costs) Japanese and other DRAM-manufacturers achieved and consequently could sell way below the U.S.' market-price.  ---- Also, if there's any meaningless company to work for and toss your life away at the job in a cubicle, it's soulless Intel, which is infamous and notoriously known for decades for their utterly toxic work-climate — They treat their staff as worker-bees, even canceling dinner at their in-house cafeteria in need to save money, while their CEO got $219 million USD (the industry's highest salary) for a joke and dumpster-fire of a job at the top …  > And AMD’s “fab” is basically in the multiverse...They gave up on making their chips in US and screwed so many american jobs, just to be a reseller — it relies solely on Taiwan, which sits in one of the most geopolitically unstable situations in the world.  AMD \*was\* once manufacturing domestically in the U.S. for ages since the Seventies on home-soil, *until* it was illegally strangled financially for years on out by no less a figure than Intel itself (who cut them lose on revenue and profits at bribed OEMs), until AMD had to spin off their own in-house semiconductor-manufacturing division after billions in losses into *The Foundry Company* in March 2009 and what we today call *GlobalFoundries*, to even avoid bankruptcy and cease existing …  So if anyone is to blame for AMD no longer manufacturing in-house as a IDM on American home-soil, it's especially Intel! Intel screwed so many jobs in the U.S. for AMD, by *forcing* them to spin off GloFo.  Intel also largely relies on Taiwan, which former chaos-CEO Gelsinger described as ""not a stable place"" and that ""You don't want all of your eggs in the basket of a Taiwan fab"" — Intel still does though and uses TSMC.",Neutral

Just to add, I had a Phenom II X3 720BE. Which was in fact a quad-core with a disabled core. However they were so popular that AMD started selling perfectly working quads as X3, so a lot of users (including me) could unlock the 4th core just by enabling a BIOS setting called advanced clock calibration which let you individually alter clocks per core if I remember corretly. However you just enabled it and didn't alter anything, voila free extra core!    Stuff like that and unlocking pipelines on GPU's just doesn't exist today, I miss that a lot.

Issue is going to be memory bandwidth and physical size, if you want it in a normal socket you can't go too big, and if you use a 256 bus you're either doing a whole low volume custom thing like Strix Halo or you're using an overkill bus for the whole platform.",Positive
AMD,"The problem is that all three companies are unreliable as GPU makers for consumers at the moment.  I don't trust intel at the moment, specially with CPUs, they have promised ridiculous feats time and time again and underdelivered countless times, with some very recent gigantic fuck ups like the stability priblems in 13th and 14th gen CPUs. In terms of GPUs i still don't trust them with their ridiculous previous issues like needing reBAR on to have decent performance, we'll see how they evolve.  Nvidia constantly lowers the quality of their product tiers, and now 60 tier cards have the memory bandwith of old 50 tier cards, with not enough VRAM.  And AMD usually does nothing relevant in terms of GPUs. FSR4 is actually quite out of character for them, previously all of their FSR versions worked both with their previous gens and cards from other brands, and AMDs strategy, at least with with CPUs, is anything but shortsighted.

So as it doesn't directly affect me, I'm not really digging that deep into it. Truth be told, I have never been less informed when it comes to mobile/smaller SoC/CPU's/GPU's than I currently am.    Kinda struggling in general to keep interest up like when I was younger except during spurts leading up to upgrades. It's just not the same anymore. I mean with my current PC I just set turned on XMP to 6400MT/s CL32, set core voltage offset to -20 and put my 7900 XTX at 1.1V and -5% power limit and that's it. Did try 6000MT/s with CL30 and 1:1 but the performance difference was less than 1% in my benchmarks so I just set it back to XMP instead, also did try to run it at 6400M/s 1:1 CL32 but it wasn't 100% stable, it gave a more noticeable boost though. I did tinker a whole lot more with my old setup but it was quite a lot of work to get those extra 10% out of my B-die RAM and 5900X.     Also kinda don't want to push my 9800X3D my Asrock X870E Nova for obvious reasons. Not that I think my CPU will die, but why even risk it for 5%~ performance boost?

Sure it requires LPDDR but I think pretty much the only devices with DIMM’s on Strix Point are devices that don’t really care much for the GPU or are hardly portable.  Framework’s 16 inch for example loses like 40% of its performance on battery and still is average to poor on battery life because of it uses DIMM’s instead of LPDDR.

AMD,"> we dont have much info on raw cpu performance for you to make this claim  We can make educated assumptions based on prior product lines.   Lunar Lake, despite what people think, was far more competitive than it is given credit for.   Whilst Strix Point had a better better multicore performance, [Intel’s Xe2 out performed the iGPU when it came to gaming.](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Lunar-Lake-iGPU-analysis-Arc-Graphics-140V-is-faster-and-more-efficient-than-Radeon-890M.894167.0.html)  Lunar Lake was also around 5% faster in single core performance. This was despite Strix Point using Zen 5, and also despite Lunar Lake only being a modified Meteor Lake. The multicore performance was substantially better with Strix Point but for gaming, single core matters more.   The main thing to keep note of is the power consumption. Intel drew less power than Strix Point whilst remaining within reaching distance of its performance.  Recency bias has skewed discussions around AMD and Intel. People haven’t been paying attention to Intel’s mobile chips.   Lunar Lake was far more competitive than people think when it came to performance per watt and in gaming scenarios outperformed AMD whilst drawing less power.  So with Panther Lake, I see no reason why it won’t be even better. Throw in Intel’s XMX cores for XeSS and Panther Lake is looking like a much better option for portable gaming than AMD.  I can understand hating on Intel’s desktop offerings, they’ve been dogshit. However their mobile offerings have been as good, if not better, than what AMD has offered for the last 3 years.   AMD’s Zen 3 mobile processors back in 2022/23 were good, don’t get me wrong, but every single one of their mobile chips since then have been disappointing because they seem to put zero effort into them.

AMD,If it is compatible with Zen 3 Ryzen 5000 CPUs then it should atleast support a 6 core CPU! You can check by benchmarking your CPU and if it doesn't hit or stay at its rated clock frequencies without thermal throttling then you can blame the VRMs maybe. Check VRM temps in HWinfo,Neutral

A minimum, I think it's something that everyone who is budget restricted should give a shot; especially if you're more of a patient gamer. For me, a 5700XT to a 4070 Ti Super felt like a brand new computer that didn't really need anything else.   In my case, I never actually naturally encountered a title that my 3600 couldn't run that I really wanted to play. Sure I saw some in benchmarks showing that some titles experienced sub-70FPS, but seeing it is different than actually encountering it in my natural course of gaming. Plus.. it's pretty much the same as seeing a title on PS5 or Switch that interests me, but I'll probably never play because I don't have a PS5 or Switch.  Sure some titles would also perform better than my 3600 could when paired with a 4070 Ti Super, but for the most part 90FPS or higher feels fine to me and I only have a 144hz 1440p monitor that I can't really tell the difference at between 110FPS and 144FPS. DLSS feels perfect fine and really carries the 3600 pretty far.   In all honesty, Hell Let Loose was the only title that I ever really naturally encountered that made the 3600 feel a bit tired, but by all means it was playable.   I did eventually move on to first a 5600 and then a 7600x, but that was more of a no-brainer financial decision. I found super good prices on both when prices were good ($110 on the CPU/mobo/RAM side of things after selling my old mobo/RAM/CPU). In all honesty, I couldn't personally say I've naturally encountered any game-changing improvements with either the 5600 or 7600x. Again, there definitely are some out there. Especially BF6. But you can stretch a 3600 extremely far and get great results (until you run into something that you flat out can't that's under 60FPS).   I've since played a couple games that my 3600 probably would have struggled with, but in all honesty they were titles I thought were overrated and could have lived without and that was my experience playing them. Had I upgraded from a 3600 to 7600x with the current prices and knew better, I'd probably have pretty bad buyers remorse.",Neutral

I can finally run my expensive ram kit at its advertised speed.",Negative
AMD,"The 5700X3D would be an upgrade, but it's hard to find that chip at a decent price.  The 5600X is already pretty good, why are you considering an upgrade?",Neutral
AMD,"If you can find it or the 5800X3D for a good price, yeah good upgrade.",Positive
AMD,"Kinda depends on your GPU/resolution, otherwise for CPU based / extra multicore it's good.",Positive
AMD,"The Zen 3 3D CPUs like the 5700X3D are decent upgrades over regular Zen 3 but the pricing is completely prohibitive  Unless you get lucky and find a legit one for cheap somehow, I wouldn’t consider it",Negative

AMD,I play cyberpunk with many mods and over all the cpu dosnt keep up with my demands anymore i am almost always cpu bottlenecked  in r6 cod helldivers now i have a 3060 i can upscale if i rly need to but not if my cpu is the problem..,Negative
AMD,1080p  i have a 3060 but my cpu is almost alwys the bottleneck,Neutral
AMD,"Would make almost no difference in most games, more cores isn’t helpful",Negative
AMD,"Very interesting, I wouldn't normally suspect a 3060 to bottleneck a 5600X.  In some games it could be a factor of the number of cores. I don't play cyberpunk, but apparently it does utilize more cores. You may therefore find more performance even by going to a 5700X or 5800X. In most games, performance should be the close to the same across all of the 5000 series.  There is nothing wrong with the 5700X3D and its a great chip, its just hard to justify at the price its currently available at. You could probably upgrade your GPU with the leftover cash from choosing the 5700X over the 5700X3D.  I would always recommend considering your own use case though, and looking at benchmarks to see if any potential upgrade is worth it to you.",Positive
AMD,I don't get how a 5600 can choke a 3060 eh.   You use dual channel ram?,Negative
AMD,yeah gpu is low on priority bcs as i said my cpu is almost 90% the problem  unfortunately,Negative
AMD,"I see your list of games, only for R6 a better CPU would matter at boosting higher refresh rates.",Neutral
AMD,Yes xmp bla bla  cod is cpu heavy .  Cyberpunk is cpu heavy  even more with mods  so in cyberpunk my gpu is nor aly at 90 or so never max i still get 30 fps at this poibt with all the mods thats bcs my cpu is dying  if my cpu wasnt dying i could upscale the gane to get more gpu performance and id be at 60 probably fps but i cant upscale bcs my cpu is crying already,Negative
AMD,no bcs warzone cpu bottleneck my cpu is 80-100% usage that aside in cyberpunk i have 30 fps not bcs of grapgics bcs my cpu is not capable of handling the modded game yes my gpu is not great but i could use a upscaler for more fps if my cpu could handle it but bcs i have cpu bottleneck everywhere i cant as i stated above almost every game is cpu bottlenecked with my system,Negative

AMD,The 7500F combos well with everything that isn't a 4090/5090,Neutral
AMD,"Depending on what your use case is, you may be better off with a 16GB version card, especially if you're planning to be at 1440p/2160p for resolution. So, in this case it's still a good pairing but I would consider the AMD Radeon 9600 XT 16GB which can typlically be found around the same price as the 5060 Ti 8GB, or the 16GB version of the 5060 Ti or the RTX 5070 if you can swing it.",Positive
AMD,"Its a perfectly fine cpu and gpu.  I wouldn’t recommend it for 4k gaming, but a 7500f and 5060ti (preferably 16 gig of vram vs. 8) will do reasonably well at 1080p or 1440p.  The next question is price.",Positive
AMD,"is the Intel Corei5-12400 better? my budget is like 1500€, probably more because I want to upgrade it over time. CPU 's and GPU prices are rising so that is my main priority",Positive
AMD,>is the Intel Corei5-12400 better?   No and nope.  Think about a 9070 non-XT,Neutral
AMD,"The 12400 usually is a little better than a 5600x, worse than a 7600x.  A 14600k is usually as good, or a little better than a 7600x in gaming with the cost of efficiency.    The benefit of LG1700 with the 14600k, is you can find mobo’s that use DDR4.",Positive

AMD,Is a single 4tb nvme cheaper?    Phantom spirit cooler is a little better for the same price?    Maybe second hand 5800?    Where's the PSU score on the PSU tier list?,Neutral
AMD,"Thank you, I didn't even consider such factor. These two look excelent.",Positive
AMD,"Sadly, 4TB are 100$ more expensive than these 2 (roughly 240$ vs 340$)...   Phantom spirit - found only black here, not much difference in the price, but still prefer design (white)  5800 second hand option is something to consider, I haven't peaked into the second hand market as thought it would be a bit risky.

AMD,"4080 Super is slightly better than the 5070 Ti but it's used (presumably), which creates some risk. 9070 XT is almost but not quite as good as the 5070 Ti, and with that price difference I'd go with the 9070XT. The 5070 should really only be an option if you're planning on doing more video editing than gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"9070 XT is the value buy right now - very capable for gaming, a solid price, and 16 GB VRAM means it will remain useful for a long time.",Positive
AMD,What are you running (games/programs)? Are you sticking with the 1080 monitor?,Neutral
AMD,I just upgraded to a 9070xt from the 3080 and it's been great. You should really get a better monitor though because I think all these gpus are overkill for that.,Positive
AMD,I just picked up a 9070 XT for $570 at micro center this past weekend. If you go with a different brand I’m sure you can find it cheaper,Neutral
AMD,"9070 XT. That's the one and only answer.  The 5070 is easily outclassed by the 9070 XT so that shouldn't even be in consideration.  The 4080 Super is slightly better than the 9070 XT but not by much. The downside is that it comes with the horrible 12VHPWR connector that is known to go up in flames, you only get 3 months of warranty, and you'll be missing out on newer software features for upscaling and frame generation.  For a $70 price difference, I would say that the 9070 XT is worth it.",Negative
AMD,"If you generally play games from bigger studios and don't have any special feature needs like noise suppression AMD is probably the better bet. You won't be affected by stuff like AMD Noise suppression being broken for the past few months and can just enjoy the up front discount.  I'd also suggest checking out the basic 9070 if you're planning on staying at 1080p, it's not pushed to the limit like the XT to compete with the 5070Ti so you get some nice power savings for not much performance loss.",Positive
AMD,"Stood for a similar choice this week. Upgrading from my older RTX 3070 (8GB) to a better graphics card. I chose an RX 9070 XT 16 GB.  Expecting graphics cards to only increase in price in the coming months, so if you want to upgrade, better do it now than to wait longer.",Neutral
AMD,"4080S. ~5% behind 5080, though no MFG",Neutral
AMD,"Nvidia will show the new dlss and dynamic MFG today, lets see if it gives you some new ideias.",Neutral
AMD,"All of these cards are overkill at 1080p imo, so I'd go 5070 Asus TUF if you have to get one of these or just stick with your 3080, it's still a fantastic card. That 5070 will be virtually silent under load, it's a very well cooled card.  9070xt is better, but techpowerup doesn't have it THAT far ahead of the 5070, 12-15% on average between 1080p and 1440p, see here: https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asrock-radeon-rx-9070-xt-monster-hunter-wilds-edition/31.html  You say you don't care about Nvidia features, but realistically you probably should, if only just for the support they have. If you're not playing games with reflex and at least SOME upscaling enabled then you're doing yourself a disservice.  4080 would make more sense than the 5070ti at that skyhigh price, but either are insanely overkill for 1080p as I said, so I think you'd be better off spliting your budget with a monitor at that point.",Positive
AMD,Same boat actually.  I have the 3080 10gb and am considering the 5070ti.  I have no clue what the price hikes will be like and also am interested in the 50 supers coming in this year supposedly,Neutral
AMD,just buy the 3090. 24gb vram makes it no contest,Neutral
AMD,"Thank you for your input, the good part is that the 4080 Super is sold by a reputable business and an actual physical store, so they offer a 3-month warranty should the card fail. But besides that, I'm guessing that the base 5070 is more of a sidegrade in terms of performance instead of a leap forward like a 4080S would be to a 3080?  In conclusion, the 9070XT is the better option considering fps-per-dollar? I know it's cheaper because resellers here generally sell Nvidia cards at a higher profit margin than AMD cards.",Positive

AMD,"Yeah I'll probably look for another monitor all things considered. People say 1440p is way nicer than 1080p but idk if I'll see the difference, I went from playing on a 768p monitor in 2024 to a 1080p in the beginning of 2025 so that was definitely noticeable haha.  Also, how has your experience been with the 9070XT? It's been on my radar for a while but I haven't gone for it, yet.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't really mind not having MFG, and the 5080 itself seemed like a very small improvement to the 4080S without that tech in mind. If you had to choose between the 4080S and the 9070XT, which would you go for if the former was $70 more expensive than the latter?",Neutral
AMD,"I just checked that out and it seems like 50-series super cards aren't coming out anytime soon, but DLSS 4.5 integration is their next big thing.",Neutral
AMD,"Thank you for your input, I live in Colombia so most cards enter our market with insane overpriced values due to tariffs and taxes on electronic goods like these, so I feel like your comment is a more down to earth analysis of my position because of the 1080p monitor hahaha  I will definitely keep that in mind when I drive down to the pc hardware store tonight!",Positive
AMD,"Same situation, upgraded to 5070ti when I found a $675 open box at MC",Neutral
AMD,"Tom's Hardware has a ranking of raw performance on video cards that ranks every current video card against every other card, and here are their scores on 1080p gaming (the best current card, the RTX 5090, is 100%; everything else is a percentage of that performance):  RTX 4080 Super: 89.7%   RTX 5070 Ti: 85.7%   9070 XT: 85.6%   RTX 5070: 75.5%  So, if you're looking for the best gaming performance for the price, given those prices, the 9070XT is the best choice.",Neutral

AMD,"4080S, definitely",Positive
AMD,"Yup, I have a rtx 3080 but I will get a rtx 5070 ti probably. Lets see how the new tec will perform...   Dlss 4.5 will be for all RTX series since 2000. The Dynamic MFG until 6x will be for rtx 50 series only",Neutral
AMD,"Always happy to help!  If it were my money, I'm keeping the 3080 hands down, it's still very good and none of these cards are faster enough for how much they cost to justify the difference, but that's your call. 5070 is what, like 20% faster maybe?  https://www.techpowerup.com/review/asrock-radeon-rx-9070-xt-monster-hunter-wilds-edition/29.html  Different chart than what I linked before. We're talking paying almost $700 to get a 5070, to go from 122 fps on average to 146. If you went 9070xt it would be 122 fps to 163, or 170-180 for the 5070ti or the 4080.  Those aren't small jumps, but 122 is already VERY nice, and it's better than what the 5060ti or the 9060xt are doing as the current bang for buck 1080p/1440p recommendations.",Positive
AMD,"Don’t blame you, nice snag!!",Positive
AMD,"Dang, thanks, I'll take that into account, though I was checking the GPU Benchmark Hierarchy and it showed the 4080S as the 4th strongest card on the market, above even the 9070XT or the 5070TI.   I'm guessing that, compared to a less expensive, unused, newer card like the 9070XT then the AMD option has a little more weight.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah, thing is I haven't really had the chance to see what 1440p is actually like since all my friends stick to 1080p at 60hz, but I've been a little blessed with a good job this year so I wanted to buy myself a nice gpu to make the jump to 1440p",Positive

AMD,What happens if you reset to default all the settings in adrenaline?,Neutral
AMD,The new pc you listed is muuuuuch better return it and get the 9800x3d build.,Positive
AMD,"Just buy it for the board ram and cpu then change out the aio and the psu, and the case too if you want.",Neutral
AMD,"I would always recommend building a PC yourself. The 9070XT is a very good Price-to-performance card and while it has some AI features it is about equal to a 7900XT (5% faster). About the watercooling, AIOs are really safe, not like custom loops. Also, I'm pretty sure if it destroys your pc they will replace everythiing that was destroyed but the odds of that are like 1/1000000000 (I use watercooling)",Positive
AMD,For 850 bucks you're not doing better and tbh you did pretty good in this market,Negative
AMD,I’d return and get the other one you listed.  So much better.  I’ve been using AIO’s for a decade or so and have never had a leak.,Positive
AMD,you fucked up,Negative
AMD,"Thanks, do the 9070 xt's have problems with burning out their power connectors?",Neutral
AMD,Yeah the case on this current one is horrendous to work on the internals with. I dont even know what the psu is because its buried somwhere in the bottom section of the case.,Negative
AMD,"I've always built my own in the past. I think pre-builds started making more sense with AI ruining the market. I hate the idea of a pre-build but here we are. About the water cooling, does it have antifreeze in it? Theres a good chance this thing could be in below freezing temps if I'm out of state for work.",Negative
AMD,"Thanks, I'm mainly annoyed that I cant apply the $165 in best buy credits to the cost of the PC. Kinda had a feeling the associate was making crap up, my fault for not verifying I guess. Like, what the hell am I gonna get at best buy for $165?",Negative
AMD,Thanks lol. Bad deal on the PC I got?,Neutral
AMD,No they don't have anywhere near the power draw that 5090 or 4090's do.,Negative
AMD,"It’s a glycol mix, nothing to worry about",Neutral
AMD,"Do they expire? If not then just buy some games there. If they do, it'd pay for most of a 2tb ssd  As far as the RAM goes 16 is probably fine for now but if you want just pick up a single stick 16gb with either the same or better specs and they'll likely pair up fine.    You could have really done a lot worse buying a 850 dollar PC on light at best research overall. If you want to finance a 2k one you can but you're in a good spot overall imo and if it's the one I'm thinking of it's even just using retail parts. Have you booted it up yet? How's it doing with the games you actually want to play?",Neutral
AMD,Also you don't need to worry about waterdooling at all. Most of us all watercool our pc's with aio's and they're totally fine,Positive
AMD,Thank you. Any idea of the freeze point? Depending if its ethylene or propylene glycol and the mix ratio the freeze point could be all over the place.,Neutral
AMD,Its working pretty good for me for the older games I play. I tried mining XMR with it and was disappointed though. Would have been 3 months for a $13 payout. The energy cost today makes most mining non-profitable but I think of it as a space heater that helps pay for its energy cost. I'm mainly worried this might be my last chance for a long time to upgrade to a modern PC. I don't think the market is getting better any time soon. And mixing ram has very mixed reviews so also worried about buying a $200 ram stick and finding out they wont pair,Neutral
AMD,I guess if if the watercooling was installed by someone that cared it would be ok. This current one had a broken screw holding a panel on and the rear cooling fan was half ass plugged in to where the lights came on but it wouldnt spin up. I had to reroute the cables to have enough slack to plug it in properly. Idk if the water cooling systems use compression fittings but want to assume its probably installed half ass and will have to chase all the connections to make sure theyre torqued properly,Negative
AMD,No idea those details are never given  I know with Infloor heat I use 30% glycol mix which nets me -10c to -15 which is more than enough insurance where I am at. However I doubt the ratio is that high in an aio. Probably closer to 10% which would give you around 0 to -5c there about.,Neutral
AMD,"There are a few good upgrades you could do. For what you want though it sounds like a new graphics card is the main thing you need. I would recommend either a 9070 XT or a 5070 Ti, both of which can be handled by a 750W supply (you should double check what psu you have)  As you can see [here](https://www.techspot.com/review/3048-nvidia-5070-ti-vs-amd-9070-xt-with-dlss-fsr/#Cyberpunk_2077), the 5070 TI is a bit faster in Cyberpunk. That's at 1440p with the ultra ray tracing preset. However the 9070 XT is also over 100 cheaper, which makes the 5070 Ti 13% faster for 20% more money. Both are good options imo  You also could upgrade to 32GB of RAM, and/or upgrade the CPU. If you're happy with the frame rate your CPU can get in Cyberpunk though, pushing the graphics settings is mainly a GPU thing. I'd say upgrade the GPU first and see how that goes, then reevaluate whether you want to upgrade anything else",Positive
AMD,upgrade cooler and undervolt. plus a 9950x3d is CRAZY for a 4070ti super,Neutral
AMD,"No that's absurd, waste of money.",Negative
AMD,I bet you can just drop voltage. At least my raptor lake had excess voltage out of the box.  But if it's below 100 °C then does it really matter?,Negative
AMD,You can likely drop voltages a lot. My 14900k does 5.7/4.6 at 1.23V for example,Neutral
AMD,"I don't think that it's worth it as you won't really gain any performance.  I would highly recommend undervolting the 14900k to decrease its temperatures; there are many guides for doing this online. As an example of the effectiveness of undervolting, my 9800x3d with a quiet fan profile went from 80-85C under load to 60-65C from a modest -23% curve with no performance loss",Negative
AMD,"At some point you are going to have to learn how your hardware works, rather than trying to buy good performance. Either learn how to undervolt your cpu, improve your cooling or set a lower power limit. Buying a new hardware platform is an absolute waste of money even if you are a nepo baby.",Negative
AMD,"You should just turn off Hwinfo if the temperature is bothering you. Modern it/R9 CPUs are built to run close to thermal limit to give you the highest possible speed for the task.   Literally the only possible way of getting them way under that limit is a delidding mod and a direct die water cooling custom loop, but that most likely won't get you more performance.",Negative
AMD,Without more details it’s hard to tell but you shouldn’t expect any better performance from a 9950X3D than you currently have.  Might even be worse,Negative
AMD,"It may be that either the cooler isn't quite up to the task for an i9 or that your computer case doesn't have adequate airflow for such a powerful processor.        I used to use an Antec Nine Hundred when I had processors less powerful than an i5. When I upgraded to a motherboard with an i5 processor, I couldn't get the Antec cool enough no matter what I did. So, I sold it and bought a Phantex Enthoo case. I installed the same motherboard in that case, filled all the vent bays with fans and everything was fine. I even used the same CPU cooler on the motherboard that it already had in the Antec case.    I think the Enthoo case having vents in the bottom and top as well as the usual front and back made a big difference.",Neutral
AMD,"As others have probably already pointed out the newish Ryzen 9s will make just as much or more heat just find a quiet fan or fans for the air cooler or radiator or lots of/bigger fans and keep them turned down low and it’ll be quieter, more cores will help with stuttering if it’s cpu related, have some cores working on editing and another will be running the mouse.",Neutral
AMD,"What are your drives? It seems to me you have other issues that will just transfer over to the AMD. Intel is still the undisputed king of productivity and the 14900k is no joke, at best you'd be side-grading. I wonder if you're saturating your drives and/or memory and causing the studders.  You need to run some telemetry (HWinfo or the like) and see if you're 100% on drives or memory, or possibly both.",Neutral
AMD,For workloads you can’t beat the 9950x3d and your temps will go down especially if you tweak PBO with a -20 offset. I just made the switch after my 14900kf shit the bed even after updating the microcode and manually setting all my settings from day one.,Negative
AMD,"The heat isn't really an issue I just stated that as I'm used to lower temps as I came from an i7... My main concern which I probably should've stated better was for workflow. During heavy editing session, I can get lag/delay whenever I do a bulk of photos, masking with the delay can get annoying and with some video editing I notice a slight lag also. Like I'll be clicking to mask and my mouse would freeze for a bit then come back or it'll have some input lag causing editing to be annoying as it's not as precise due to the lag.

AMD,Biased opinion in this subreddit aside. Intel is still generally king for workload where amd is king for gaming. Long as the 14th gen doesn't kill itself like the 13th which I'm pretty sure it will id run what you have for now. If and when the 14th burns itself out id make different decisions based on tech available at that time.   Came from intels until the 13th burned itself out and I shoved a 12th in its slot and built an entirely new 9800X3D pc for gaming.  Sidenote if it does burn out you can put an i7 12th gen in the board instead of buying a new pc.,Neutral
AMD,"That is very likely not a platform issue. I would start by isolating usb devices. Leave only mouse and keyboard and see if it persists. It's not the most likely cause but it's incredibly easy to check.  Monitor cable may also be at fault. If you have a replacement make sure it's rated for the bandwidth and if not you may have to buy one. In case you have to buy one to check,  you can move this step to later in diagnostics",Neutral
AMD,"I see. I have a similar problem with my PC in that most of the time, it runs cool, below any threshold that I worry about.  I know that my CPU isn't supposed to hit its performance limit until it reaches 100 degrees Celcius. Most of the time, it doesn't get above 60 C, even in gaming. Except when I play my currently most demanding game for my system - Oblivion Remastered.  In Oblivion Remastered, if I tried to play it with all the settings at maximum, the CPU temps would get really close to 100 C and I would see weird glitches in the game and stuttering at times.  I quit playing it for a while, but then I read somewhere that if you turn the game visual settings down a tick below max on each one except the ones for hair and the one that makes moving things like cloth and such look more realistic - those you turn way down - it will make a big difference. It sure did. Now, the game doesn't heat my system up beyond 80 C and then only for a brief time.  I'm running the game with a 2060 Super, so I'm trying to use the ray tracing effects in the game, but it's a pretty demanding thing for my setup to do, especially with hair and cloth modeling turned on max.  In terms of the processors you are asking about, the Core i9-14900K and the Ryzen 9 are quite comparable in terms of specs. i9 has more of some things and Ryzen 9 has more of other things, but the net result is so close that I don't think it justifies a CPU swap in terms of performance. In terms of heat production, the i9 is a little bit cooler and uses a little less power than the Ryzen 9.  I have noticed that trend myself over the years. Every time I upgraded to a signifcantly more powerful CPU, I had to make other changes to deal with the computer getting hotter.",Negative

AMD,Why is there only 1GB of RAM seen by the OS? Is that the max amount the first AMD64 could handle at the time? I thought the 64-bit architecture was theoretically supposed to be able to handle up to 4TB of RAM?,Neutral
AMD,Oh wow.  You're going to upset a lot of Intel fan-bois by stating fact that AMD64 destroyed Intel's Itanium CPUs.  Here's the back story as told by the guy that created Task Manager.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyX8TO3awfw,Negative
AMD,Itanium had lackluster performance for its own native software as well!,Negative
AMD,"The Greatest Generation had a word for what IA64 became, a ""boondoggle"". It's where something shifts and drifts so far from its original intention, becoming so complex and expensive along the way, that it no longer fulfills any of it.  What Intel wanted and what HP wanted were well aligned. HP wanted a server/high-performance computing (HPC) product to replace the older PA-RISC, while Intel wanted a monopolised line of products it could name its price on.  Itanium essentially killed every other RISC architecture of the 1990s. MIPS was sold off by Silicon Graphics, and Compaq (owners of DEC) ended work on the Alpha, both intending their future HPC machines to be IA-64. Of the RISC workstation platforms of the 1990s, only SPARC remained in development, by Sun Microsystems (soon to be gobbled by Oracle).  The point behind IA64's ""EPIC"" (explicitly parallel instruction set computer) architecture was to move almost all the CPU's instruction handling front end into software, let the compiler handle it all once then it didn't have to be done every time the code ran. So the instruction stream had to already have all its parallelism worked out, the compiler needed intimate details of the CPU's architecture.  By the time Merced actually shipped, Intel was de-hyping it in every presentation. The narrative became ""Wait for McKinley, though buy Merced now if you want to get familiarity with IA-64"". Merced had become so large on silicon that Intel's 180 nm process couldn't actually manufacture it so it starte being cut back. IA32 hardware support was first to go, but then the caches got trimmed, the exact same problem AMD was to later have with Bulldozer - and the exact same outcome.  On natively compiled IA-64 bit code against natively compiled IA-32 code a piddly little AMD K6-III from three or four years earlier at just 450 MHz was up to twice as fast as Merced running at 800 MHz. In other tests, Merced was four times faster than AMD's market-leading Athlon.  Well, anyway, we're getting a bit long and you're getting a bit bored. McKinley, the version Intel had wanted to make, fixed most of this and really was a HPC floating point monster. McKinley went more or less unchanged to 130 and 90 nm as Madison, which was dual-core and had larger L2 caches.  The future was actually looking bright for Itanium in 2001, even after Intel had cut its revenue forecast for Itanium from $35 billion in 2002 (1999 projection) to $7 billion by 2005 (2001 projection). Actual sales figures, by 2005, were barely over $2 billion.  Three things conspired against it.  1. If you wanted Itanium, you went to Intel, and Intel's pricing was catastrophic. You could buy a quad-socket Xeon system for the price of a dual-socket Itanium, and the Xeons would be faster. 2. Intel had not invited AMD to the Itanium party, when IA64 took over the world, as Intel felt was its entitlement, it would be an Intel monopoly. AMD disagreed here, so AMD extended IA-32 into AMD64, a drop-in replacement for existing systems in almost all cases. In AMD's K8-sporting Opteron's first year, it out-sold Itanium four to one: Michael Dell canned his exclusivity agreement with Intel and started selling Opteron servers. Dell wanted to sell servers, after all. 3. Very much unwilling to have Intel in control of the destiny of Windows, Bill Gates went on stage and told the world that WindowsXP's future updates would support one 64-bit architecture, and it was AMD's. Intel's share price was down over 5% by the time Gates had done speaking!  Microsoft did make a version of the NT6 codebase for IA64, but never a client version, only ever Server 2008 (NT6.0) and Server 2008R2 (NT6.1)  Itanium did lumber on, with the basic Madison architecture being more or less unchanged as it shrank to new processes, gained more cores, etc. The last Itanium, the 9700-family, was ""Kittson"" in 2017. The highest model ran at 2.66 GHz and had 8 cores. Intel's top end Xeon of 2017, based on Skylake-SP, had up to 28 cores.  The final shipping system was the HPE Integrity server/HPC, which stopped accepting IA-64 orders in 2021 and, since 2015, had been the only shipping IA-64 product. Linux removed IA-64 from mainline kernel support in 2021, Linus Torvalds quipping:  *""HPE no longer accepts orders for new Itanium hardware, and Intel stopped accepting orders a year ago. While Intel is still officially shipping chips until July 29, 2021, it's unlikely that any such orders actually exist. It's dead, Jim.""*",Neutral
AMD,"Is this in a VM?  I remember trying to install Windows 7 on a 1st gen Ryzen, a config that is officially supported and it absolutely did not like the USB implementation.

AMD,"System starts up with that CPU ...   Nearly 4Ghz, 8 Cores, 16 threads and drawing 65w without overclocking.  ... Yep, looks normal.  That would look like science fiction in a 2003 system  - from memory and quick research you would need dual Xeon's to even come close to the performance for a higher power draw - But at least the ram quantity would look sane.",Neutral

AMD,Not an Intel fanboy but OP's fact checking sucks. The licensing agreement between Intel and AMD preceds the IA-64 debacle and IA-64 never meant to be backwards compatible to begin with.

AMD,"I actually was also deciding between both, i eventually decided to remain team red and got a 9060 xt 16gb ver. Im in opinion it was really worth it, the frame gen is great, not to mention the fsr 4. Amd did really great with this card, and it meets all my framerate needs.  Now if you prefer ray tracing, definitely go for the 5070, its slightly more expensive but for rt or dlss its worth it, And if you are into video editing. (The general differences is that the 5070 is like 25 precent ish more powerful than the 9060). Based on your 5600, i'd say its better to get a 9060 to avoid some bottlenecking",Positive
AMD,"5070, VRAM matter when comparing Cards with a similar Performance, and the 5070 have much more Performance than the 9060XT.",Positive
AMD,"Two different price and performance brackets. If you have the funds go for either 5070 or 9070 non xt. Non xt is better with vram so you don't risk bottlenecks, 5070 is better on RT on a couple of games, and does better on path tracing unless you run out of vram which is a huge chance to do so. In my personal experience with both a 9070xt And 5070ti, AMD had better driver stability this generation, but this may not apply to you.  Overall I recommend 9070 over a 5070. And if funds are lower 9060xt over a 5060ti. Don't do 9060xt 8gb, it's an unfortunate GPU that should have not existed along 5060ti 8gb.",Neutral
AMD,"I have the same CPU, and I have the 5070. If I could choose again I would go with the 9060xt, only for the Vram upgrade alone, just to somewhat future proof my build. 12gb is fine right now, 16gb would of been the better bet.",Neutral
AMD,isn't 9070 non xt selling around the same as 5070. check open box etc newegg. otherwise 5070 for tier higher horsepower.,Neutral

I was trying to upgrade the Kernel to 6.18.1 (using the app Mainline Kernels), but it kept failing on a virtual box dkms. I then spent way too much time trying to resolve the virtual box issue.  Eventually I kinda gave up on that and installed 6.14.0-37 from the Update Manager, and that worked. Fixed the previous issues I had with the installs.  After a reset, HL2 works fine as does Tempest Rising. Doom: The Dark Ages now just crashes back to steam, but at least now I can play a bit more with it, knowing my 9070XT has been mostly fixed.  UP next:   Try to install 6.18.1   Get ready (back-up system) for Mint 22.3",Positive
AMD,From 6.14.0-37 I was able to update to 6.18.1 and Doom runs perfect. I was able to crank the graphics up to Ultra Nightmare at 1920 with 60fps.   I learnt a few things during this.    I had kinda just assumed that the Update Manager would always have the most recent kernel available to me. Turns out...not so much. I'll have to start paying much closer attention to releases now.

AMD,"All I want from AMD is a balanced APU, a solid CPU and a solid GPU. I genuinely don’t understand this weird obsession companies have with slapping a midrange GPU next to an absurdly overkill CPU. Why can’t we get a Ryzen 5 or Ryzen 7 level CPU paired with something like an 8060S?   Instead, it’s always a top of the lone Ryzen 9 or Intel i9 equivalent paired with what’s basically a midrange GPU. All that does is jack up the cost for no real benefit and push the final price way higher than it needs to be. A 12 core CPU driving a 60 TFLOP GPU is still massive overkill, and it just feels like wasted silicon and money to me.",Negative

Installed Bazzite, logged in to Steam, and was gaming within minutes.  The only lingering flaw - and granted, it IS a pretty major flaw at the moment considering the use case - is that Sleep doesn't work properly and seems to cut power to both USB and the network card even after waking. I'm confident I'll resolve whatever the issue is, but until then, being sure to power down after every session isn't a very difficult thing to do, especially since the only thing I'm using it for is gaming.",Neutral

AMD,I was looking into this and there is a use case you may be missing. This will give you steam machine performance in a 2-3L PC case. Getting a dGPU into something like the MS-A2 (closest comparison I can come up with easily) requires jumping through a ton of hoops and will be more expensive besides.   This has a very niche use case compared to what you suggested and if money is a concern at all your solution is probably better.,Neutral
AMD,You will most likely be able to grab a cheap Chinese mini pc which will beat any cpu + gpu combo in terms of value and size . As a 1080p steam box it would be great heck even the current 870m is decent enough for 1080p gaming . An 8745h machine is like $350 for a fully built system.

AMD,"Radeon's most successful period was under AMD from 2008-2013. They carried AMD for a lot of that time while their CPU division faltered.  Also ATI were in financial trouble when AMD bought them, so it was unlikely they could have continued without a buyout.",Neutral
AMD,"It's cool. Using it exclusively for llm models. It acts as the backend for OpenWeb uI. Since the nic is only 5Gb, I keep the models on the device. Eventually I'm going to put it in another case so I can use the x4 slot for a 25G card and centralize my model storage.  But performance is strong all things considered. It doesn't chug when trying to generate a result. I think the biggest delay is the time from when it loads the model requested into memory before it starts processing",Positive
AMD,"Looking through the CES news, I saw that AMD teased a reference dev box. They called it the Ryzen AI Halo. A AI Max+ 395 with 128GB. If there is even just a hint of them dropping this thing with a ""reasonable"" price tag in Germany, I'll just grab one of those.  My hopes for a decent sub-2L chassis with a 388 and 64GB of RAM feel rather slim. I rather avoid the possibility of filing a warranty claim against a Chinese brand.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m still waiting to see what we actually get from the steam machine personally, We still need specs and price point.

AMD,"Honestly, the ms-02 ultra is what I was considering if using dgpu but it is almost twice the size. I would be hard pressed to beat the 3090 in my 15L so it needs to be a usff case or be close to matching my current rig in a slightly larger form factor (2-5L).",Neutral
AMD,Performance wise I have no clue but design wise it fills the same general market.  Hits in the same ballpark as a mobile 3060.

AMD,They’d lagged a bit but they still competed in the high end and in the early 2000s made halo products like the 9800 XT.

AMD,"If you don't mind asking, which split specifically are you using for *glm-4.7 q2*?",Neutral
AMD,"I mean what would you need it for, in your use case? Is it for Jellyfin to stream faster?",Neutral
AMD,"No, jellyfin does not need that much bandwidth; many tvs come with only 100 Mbit ethernet, and the streaming platform with the highest quality streams (Apple TV) top at about 50 Mbit.  The GP gave a hint: centrally storing LLM models. These files can be huge (e.g. gpt-oss-120b has ~64 GB, llama-3.3-70b has ~37 GB, glm-4.7 depending on quantization can have 100-250 GB), so you need as much bandwidth as possible when loading them over network.",Neutral
AMD,"If AMD ever gets it together, the NPU could be used to offload AMD noise reduction and can also cleanup live webcam images too.  Otherwise, it has better uses in a more integrated system like a laptop.   Just wait until dGPUs have a type of NPU (much smaller and tailored to a very specific workload) directly integrated into the display engines to analyze images/frames (could support multi-frame accumulation and also denoise that) on the fly and apply transparent (to game/app) post-processing.

AMD,>they should just name it a 9700g and call it a day.   You're deluding yourself if you think that the desktop SKUs won't switch to the new naming convention once they have a CoPilot+ certified NPU in them. That's the only reason Zen 5 desktop isn't using the same naming scheme.,Neutral
AMD,It doesn’t support anything special on the laptops so I don’t expect it will anything on desktop either.,Negative

AMD,I've seen people do framegen on the iGPU so as not to burden the discrete gpu with it.   Whether it's actually worth it's anyone's guess.,Neutral
AMD,"No. That would just be a separate engineered die.   Ryzen desktop series are chiplet based. There’s a cpu chiplet connected to an i/o die chiplet on an am4/am5 socket. Note that zen4/5 include a small 2 CU gpu in the cpu die chiplet for basic video output purposes.   Ryzen mobile series are monolithic, no chiplets. Its just one single chip with up to a 12 CU gpu in it.

AMD,"That's correct. I've got a 8700G and that was touted as 'the first desktop CPU with a NPU' back at launch (8600G is the weaker sibling, also has an NPU and was launched at the same date). Combined TOPS of 39, which is suspiciously just 1 short to qualify for Copilot+... Doesn't matter though, since I'm using Linux anyway 🙂",Neutral

AMD,"Smart Access Memory is AMD's term for Resizable BAR,  which allows the CPU to access the GPU's VRAM directly.

AMD,Similar in what way,Neutral
AMD,It’s still not handled by the NPU tho,Neutral
AMD,"Oh wow, nice to know",Positive
AMD,interesting  I did not know,Neutral
AMD,smart access video is hybrid processing..,Neutral
AMD,"let me have my fun, it's night time",Positive
AMD,"No it just allows the buffer to be **resizeable** the access remains the same.  And no they did not mention the iGPU once, they said NPU. And even if it could, what would the benefit be? Games render using one GPU or the other, not both. So why access an inactive GPU's VRAM data? Even if you could write to it like extra memory, that defeats the entire point of VRAM, it's just far far too slow, it would kill performance.  So again what are THEY talking about?",Neutral
AMD,"BAR = Base Address Register.  In short, it's the address range of system memory that gets mapped to graphics memory.  Which part of graphics memory it points to is changed as required.  The size of the register is relatively small by default, because the system address range it occupies is no longer accessible as normal RAM, and with a 32-bit system that only has 4GB of address space, reserving a large chunk of that space for mapped graphics memory will impact system performance.  Resizable BAR just means you can change the size of that register, so that you can write to more of the graphics memory at once, without changing the mapping.  With a 64-bit operating system, you have plenty of address space that doesn't go anywhere near physical memory to work with, so you can map the entire size of the graphics memory to a system address without causing any issues.  AMD's SAM *uses* resizable BAR functionality, but is not simply their label for it.  There's a bit more going on in what they do with it, which is why AMD cards designed with SAM in mind gain more than other cards that merely encounter a larger BAR.  An exception can be made for modern Intel cards, which were designed with a large BAR in mind, and are actually crippled with a small one.  This is more them being lazy on implementing VRAM access properly for a small BAR than them gaining performance from a large BAR.  In all cases, the graphics memory is accessed ""directly"".  It's only a question of how large the mapped address area is, and where in VRAM it's pointing at any given moment.",Neutral
AMD,"Not yét, however DirectML will supposedly enable this.",Neutral

AMD,"It will improve, but not by an appreciable amount, and won’t perform significantly better than the 8core X3D part.   As for productivity, some benchmarks might see some gains. But you’ll find a few edge cases where the performance would skyrocket just because some memory bound dataset dealing with random data happens to get an unexpectedly high hit rate on the L3.   The majority of them will however perform near identically. Games are typically “Low IPC” workloads. Not much stuff being done, but it needs to react to things fast.  But productivity software is “High IPC” and the optimization targets in the software and even the compilers simply aren’t designing for CPUs that have this much L3 cache.   They know what a normal CPUs latencies are, and ensure their software is always able to keep the average CPU engine fully fed never waiting for data.  AMD offers some X3D server parts for certain workloads. And they have X3D on all the CCDs. But they aren’t nearly as popular as the classic ones.",Negative

For gaming, you already have enough cores with 3d cache on a 9950x3d, same for (general) productive work, we don't know about the latency between both cdcs yet.  What will gain a massive amount of performance is stuff that is built to use the L3 cache because now you have double the amount of cdc then before.  Still probably better to wait for ZEN6.",Neutral
AMD,"It will improve gaming performance in all of the games where, at stock, the 9800X3D out-performed the 9950X3D.  The ""at stock"" means in the absence of something like *Process Lasso* to ensure the game only ran on the CCD with V-cache, which erases the deficit already.  Outside of that scenario, there are few games which will run faster on the 9950X3D2 over a properly scheduled 9950X3D.  At least right now.",Positive
AMD,"Some games that can utilize it will improve significantly, something like Star Citizen I imagine would love the extra cache.  Other games will improve immensely compared to the 50/50 x3d-chips like the 7900x3d simply because their OS can't mess up the core-parking since both chiplets are x3d now.  Still other games will have minor improvements from the small uplift in boost clock.  If you're into pure productivity use, a non x3d-chip is probably the way to go as it clocks higher and will chew through serial tasks faster. Maybe it makes a difference if you're doing 3d-art stuff, not sure.",Positive
AMD,It's for nothing basically.. just for some niche apps,Negative
AMD,"It will be interesting to see if there are any gaming benefits, but I'm sure there are applications that will use all that sweet cache. Probably rendering and handbrake for a start. 9800x3d, or rather 9850x3d now might still be the best gaming cpu.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, but there's a couple ways to get around it. Besides there's some people that keep asking for it, and it will make an interesting baseline for the next couple CPU gens.   Rumors exist future architectures may package the CCDs closer together to mitigate the latency. Plus we are getting more cores per CCD.",Positive
AMD,"Yes. This is only a problem because people talk as if X3D is black magic. It just extra L3 cache. The vertically stacked ""3D"" part is just how they're able to squeeze that more cache onto the die.  L3 cache is orders of magnitude faster than even RAM, so any time the CPU can get the data it needs from cache instead of even having to go out to RAM, you get better performance. This applies to everything a CPU does, as well, not just gaming. Gaming simply benefits greatly because, as a workload, it tends to use a lot of the same data over and over again, which means you get a lot of cache hits. A bigger cache means more data can be stored and, the chance of a cache hit versus a miss is greater, as a result. That's it. The entire secret sauce to X3D.  The reason already that the second CCD is disabled is because of the two pools of cache are separate. If a thread on CCD0 requests data, it's added to the the cache on CCD0. If a thread on CCD1 requests the same data, that's not in *its* cache, so you either call it a miss and move on or cross over the fabric to check the cache on CCD0. That instantly slows it down, though, to the point where you might as well have pulled it fresh from memory. Therefore, the way to extract the most performance is to make sure all the threads that are accessing the same cached data are using the same pool of cache, and the way you do that on a multi CCD design is to disable the other CCD.  Adding more cache to the second CCD doesn't solve this problem. The existing cache on the second CCD could already be utilized, if it made any sense to, and all that mattered was more cache overall. It just makes it so that any thread, regardless of which CCD it's on, has access to a large pool of cache. But, you would still want to confine the work for a single application entirely to one CCD to extract the most benefit. It doesn't help gaming at all. It could have some limited productivity benefits.",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe for gaming, but if you use these for compute intensive work and know how to nice your processes, they will go lightning fast.",Positive
AMD,"I think it was not a useful change since each CCD has separate L3 cache so going across the infinity fabric means not using the same cache and adding latency. AMD said they didn't think it would be a useful configuration.  But ""give the people what they want"" is a saying for a reason and people keep begging for both CCDs to be 3D cache",Negative
AMD,"No. Cache is not something that adding more of can hurt. The rest of the die is rumored to be the same, just now both dies have 96MB L3 cache instead of just the one.   Will some workloads *not benefit*? Maybe. But this change doesn't *add* latency. The latency you speak of is already there with your 9950x3d. (Ok.. +2ns to 3DV cache vs the standard L3 layer).",Neutral

The X3D CCD is chosen, obviously, because of the higher pool of cache, but either crossing CCDs and/or using two separate pools of cache would slow down performance, and that's still going to be a problem, regardless of if you added more cache to the second CCD. You could potentially play two games at the same time, both with the performance of a 9800X3D, each with their own CCD, but that would obviously be a fairly niche use case.",Neutral

AMD,"It's not about the latency that's added due to the large cache he's talking about, it's about cross talk CCD latency aka infinity fabric and I assume also specifically for games.  Most games only use a few threads and we already park the 2nd CCD due to it missing the cache + cross talk latency, so it begs the question how much does adding a second 3d cache really benefit that? If we stop parking the cores we get the cross talk latency which is probably gonna be worse in that scenario, especially because games are very latency sensitive.",Neutral
AMD,You didn't get his question,Neutral
AMD,"Actually it can hurt. More cache, more area, more latency. There will be a point on the cost benefit curve when it crosses from a positive into a negative.  At 5ghz there is only enough time for the signal to travel about 3-4 centimeters before the next cycle begins. You need things to be physical close, or you have to wait cycles in between requests. The more area you add, the more cycles you need to wait.  Just think about it logically, take the supposition to the extreme; imagine an infinite cache, the latency would be infinite.  -----  In this case its not adding more cache to the same ccd, but to the other ccd that lacks it. There wont be any additional latency concerns, so it should be a net positive. However, for anything that sits on one ccd, its not going to help at all. On ryzen, each ccd can only write to its own caches. One ccd can not go and write to the other ccd. It can however snoop the cache of the other ccd(and it must to ensure memory coherency), but this adds cross talk over the infinity fabric. Too much cross talk can likewise hurt performance instead of help. Again i dont think this will be an issue in this case. Its just there is such a thing as too much cache.",Negative
AMD,Unfortunately you still need to worry about making sure the game is only running on 1 CCD. I have a dual CCD CPU (7900) and every time a game is split between CCDs it stutters. It will do the same even if both CCDs have V-Cache.,Negative
AMD,"i thought both don't get 3d cache  they would just doubling the size of the v cache on one ccd ,so core parking is still a issue , i have a 9950x3d and id never upgrade other then finding a way to give both ccds v cache to make core parking a thing of the past but gaining a few Fps due to a double sized vcache on one CCD is just a money grabbing refresh",Negative

AMD,"You still won't want game threads crossing CCDs. The SerDes interconnect is still not fast enough, nor does it offer enough throughput for cache-cache transfers (and doesn't have this capability). All data will hit system memory if it needs to traverse another CCD. This is a significant latency hit vs V-cache, at least for first transfers. After that, data should be in both CCDs' caches, but there's not really a good way to control workloads with dependencies without locking to a single CCD. Otherwise, threads on both CCDs will stall as they wait for data from one another, traversing system memory, as all cached data is present in RAM.  Parallel ops with independent workloads can task both CCDs without much issue.  EDIT: There might be a way to optimize traffic in software, if it's intelligent and catches op dependencies from traversing CCDs. But, as usual, this has overhead and can still allow some edge cases to cross. Better to have some type of data traffic QoS than nothing though or we're back to parking the other CCD, which seems wasteful to me. Background tasks should operate on the secondary CCD at minimum.

AMD,Is a 16c part likely to be a gamer CPU?,Neutral
AMD,"It’s the same philosophy of taxation.  Extract the money from people whom can afford it and are most benefitted from the government so you can subsidize those who can’t.   Is it feasible or even fair that a company like Apple Pay the same licensing cost to use enterprise software as a single employment entrepreneur?   If I’m a software company who’s enabling you to make MILLIONS off of my product, I want a few thousands of that.  But I still want to sell my product to the single person startup, so I charge him less.   And for educational institutions, personal, or non-profit use, I give the licences for free or heavily discounted.",Neutral

AMD,Which south american country was it that was just torching the poor when the olympics came by?,Negative
AMD,"Hmm. I suppose it depends on how that's implemented. I want to see AMD link CCDs together via direct communication, instead of having to hit RAM for every data sync between CCDs. Fanout/sea-of-wires can certainly move in this direction, but honestly, an expensive active interposer or active bridge die might be the only way to get more benefits. A lot of hardware logic is actually needed to bridge CCDs, so maybe AMD doesn't feel it's worth the transistor cost, as each design has strict transistor budgets. Those budgets are often used to further compute performance.  A full 16-core CCD is likely what will be needed without all of the expensive silicon. That's just how it goes, I think.",Neutral
AMD,I'm here crossing my fingers that we will get AM5 CPU's with that. I would be very happy if I could go from my 7800X3D to another X3D with 12+ cores if rumors are to be believed. Planning on using my AM5 motherboard as far as possible.,Positive
AMD,???,Neutral
AMD,"perhaps the next step is including cache on the IO die to reduce inter CCD latency and low power cores to reduce idle power draw.   zen 5 chiplet design it's an improved zen 2 layout, that layout was good for increase core count for cheap (3950X), however SerDes interface is showing its limitations.",Neutral

I remember a laptop I had with a socketed Athlon II CPU, but with its anemic GPU, it wasn't top of the line or anything.       Maybe the A-series chips were decent in laptops? From my hazy memory, I associate those older AMD laptops with very cheap Compaq and HP laptops. I don't remember how many higher-quality laptops used AMD back then.",Negative
AMD,"Which would be cool if they're cheaper for the user, but they're not, certainly not for the Framework 13 which is what I was looking at, going from the 7640U to the AI 5 340 costs $130 extra, and for that I get... what, half the CPU cores dropped to compact versions AND the GPU chopped in half? It's not like the clockspeed of the GPU doubled (not even close, 2600 vs 2900 MHz) either so ain't no way that half assed version is going to totally match the old one, nevermind *improve* as one might expect when buying something newer.  So in my case since at the time the 7640U model was constantly going in and out of stock while the AI 5 340 just costs more for less I ended up splitting the difference and getting the Core Ultra 5 125H model instead, at least Intel only cut 12.5% of the GPU cores instead of 50% when dropping from the 7 tier to the 5 tier.",Negative

Difficult with a cloud based service and you might not want meeting conversations going up to the cloud.  Microsoft's controversial 'recall' function is another example. You don't want your documents and screenshots sent to a cloud. Microsoft states *Recall* ""operates directly on your device, utilizing the *NPU*"".   Privacy aside you can't do basic things like background blur in real-time with a cloud based model and you could do that on a GPU but why run a GPU for an hour when you can run the NPU in just a few watts.  You do not want to spin up a power hungry GPU for every AI task a consumer might need and that's why NPUs exist and will continue to exist.  If you don't see a use for an NPU it is only a failure of imagination where you have not been able to think of a continuous background AI task that might be useful.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo.

The problem is also that AMD also has disaggregated their compute from their IMC, and yet has *better* latency on *less advanced* packaging.   >The controversy here isn't that Intel failed to push frequency; it is that they deliberately chose to execute a hard pivot away from the monolithic brute force strategy of Raptor Lake to a disaggregated chiplet design that prioritizes area efficiency and performance-per-watt over raw, latency-sensitive throughput.

Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in.

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort. Ironically I probably would have made out a lot better buying a 5700X3D or a 5800X3D and the 9070XT and keeping my AM4 board and DDR4 RAM and saving $600.",Positive

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.

I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

This is verifiably bullshit because nothing about mobile processors protects them from wrong voltage received because of wrong LLC settings.  \>CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve  If you do not know that Intel is requesting high voltage to avoid insufficient voltage before frequency boost you do not know jack shit. It is literally what happens under description ""**Microcode and BIOS code requesting elevated core voltages which can cause Vmin shift especially during periods of idle and/or light activity**"" and there is a video proof of that with an oscilloscope.

If the US does that, I don't really see an issue.  The MAGA part was a half hearted comment, made to follow the weirdness of the whole situation and comment I was replying on as well. As I said in a separate post:  ""It's so strange to me that we've hit a spot in consumer and enterprise computing where politics is now a factor (speaking about how decisions beyond national security are now driven by politics and trying to be on the right side at any moment when it matters). It's a different game when companies have to worry about that side, far too many consumers make decisions based on their politics when all that does is cause other issues. Obviously I won't go farther than that in a tech focused discussion lol, but I will say again that it's a different game and I don't think anyone wins if it becomes the norm.""  I'm going to add, light heartedly, I do hope we see AMD/nVidia/Qualcomm/etc manufactured and final packaged products coming out of Intel Foundries one day. I'm not sure how or if it will work, but the situation seems dead set not to allow significant further nodes beyond 2 nm or packaging to occur outside of North America. If the US wants viable national chip production, Intel is the better option, I hope it works out in a way that maintains design level competition while meeting national security goals.",Neutral

AMD,"u/Chelostyles Thank you for your inquiry regarding the CPU and RAM upgrade for your Dell Vostro 3670. As much as I'd like to provide my technical insights on this upgrade path, I'm not in a position to provide specific suggestions since this involves hardware modifications to an OEM system.  For the best compatibility outcome and to ensure optimal system performance, I strongly recommend reaching out to your system manufacturer directly. They can provide definitive guidance on supported CPU upgrades (i5-8400 to i7-9700) and maximum RAM configurations for your specific model. We don't want to inadvertently bypass any warranty terms and conditions on your system by providing modification recommendations that might affect your coverage.  Your system manufacturer's technical support team will have access to the exact specifications, BIOS compatibility matrices, and supported hardware configurations for your Vostro 3670 model. They can confirm whether the motherboard supports the i7-9700, the maximum RAM capacity (64GB vs 128GB), and any potential limitations or requirements for these upgrades.  This approach ensures you get accurate, manufacturer-validated information while maintaining your system's warranty protection.",Neutral
AMD,"u/I_like_carsyay  XPS 15 9530 hardware does support Resizable BAR, which is why Intel's system detection shows it as available for both your Arc A370M and Iris Xe graphics.

This approach ensures optimal system performance while reducing complexity for users. I recommend checking for the latest BIOS updates from your OEM's support site and contacting their technical support team, as they would have the most current information about how ReBAR is implemented on your specific model and whether any additional configuration steps are needed to fully utilize this feature.     I've posted an article below in case you haven't yet come across it:  **Helpful Resources:**  *  [What Is Resizable BAR and How Do I Enable It?](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000090831/graphics.html)",Neutral

AMD,"The most important characteristics of a laptop are battery life ( power efficiency) and screen quality. That is what sells ( non apple ) clamshells.    All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake. I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive

AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance.

AMD,"Two things can be true at the same time. Arrow lake has legitimately improved since it launched last year, and Intel is portraying it in the best, most optimal light they can that is probably not representative of a broad spectrum of games reviewed by a third party.   It would be interesting to get a retest of arrow lake now, but I dunno if it is worth the time investment for some reviewer like TPU or HWUB to re-review a relatively poor platform that’s already halfway out the door.",Positive
AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral
AMD,What do you mean by gaslighting in this case?,Negative
AMD,"The answer depends on whether or not you're a ""next-gen AI gamer"" (apparently that means 1080p avg fps with a RTX 5090).",Neutral
AMD,I doubt they would give false numbers. Those are probably what you get with the setup they list in fine print. Also they pretty clearly show the 3dx parts are faster in gaming. But they have probably picked examples that show them in a good light.   There is nothing wrong per se in the arrow lake lineup. In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all. The issue that destroyed the image of arrow lake is that the previous generation was often faster in gaming. That made every reviewer give it bad overall reviews.,Neutral
AMD,Wait till refresh comes out in December... Memory latency lower and performance boosted. Price also lower... Wish it could come to the old chips but it architecturally cant. :(,Negative
AMD,"generally they cherry pick, so maybe the demo they use is process heavy with minimal I/O (arrow's biggest performance hit is memory movement). if you manage to keep memory movement low core performance is actually really good on arrow lake. it just gets massacred by d2d and NGU latency, which they don't get a pass for but its unfortunate that decent core designs are held back severely by packaging.",Negative

That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Negative
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit.

AMD,"Hi all,  I ordered a contact frame from Thermal Grizzly because the temperature of my CPU wasn’t great, and I was tired of the fan noise.   I installed the contact frame in August, and everything was fine until two weeks ago, when the desktop suddenly stopped booting. The fans were spinning, but there was no POST, no debug LED — nothing. I thought the motherboard was dead.   However, when I removed the AIO head and tried to boot again, it worked!  Since then, I’ve been experiencing intermittent no-POST issues, especially after gaming sessions.   To get it to boot, I always have to adjust the screws on the AIO head. If it’s too tight: no POST. If it’s too loose: CPU temperatures are high. For example, in Hogwarts Legacy, I get around 60 FPS with an RTX 4090, while the CPU runs at around 18% usage @ 85°C. Which is not normal at all, as I used to run the game at around 100–110 FPS.  I tightened the screws on the contact frame using my thumb and index fingers.   I’m looking for advice from anyone who has encountered a similar issue, because at this point my only idea is to remove the contact frame and reinstall the original one.  For context, my setup is from November 2022, and I installed the contact frame in August 2025. I have never removed the CPU from the socket since the first installation.  Thank you all.",Negative

AMD,"Intel ARC b580 apparently unable to run games in the snowdrop engine, but in such a way that it's almost impossible for benchmarkers/testers to catch.  I've been trying to run Avatar Frontiers of Pandora on my arc b580 for over a year now, and I keep having the same extremely unusual crash.  If I freshly reinstall the game, or change my operating system, or switch arc driver version, I can play the game normally, at regular framerates, with no issues, for around an hour. MAYBE two if I'm lucky.   The game then crashes, with seemingly no trigger. No thermal issues, no unusual resource usage, no memory leak, no framerate issues, no stuttering, not even a crash report. The game will just close as if I had closed it manually.   I don't crash in the same location every time, it crashes with different game settings, xess enabled/disabled, different monitors, different ram configurations. I can have the framerate capped or uncapped. GPU maxed out or not, power draw high or low. I can't consistently recreate the crash in the same way every time. The only certainty is that it WILL crash eventually.  After crashing once, It will then crash on game launch, every single time. The game opens, the epilepsy warning flashes up for a second or two, and then the game crashes in the same way, with no freeze, no crash report, just the game closing.  Since the game runs fine for an hour or so after I first install it, any benchmarker testing the gpu will likely never see the crash, because they install the game, run benchmarks, do their tests, and then close it before seeing anything wrong.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and have NOT worked.  * Updating graphics drivers (to both the latest absolute driver, and latest WHQL certified driver). * Downgrading graphics drivers (going all the way back to the first game ready drivers for the b580). * Updating windows (latest windows 10 and latest windows 11 versions). * Running a memory diagnostic * Enabling/disabling XMP. * Verifying integrity of game files. * Forcing the game to run in the Vulkan engine instead of snowdrop. * Performing a complete reinstall of the game. * Replacing one of the .dll files with a ""repaired"" one. (this apparently fixed a crash for some people). * Forcing the game to boot in dx11 instead of dx12.  The following are fixes that I have tried, and HAVE worked.  * Running the game on my AMD integrated graphics.  Obviously running the game on an igpu doesn't offer playable performance, but the game will run, and I've yet to find any crash, even leaving the game open for several hours.  Due to this issue, I'm on the verge of selling my b580 and replacing it with a different card from another manufacturer that hopefully won't have the same issue.

The freezes occur during gaming, mixed workloads (gaming + video playback), remote desktop usage (TeamViewer), and occasionally shortly after logging into Windows with no workload running.  When my PC hard freezes:  \- Mouse is unresponsive  \- Keyboard is unresponsive  \- No audio sound  \- No BSOD or error message     My PC does not recover and requires a manual power button reboot.  After a forced reboot, Windows loads normally and allows me to log in but the system may freeze again within 1–2 minutes, even at idle. Other times, the system may run normally for days before the issue reappears.  No relevant error logs are generated at the time of the freezes. Event Viewer only shows Kernel Power events related to the forced shutdown.  So far I've tried all possible solutions to resolve my issue:  \- Updated motherboard BIOS to the latest available version  \- Updated Windows 11 fully and also reinstalled Windows 11 through USB  \- Performed clean GPU driver reinstallations  \- Verified CPU and GPU temperatures (normal under load)  \- Ran hardware stress tests and diagnostics (CPU, GPU, memory, storage) and no failures detected  \- Tested each monitor individually (dual monitor setup)  \- Swapped HDMI/DisplayPort cables and ports  \- Tested my PC without background applications  \- Returned my PC to stock settings (no overclocks, no undervolts, no XMP changes beyond default)  I've also took my pc to a local repair shop, which they could not reproduce the issue but suggested it may be CPU or PSU related issue.

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets). It's more comprehensive than just running the uninstaller, but it should give you that permanent solution you're looking for.",Neutral

Installing a contact frame changes the pressure distribution compared to the stock retention mechanism, so overtightening the AIO screws can amplify this issue. On the other hand, if the screws are too loose, the CPU temperatures will rise because the cooler is not making proper thermal contact. To avoid these problems, ensure the AIO screws are tightened evenly in a cross pattern and do not exceed the manufacturer’s torque specifications.

AMD,"u/Any_Information429 Your HP EliteBook 830 G8 is experiencing boot issues due to corrupted Intel Management Engine (ME) firmware, which is a critical low-level system component that manages hardware initialization. This corruption is causing the blinking caps lock light, multiple restart attempts before successful boot, and the extended Windows startup times you've been experiencing. The BIOS showing ""ME Firmware Mode: Recovery Mode"" confirms this diagnosis. Since these issues began after your recent repair, it's likely that the Management Engine chip connections were disturbed or the firmware became corrupted during the service process.  To resolve this, you need to perform a forced recovery of the ME firmware by downloading the specific firmware version for your EliteBook model from HP's support website-[HP EliteBook 830 G8 Notebook PC Software and Driver Downloads | HP® Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/hp-elitebook-830-g8-notebook-pc/38216726) and using specialized recovery tools to reflash the Management Engine. You also have check BIOS settings to ensure proper ME configuration and temporarily disable fast boot to allow complete initialization. If the firmware recovery doesn't resolve the issue, this may indicate hardware-level damage to the ME controller that occurred during the previous repair, which would require professional chip-level service or potentially warranty coverage since the problem originated after authorized service work. The good news is that once the ME firmware is properly restored, your system should return to normal boot times and eliminate the restart cycles you're currently experiencing.

I'd suggest running a memory test first (just search for ""Windows Memory Diagnostic"" in your start menu), and if you have any virtual machines or Docker running, try shutting those down temporarily, we'll probably need to dig deeper into hardware or system-level issues to really fix this one.",Negative
AMD,"u/strumpystrudel So what you're experiencing is actually pretty normal behavior for your laptop when it's unplugged - that 80% performance drop is totally expected and here's why. When your laptop is plugged into the wall, your CPU can run at much higher power levels (probably around 28W or more), but when you switch to battery, it gets severely limited to maybe 8-15W to preserve battery life. This is especially true for ultrabooks like the Gram that prioritize being thin and light over raw performance. The thing is, a lot of this power management happens at the hardware level with Intel's built-in systems, which is why all those Windows power settings you tweaked aren't really making a difference - the CPU is basically ignoring them and doing its own thing to save battery.  Now, for a game like Final Fantasy XI, you should still be able to get it running decently on battery with some tweaks, but expecting that same smooth 60 FPS at max settings is probably unrealistic given the fundamental power constraints of ultrabook design. Most ultrabooks see this kind of 60-80% performance hit on battery for any sustained workload, so you're definitely not alone in this.   But honestly, this is just how these thin and light laptops are designed to work - they're amazing when plugged in, but they have to make compromises when running on battery to actually give you decent battery life.",Neutral
AMD,"u/Aggravating_Gap_203 I'd recommend running Intel's Processor Diagnostic Tool first to rule out any hardware defects with the CPU itself. Just download it from Intel's website, run the test, and let us know if it passes or fails. While you're at it, try loading your BIOS defaults and make sure your power settings are at Intel's recommended specs - PL1 should be around 125W and PL2 around 181W for your 14600KF-[Intel® Core™ i5 processor 14600KF](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236778/intel-core-i5-processor-14600kf-24m-cache-up-to-5-30-ghz/specifications.html)  [Intel® Processor Diagnostic Tool](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15951/intel-processor-diagnostic-tool.html)  Your friend is actually spot on about the contact frame recommendation. Before you buy one though, try remounting your cooler one more time - make sure you're tightening the screws in an X-pattern and that everything is perfectly aligned. Sometimes it just takes that perfect mount to get things working right. Let us know what the Intel diagnostic shows and we can go from there!",Neutral

AMD,"u/Sk7Str1p3 I'm pleased to confirm that TME is indeed supported on your i7-12700F processor. TME is a security feature that encrypts the entire system memory using AES encryption with a hardware-generated key. The i7-12700F is part of Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake family, which includes TME support as a standard security feature.  However, TME functionality requires both processor support and proper system configuration:  Verification methods:  * BIOS/UEFI security settings * System diagnostic tools that enumerate processor security features  Important considerations: TME enablement depends on the motherboard BIOS implementation and may be disabled by default on many systems.  To assist you further, I need the following information:  * Make and model of your motherboard, as the TME feature may be disabled in the BIOS settings  For your reference, please find the official documentation: 12th Generation Intel® Core™ Processors Datasheet, Volume 1 of 2  [655258](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/655258) (Page 40) - This document contains the specific technical details about TME support for your processor.

AMD,"Your Intel i7-12700F processor does support TME (Total Memory Encryption), but the issue lies with your motherboard implementation rather than CPU capability. The ASRock H670M Pro RS with firmware 18.01 appears to either disable TME at the platform level or doesn't expose the necessary BIOS controls for consumer users. This explains why your diagnostic tools show ""TME = false"" and why HWiNFO64 displays it in gray. While you could check for TME-related options in your BIOS under Advanced → CPU Configuration or Security sections, consumer-grade H670 motherboards often omit these enterprise security features from their interfaces. Your best course of action is to contact ASRock technical support directly, providing your exact motherboard model, BIOS version, and specifically asking about TME support and whether future firmware updates might include these controls.",Neutral
AMD,"Most commenters are wrong or didn’t read all the articles. Nvidia wants some custom SKUs of server chips to pair with its data center GPUs, and Intel wanted a better solution for pc parts for the GPU tiles.   NVIDIA is NOT getting an x86 license, nor do they want one. In case you haven’t noticed, Nvidia is a $4T company largely on sales of data center GPUs, sales of which were 10x the gaming segment. Profit/earnings ratio of data center is even higher than the 10x.   In my opinion, the only reason for Intel to use RTX chiplets on pc parts is so they can have a few skus for mobile gaming. Lower end laptop chips would still use Xe cores.  This solves NONE of intel’s structural issues - they need, in this order  1. Major foundry customers  2. Regain server market share 3.

AMD,"The last time NVIDIA made onboard graphics for a PC, they could hardly be considered graphics.

You were much better off getting ATi onboard graphics back then inside of an FX or AMD Bullerdozer chip.  In more recent times, this also applies to laptops with the low end MX chips. Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative
AMD,A310 is cheap enough and good enough for it's purpose. If it ain't broke why fix it,Neutral
AMD,"Wrong man. You just don’t understand how small the diypc market is compared to prebuilts, laptops, and enterprise- it’s a fraction of one percent.",Negative
AMD,The later versions of Dlss 2 look like Dlss 3,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia probably feels the same about their low end SKUs.,Neutral
AMD,"The DIYPC market largely drives the “prebuilt” market, with a 1-3 generation lag.  Many people who buy “prebuilts” have people they go to for advice (i.e. they talk to their friends/family members who DIY). When there’s a big swing in the DIY market, it typically ripples out to the prebuilt market over a few years/generations.",Neutral
AMD,"Lol, what an explanation hahahaha   And that's still not ""better than DLSS 3"" as most say",Negative
AMD,Yeah lol,Positive
AMD,AMD Unboxed say anything about that? What about Linus Cheap Tips!,Neutral
AMD,"""Everyone I don't like is biased""-ass answer",Negative
