Intel,SR-IOV at that price. Who cares about anything else.,Neutral
Intel,Intel would be stupid to axe there Graphic card division if this proves to be successful.,Negative
Intel,"Single-slot variant or custom cooler please, my MS-A2 running proxmox is demanding this card.",Neutral
Intel,About 66% overall performance of a B580 it looks like. That's really nice for a 70W card.,Positive
Intel,"This is exciting, definitely looking forward to the b60 as well.",Positive
Intel,"Obligatory ""Intel is exiting the GPU business any moment now"".",Neutral
Intel,how hard are tehse to actually buy?,Neutral
Intel,"Buying one, this is impressive",Positive
Intel,Its better than a 1.5 year old bottom of the range card....well done i guess.,Positive
Intel,Better than NVIDIA? lol .... oooookay,Positive
Intel,"Haven't seen the video, but I'm already buying one if that's the case",Neutral
Intel,Literally it could be a damn arc a310 or rx6400 and people would buy that card at $350 without licencing bs. For anything VDI related the B50 is huge.,Negative
Intel,Intel’s “MOAAAAAR CORES” in the GPU space???,Neutral
Intel,what is that? SR-IOV?,Neutral
Intel,Super interesting!  Wonder how well it would handle AI tasks like Frigate while another VM uses it for inference or a third doing video transcoding with Plex.,Positive
Intel,16 GB VRAM too,Neutral
Intel,They will eventually axe it.,Neutral
Intel,Instead of axing it maybe spin it off like AMD did with Global Foundries?,Neutral
Intel,And if it isn’t successful?,Neutral
Intel,They do have 3rd party vendors for ARC PRO Cards this time around so it most likely will happen.,Neutral
Intel,"The B60 is more exciting to me just for that 24GB VRAM. Still, at this price point the B50 is a pretty compelling buy tbh.",Positive
Intel,I think it would be really stupid for them to do so.,Negative
Intel,You can preorder from newegg now. They ship later this month.,Neutral
Intel,"One Swedish retailer I checked has them coming into stock next week (10 September) and open to orders, how much stock there will be however, I have no clue.",Neutral
Intel,Same. I put my preorder in. Plan to put it into one of my sff builds.,Neutral
Intel,What did bottom of the range cards cost 1.5 years ago?  How much VRAM did they have?  Did they support SR-IOV?   Just think for a bit sometimes.,Neutral
Intel,It quite literally is. Watch the fucking video.,Negative
Intel,"Wendell confirmed as much in the comments, looking forward to his future testing of the card.",Positive
Intel,What does AMD have in this product segment?,Neutral
Intel,"I didn't know either so I looked it up.   ""SR-IOV (Single Root Input/Output Virtualization) is a PCI Express technology that allows a single physical device to appear as multiple separate virtual devices, significantly improving I/O performance in virtualized environments by giving virtual machines direct access to hardware. This bypasses the overhead of a software-based virtual switch, resulting in lower latency and higher throughput for demanding applications by dedicating virtual functions (VFs) to guest VMs.""",Neutral
Intel,Everyone (including Nvidia) is moving toward APUs with large GPUs onboard. Why would Intel kill their chance at competing in that market?  They've already withstood the most painful part of the transition. There's no point in stopping now.,Neutral
Intel,They are keeping their Fabs which is even more expensive to maintain why would they sell GPU not to mention their iGPUs are pretty Damm good nowdays not like meme in Intel HD4400 even though they could play any game /jk.,Negative
Intel,Doubt they have the revenue to spin out successfully without significant investment from outside sources.,Negative
Intel,Sadly Intel has a recent history of making poor life choices.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe it's just me, but this reads as AI generated.",Neutral
Intel,"I dunno man, I was building a PC for work and the 3050 was the cheapest Nvidia card I can get and the 7600 is the cheapest from AMD. Huge price gap between the two, by about 100 USD. AMD really needs to buck up their APUs to render cheap GPUs surplus or have something cheaper than a 7600 to price match the 3050.",Neutral
Intel,"They're comparing it to an entry-level NVIDIA GPU, the A1000. Saying that Intel GPUs are ""better than NVIDIA"" as a universal statement is flat-out wrong. Let's see some competition to the RTX 5070 Ti, 5080, or 5090. NVIDIA has zero competition on mid-range and high-end GPUs.",Negative
Intel,Radeon Pro V710 and you can't even buy it retail.,Neutral
Intel,thanks 🙏,Positive
Intel,Because intel shareholders are super short sighted.,Neutral
Intel,this comment is the weirdest version of 'corporations are people' that i've encountered,Negative
Intel,Lmao seriously the formatting and the amount of bolded words just screams AI,Negative
Intel,It's AI generated in your mind,Neutral
Intel,"because AMD has a bad habit of leaving a bunch of their older cards in the channel and having them become the low end...  CPU and GPU, AM4 lives for so long because there are still piles of the stuff in the channel and just gets slow tiny discounts till its gone in full  its like their demand forecast is too optimistic or something but at this point I think its deliberate",Negative
Intel,Because this is not a gaming GPU and thus the A1000 is the correct card to compare with.,Neutral
Intel,Good luck using those super gpus to host multiple gpu accelerated vm with one card. Nvidia won't let you.,Positive
Intel,"Yes, compare an Arc Pro to a GeForce, totally the same market.",Neutral
Intel,"That seems more mid or high tier rather than these relatively low tier gpus, the b50 is a cut down b580...  Also the v710 seems like the kind of ""passive"" gpu that's ""passive"" as long as it's next to several 7,000 rpm fans.  So it would probably not work very well as a retail car because it's rack server focused.",Negative
Intel,"I think the really loud short sighted shareholders have quieted down a bit after it became clear they helped drive the company to where they are. Hell, they're probably not even shareholders anymore.",Negative
Intel,The weirdest version was Citizens United,Neutral
Intel,Did you not figure out why they’re bolded?,Neutral
Intel,I'm aware but it's the only current gen GPU for graphics workloads that has virtualization support from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"The current Chairman of the board, Frank Yeary, is one of these stupid short sighted people. He REALLY wants to sell the fabs, and is probably the reason Intel went through their latest round of layoffs (Lip-Bu Tan wanted to raise money from Wall Street, Yeary apparently sabotaged it).",Negative
Intel,"if corps are people, they should be allowed to vote, right ?",Neutral
Intel,"Not only that, but because they are people, they should also be able to fund gigantic super PACS to get a candidate into office. I love America!",Positive
Intel,"u/michaellarabel It would be super cool to have Molecular Dynamics benchmarks for these kind of cards, since you already use them for CPU testing and a few of them (e.g. GROMACS) support APIs from all three vendors (CUDA, ROCm, SyCL, + OpenCL)",Positive
Intel,"Same price as B580 with lower performance, 4GB less vram and 128 bit bus.  A round of applause for Nvidia",Neutral
Intel,"GB207 being slower than AD107 is pathetic, what's the point of these x07 dies again? They're not thst mich smaller than recent x06 dies.  They're spaffing design cost on these barely different dues.",Negative
Intel,"Now that we have a third-party review, it pretty much confirms what Inno3D said the other day, it's definitively slower than the RTX 4060 by about 5-7%.",Neutral
Intel,The RTX 5050 is 2.5% slower than the Arc B580.   It's also a 50 series card that costs $250.,Neutral
Intel,> the system used a Ryzen 7 9800X3D  If the B580 only wins by 2.6% with this CPU then it's going to lose when you use something weaker because of that CPU overhead problem with Intel.,Negative
Intel,It's actually surprising that it's that close to a 4060 considering the 5050 only has 2 GPCs as opposed to the 4060's 3,Neutral
Intel,IDK but that performance is actually not bad. It should've just been cheaper.,Negative
Intel,The only positive about this is they're likely going to make a 5040 with a cut down chip that should pretty easily fit <75W.,Positive
Intel,"Honestly for people who don't need a lot of GPU power, not the worse.   I have two work computers, one with a 4090 and an old one with a 3090Ti.  These GPUs sit idle just taking up space, would have made more sense to get the something less performant.",Negative
Intel,272mm\^2 for B580 vs \~150 or less for RTX 5050 and perf within 5% lmao,Neutral
Intel,"I think to lose in sales, it would have had to lose a little more convincingly.  Yes, it's worse. But not enough to make up for features and brand-loyalty / nvidias massive reputation with gamers who are not into tech.  This thing will sell. It will sell A LOT. Because Average-Kevin who just wants to play Fortnite and some League will have a great time with it. His YT videos will get upscaling, his shitty mic-quality will get fixed (mostly) by Nvidia Broadcast... and he DGAF why we think it's the wrong move.",Negative
Intel,"Does it actually fall behind the b580 or is it due to vram bottleneck in certain instances?  Either way, this should open up people’s eyes about the b580. The b580 is just marginally above the 5050, which is a terrible product, with 4gb more vram… even at its 250 dollar price point, it’s never been a good deal. Not to mention how it’s going for 400 these days.",Negative
Intel,"People who own 9800X3D's aren't buying B580's or RTX 5050's, i'd wait for more realistic reviews using CPU's people actually own.  Edit: r/hardware is dumb CPU overhead is a thing and budget GPU buyers need to know which of these two cards is effected the most by it. Everyone already knows that you are going to be GPU limited on top tier CPU's its not valuable information for a budget card.",Negative
Intel,Looks like people already forgot that testing the B580 with a top end CPU gives unrealistic results for actual budget buyers.  Every trick in the book for a nvidia sucks article.,Negative
Intel,Don’t make Jensen sad,Neutral

Intel,the 3060 is still a better value than this card bc its about same speed but 12gb vram and higher bus,Positive
Intel,"Maybe a product for non-gamers who want/need multiple display setup, like me. Even then, if you bother to spend that amount of money for 5050, better add some more to get 5060, and if bother to get 5060 just better get 16GB one. Furthermore, you may feel why not add bit more to get 5070 series rather than 5060 16GB. That's how these things are priced.",Neutral
Intel,Value engineering to extract as much wealth as possible while unable to match performance conditions.,Neutral
Intel,When you gimp the memory bus of course it is not as good,Neutral
Intel,"No 75 watt gpu, pin connectior, yeah this is death of arrival.",Negative
Intel,"Trying to convince people to buy a 8gb card in 2025 should be illegal. Yet, people will line up to buy it because of the Nvidia logo...",Negative
Intel,"It's a Nvidia Rx 7600, actually good recommendation over that card if it released for the same price in India. Rx 7600 is awful compared to rtx 5050 in pretty much everything.",Positive
Intel,Humiliation for the RTX 5050 is well deserved. It's good this gets curb stomped by the Intel B580.  More market share for Intel because AMD also introduced a useless 8 GB card.,Positive
Intel,">128 bit bus  Seems like this isn't the main issue with 5050's performance. 4060 has lowest memory bandwidth out of all 3, yet it's the fastest card. The die is just too cut down.",Negative
Intel,Unfortunately it will still sell like hotcakes in pre-builts to people who don't know much about computers.,Negative
Intel,"Their brand name is so strong that despite being worse in basically every way, including having poor drivers which was one of their major selling points in the past, they will still sell super well",Positive
Intel,"I just looked at PCPartPicker and the cheapest B580 on there, in the US, is $299 (and the brand is Onix). The Intel Limited Edition is $340. If you can get the 5050 at MSRP it would have a decent price advantage.  I mean, I wouldn't get a 5050 but in the US at least, the $249 price for the B580 isn't real.",Neutral
Intel,"Where I live none of the main sellers stock the B580, a round of applause for Intel.  The B580 isn't faster on the CPU's owned by the people who are in the market of a budget GPU.  People who own 9800X3D's aren't buying B580's or RTX 5050's, i'd wait for more realistic reviews using CPU's people actually own.",Negative
Intel,Intel apparently hasn't shipped any GPUs last quarter. The shortage is already been seen as prices of b580 are going up.,Negative
Intel,They're really pushing what they can get away with these days. Less VRAM and narrower bus but want the same money... bold strategy.,Neutral
Intel,"> with lower performance,  even on lower end cpu? Holy crap nvidia wtf",Negative
Intel,Because it will sell a shit load. Probably will be one of the highest selling Nvidia GPUs this generation,Negative
Intel,"At these small die sizes, yields can be really high. High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die. There will be some with only 18, or 16, or even fewer working SMs. Hell it could lose an entire GPC and be down to half-working. Those will be some absolutely sad little GPUs.",Neutral
Intel,> It's also a 50 series card that costs $250.  I'll believe that when I see it in stock for 250. MSRP is meaningless if the product isn't available for that price.,Neutral
Intel,And will be even worse since it's vram is 8gb. In many many games the b580 would Perform even better,Negative
Intel,Yeah it would be interesting to test with a more real-world CPU pairing.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, that was my question, did that ever get fixed? It seems like nobody remembers that anymore",Negative
Intel,"TBH, they should have made THIS card a 75W SKU. It probably easily can be, without losing much performance. That would make it a very viable upgrade path for low-end systems. And kind of make the price more attractive, because it would require zero additional changes.",Positive
Intel,Margins go crazy,Neutral
Intel,4x the performance with MFG though.,Neutral
Intel,In mkst cases comparison would make sense since you testing gpu's not anything else. But when you toss in b580 complaints about using too powerfull cpu make much more sense,Neutral
Intel,I have a system with a 9950x3d and a 1060. I’m thinking of getting a 5050 to go with it.,Neutral
Intel,> Every trick in the book for a nvidia sucks article.  That's just a standardised testing suite.   Someone will have low-end CPU testing once this gets any distribution.,Negative
Intel,They're using the same cpu for the 5050 too. What a weird comment to make.,Negative
Intel,"Don’t forget how everyone is shitting on the 5050, calling it the worst nvidia card ever, but were praising intel non stop for the b580.  Even using purely stats from the article, b580 is 3% better with 4gb more VRAM than “worst gpu ever”, so I don’t see how this translates to a win for the b580. Being better than a terrible product by a hair doesn’t exactly make it good.",Negative
Intel,Same can be said for the 5050 no? Both have CPU overheads unlike AMD which any mid-range AMD GPU can easily outperform Nvidia's 5090 at 1080p.   The 12GB VRAM however are better suited for people who are stuck at older Gen3/Gen4 PCIE speeds.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll run nearly every game in existence at 1080p with playable framerates with the right settings. IDK why it would be a product for non-gamers. Calling it that means the B580, 4060 and 7600 are products for non-gamers, too.  Only game I could think of it wouldn't run properly would be oblivion remastered, which has terrible performance on anything.",Negative
Intel,3050 released with the exact same specs and msrp. The 70w variant only came out 2 years after. The first variant was in top 10 of steam's hardware chart.,Neutral
Intel,"This is not a card for 1440p, as it would have issues with getting even 60 fps there, and in 1080p 8gb is mostly enough.  There is a difference between choking on VRAM with 80 base fps (5060ti) and 50 base fps (5050). Yes, second case is still annoying, but you might want to dial down the settings anyway, and then you would be fine.",Negative
Intel,Nvidia RX7600? That a new GPU? 😂,Neutral
Intel,"Funnily enough the 8gb 9060 XT is the best brand-new alternative at $300 and below, hands-down, and that includes the B580. It's x16 interface means it's less restricted by the vram compared to the 5060/Ti 8gb. The B580 still has overhead issues, VR issues, game issues and is rarely available at MSRP.  But people trash it anyway and praise the B580 without actually looking at its performance. In the benchmark linked by the OP alone it loses to the 4060 lol",Positive
Intel,"Performance is fine I'm sure it'll perform just as good as the 3060 maybe slightly if you lower the power to 75W, call it a 5030 and sell it for $150. But these are different times and Nvidia doesn't do reasonable things like that anymore.  Bottom line, it's just the price and TDP that sucks.",Neutral
Intel,TBF a pre-built you're just looking at:   * What's the price?  * Does it have a graphics card or not?  * Overall package/size,Neutral
Intel,"or even people who have a baseline knowledge, but think ""dlss and framegen"" will make this abomination better than its competition",Negative
Intel,"It's not so much the brand name but their near monopoly in the prebuilt market. There will be 1 prebuilt with a 9060XT 8 or 16GB for every 20 prebuilts with a 5050/5060. It's so bad that even the prebuilts with the 16GB 9060XT will be outsold by prebuilts with a 5050 at the same price range, as companies like to pair trash GPUs with ""high"" end CPUs like a 13700F to clear stock but the ""i7"" allows them to mark up the price.",Negative
Intel,"It was in stock at newegg monday for 3+ hours at $249.99, I picked one up after seeing a post that was 3 hours old on /r/buildapcsales   I've stopped into microcenter a couple of times and they said they get them, but I just haven't been lucky enough to be there when they were restocked.

Intel,Her in Canada they are $360 CAD. Cheap cheap. And ways to find. Might be a issue in your country perhaps,Neutral
Intel,"Went on Shopee and the lowest I could find is $280, which is not bad considering there's usually taxes which increases prices of GPUs by 10-20% from global USD MSRP.",Neutral

Intel,Not in Canada. Prices are exactly as launch. Could be your countries problem,Negative
Intel,"Eh, they recently shipped a new batch at MSRP to Newegg.  Don’t know what’s going on with the partner cards. Probably the typical shenanigans",Neutral
Intel,You forgot about the smaller dies.,Neutral
Intel,"The chip is tiny, so a single wafer -> more chips. The demands on power delivery, cooling etc. are nothing to speak of. And the GDDR6 memory is cheap and readily available.  If anything will ever be in stock, it's this card.",Positive
Intel,5060 has been in stock at MSRP everyday since launch. This should be the same. Even the 5060ti 8gb and 5070 are at MSRP.,Neutral
Intel,MSRP has always been meaningless because it stand for suggested retail price.,Neutral
Intel,"But if the recent LTT video is halfway accurate, AMD would murder both of them in that scenario. The 9060 XT 8GB might want to have a word with those two cards.",Neutral
Intel,negative margins for intel,Neutral
Intel,The B580 showed we need to test in the systems the cards will end up being used in. The restricted PCIe lines on the lower tier cards i.e. only use 8 also means they need to be tested on older systems.,Neutral
Intel,You really believe you are an average 9950x3D owner? Really?,Negative
Intel,"Out of curiosity, what is your use case in such a setup? I find myself cpu bottlenecked quite often on a 7800x3D but i use a 4070S, when i used 1070 GPU was bottlenecking me.",Neutral
Intel,"But Intel Arc drivers have a really bad overhead, while nvidia does not, so in gpu bound games the 5050 will have around the same performance but the b580 will lose a lot of it, so it's not a weird comment, it's a very important point.",Negative
Intel,>in 1080p 8gb is mostly enough.  The narrative was pushed so much that this fact became an unpopular opinion.,Negative
Intel,nvidia Rx 7600 equivalent or Rx 7600 alternative by nvidia. Ig people can't even get a silly joke nowadays,Negative
Intel,The 12 GB of RAM in the B580 will age more gracefully for a truly low end gamers. On purpose of 8 gb is retro gaming.,Neutral
Intel,"Hate to be that guy but to call this a 30-class card is insane. The 1030 was 25% the performance of the 1060, and the 1630 was around 45% the performance of the 1660. This card is 80% the performance of a 5060, which should probably be called the 5050.  To take it a step further, the GT 1030 was 13% of the 1080ti, the 5050 is 20% of the 5090. The 1050 was 25% of the 1080ti, so it would be reasonable to call this a 5040 or I could even be satisfied with 5040ti.",Neutral
Intel,That would be an interesting card,Positive
Intel,I think a big thing about prebuilts are the aesthetics. Does it look good? is the cables managed? Is the RGB controllable?  Slapping a PC together is easy but building something that looks beautiful through the side panel is not as easy.,Neutral
Intel,The 4060 is 2% and DLSS did plenty of work for the even slower 3060. DLSS is going to be great for this card. Frame gen will be good in games this card can run at good base framerates.,Positive
Intel,"cool, it's in stock now",Positive
Intel,A 2-year old CPU ushering a new platform at the time of B580's launch. Far from a budget user's upgrade timeline-wise.,Neutral
Intel,"For a brand-new truly budget build, AM5 is still restrictive pricewise to people eyeing GPUs of this level. The 3050 and 6600 were well-known inclusions in $500 builds, building with a 7500F is going to cost $280-300 just for the cpu, mb and ram alone. AM4 or LGA1700 otoh can be as low as $180-200.",Neutral
Intel,Depends on the game  The 7600 can see some serious performance deficits in some games like Spider Man  https://youtu.be/00GmwHIJuJY&t=521  and Hogwarts' minimum FPS is affected  https://youtu.be/00GmwHIJuJY&t=468,Negative

Intel,I never said I was,Neutral
Intel,"I'm looking into this now, and you are correct. I am just reading this for the first time.",Neutral
Intel,Lol no. For truly low-end gamers the B580 will perform worse because of its CPU overhead that still hasn't been fixed more than half a year after release.,Negative
Intel,"I mean not really. The b580 is low end enough to the point where it'll become obsolete in performance long before it runs out of VRAM.  It's the equivalent of saying buying a 16gb 7600xt in 2025 is ""more futureproof"" than buying a 12gb 3060 in 2025.",Negative
Intel,an 8 GB card is obsolete at day one for modern games.,Neutral
Intel,"It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup. You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral
Intel,Nah most people who buy prebuilts just want a good working PC with minimum effort,Negative
Intel,Yep. That's a problem for that country. Countries with normal leadership have much more viable options,Negative
Intel,Price is only driven by demand and supply. See how the crazy expensive GPU still sell like a hot cake during the COVID lockdown period?,Neutral
Intel,It's well known by Arc owners.,Neutral
Intel,"The 16gb 7600xt  is a giant pile of crap even with 16 GB , so a 12 GB 3060 is the better choice.  If you go to techpowerup you'll see that the b580 is 17% in relative performance than the ""12 GB 3060 """,Negative
Intel,What if you’re playing at 720p?,Neutral
Intel,"> It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup.  That is a absolute dog shit methodology to use.   The 1080 Ti was 471 mm², 5090 is 750 mm².  Those two products are not the same tier. And can therefor not be used as equal reference points. When it comes to die size the top Pascal card is closer to the 5080 than 5090.",Negative
Intel,The point is more VRAM =/= aging better. The b580 having 12gb isn't saving it from becoming obsolete in a few years.,Negative
Intel,"They re not the same price tier either bro... They could have called the 5090 a 5095ti if that makes you happier.  The guy you quoted is right.   Also comparing the performance diff between the 1030 vs 1060 because guess what the 5060 should have been the 5050 looking at die size and memory bus.   Not sure why people keep defending these naming schemes, do you think the engineers use them internally lol? Its bullshit that marketing comes up with",Negative
Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters. How large the top die is and what core configuration it has. Is irrelevant for the value for cards further down the stack.",Neutral

Intel,Only 2 words  Fuck Nvidia!,Negative
Intel,Can you buy a single one or do you have to buy it in Battlematrix form like the other B60?,Neutral
Intel,"Finally something for modern day workstations. If you are working on a desktop these days, the most important thing is access to AI models.   With these, you can easily buy 2-4 B60s and throw them in your machine to not be reliant on external services all the time. Could be a real productivity booster.",Positive

Intel,Dual gpu. 2012 amd...is that you?,Neutral
Intel,"Hey, dumb question: can a motherboard with 4 pcie slot runs 4 of this card?  That would make 48\*4=192gb, pretty doable for really large langu model.",Neutral
Intel,I remember when he said that Intel were scumbags  did he change his mind?,Neutral
Intel,Don’t get fooled by 48GB. The card actually behaves as 2 cards of 24GB with pcie x8 lanes each of gen 5.0 in bifurcation mode. So for gaming most likely you will be getting only 24GB of vram (which is still not bad). But this card really shines in AI or other professional loads because they are claiming that you can have one big shared memory across multiple cards with their drivers and without any physical connectors like crossfire or sli. This means you can run full fat deepseek completely locally on your physical system with something like 4 of B60 on a threadripper system. God damm never even imagined that intel would be shining in GPU segment.,Neutral
Intel,this technology is from ASUS Mars II 3 GB Dual GTX 580 maybe from 14 years ago?,Neutral
Intel,they wont sell these discretely [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Oq5NTR6Sk),Neutral
Intel,no software support + half of the memory bandwidth of the 5 year old 3090,Negative
Intel,"Sli never left... Nvidia just hide it away from customers and sell it as nvlink (with some upgrades) for high end component for commercial side because they didn't want people stacking their cheaper cards.    Edit: got it, seems like I misunderstood what Sli does with the vram as it didn't pool.",Neutral
Intel,Unfortunately this is just a way to get more GPUs into one system. There’s nothing like SLI.,Negative
Intel,No need for SLI to use multiple GPUs.,Neutral
Intel,"no this particular card does not support sli. this is just to increase the gpu density in a given system. Increased from 1 gpu per slot to 2 gpus per slot.   According to linux tech tips, the memory sharing between cards are done on the software level, which in my opinion is not a good thing. the pci-e gen5 x8 bus has a memory bandwith of 32GB/s in one direction (latest nvlink support up to 900GB in one direction). More inter-card bandwidth = better performance on large models (assuming the model support multi-gpu setup). No dedicated inter-card interface certainly will harm the maximum theoratical performance in certain workloads.",Neutral
Intel,"Me too. Based on the TOPS, the inference speed seems to be roughly comparably to a 3060TI for the B60 and the Dual being roughly comparable to a 4080, though i think realistically more like a 3080/4060 due to the bandwiths. I've run a good bit of local inference on a 3060 12GB, and while it isn't hyper-performant, the speed is slower but ""acceptably slow"" in my opinion. You won't be waiting 10 seconds per token, but it's also not going to be spitting out a novel per minute. For me, that extra memory is really what matters because it mean less quantization at roughly the same speeds I'm used to, which means less errors in the output. I'm really more hopeful that this will finally light a fire under the NVIDIA execs who thought punishing consumers with less memory to prevent corporate customers/datacenters from using consumer cards in their servers was the right move. You can see they are reversing that somewhat with the 5090, but they can kick rocks with that 3k\* price tag that is once-again intended to get more money from data centers who decide to try to use them. It's pure market manipulation and artificial deflation of the specs to drive pro customers to more expensive hardware at consumer's burden.",Neutral
Intel,"Tokens/second won't be as good as a high end Nvidia card obviously, but you'll be able to fit a much larger model onto it than you could for any consumer and almost any Nvidia card. And for $1000, you could run four of these and still come out way cheaper than one A6000.",Positive
Intel,"Since I've run a bunch of tests on Xe2 (and of course plenty of Nvidia and AMD chips):  * A 70B Q4 dense model is about 40GB. w/ f16 kvcache, You should expect to fit 16-20K of context (depends on tokenizer, overhead etc) w/ 48GB of VRAM. * B60 has 456GB/s of MBW. At 80% (this would be excellent) MBW efficiency, you'd expect a maximum of 9 tok/s for token generation (a little less than 7 words/s. Avg reading speed is 5 words/s, just as a point of reference most models from commercial providers output at 100 tok/s+ * For processing, based on CU count each B60 die should have about ~~30~~ 100 FP16 TFLOPS (double FP8/INT8) but it's tough to say exactly how it'd perform for inference (for layer splitting you usually don't get a benefit - you could do tensor spliting, but you might lose perf if you hit bus bottlenecks). I wouldn't bet on it processing a 70B model faster than 200 tok/s though (fine for short context, but slower as it gets longer.  Like for Strix Halo, I think it'd do best for MoE's but there's not much at the 30GB or so size (if you have 2X, I'd Llama 4 Scout Q4 (58GB) might be interesting once there are better tuned versions.",Neutral

Intel,OpenVINO is fully supported on Arc discrete graphics and supports both Windows and Linux.,Neutral
Intel,"Man you don't know what are even talking about, these GPUs are one 192 bits per unit combined you will get 384 bit through 2 GPUs and the 3090 well it's half the amount of VRAM and it is powerful but in workstation use it is not the only thing you need, and software support, there is not support for 50 Series cards on many applications like premiere, Da Vinci and most of the work based applications and the Game ready drivers are more than capable enough to run LLMs on Windows and Linux",Negative
Intel,"Tbh that is probably for the best. Sli was never that great for gaming, all that leaving sli open as an option would bring is greater AI demand for consumer cards.",Positive
Intel,"SLI, as implemented in the later years of its existence, has the same latency cost as framegen, with worse variation.  With how much rage there is about framgen... can you imagine how the public would respond if they had to buy two GPUs to get it?",Negative

Each gpu is connected to host via pci-e 5.0 x8 interface, and the system will seperate them via pci-e bifurcation.",Neutral
Intel,"Pretty disappointing tbh. This card will not be a nvidia replacement by anytime soon. I think the cheapest option to run LLM locally is to buy decomissioned nvidia tesla v100 16G SXM2. Each cost around 60-70 USD and availability is pretty good atleast in China. And pair with SMX2 to pci-e conversion board.  6 of them can be linked together using nvlink, providing 96GB vram. The downside though, is this setup will drain 1.8kw of power when maxed. And the HBM2 vram inside the core is very prune to failure due to old age. The embedded vram can't be repaired, so once vram died whole gpu is pretty much gone.",Negative
Intel,between AMD and Intel which is more stable?,Neutral
Intel,"Intel's official figure is 192 INT8 TOPS. I guess this is with sparsity, so 96. Then FP16 should be 48 TFLOPS (or 4x the FP32 perf).   So essentially, a 3060 with 24GB VRAM and 25% higher bandwidth (conveniently available in a dual-gpu version for a 48GB total).",Neutral
Intel,Thanks!!!,Positive
Intel,That’s true and product segment itself focuses on AI. But the fun part is bifurcated dual GPUs. And unlike Nvidia they are claiming to have support for both game-ready and professional drivers at same time. This means you can be professional video editor by day and gamer by night (or gamer by weekends or vice-versa 😄) all with one card without tinkering drivers or monitor ports. And by the way unlike AMD they have great support for video encoding and decoding. I am really excited to see all these various combinations of things on this card.,Positive
Intel,Yeah 24GB has become bare specially for 4K and above. This is good intel has hit a good sweet spot each GPU. 😗,Positive
Intel,source??,Neutral
Intel,Sure but there’s no Vulkan needed.,Neutral
Intel,"this isn't a single card. it's two mid cards on one PCB, you are still splitting vram across two GPU's",Neutral
Intel,"It's an option...? Meaning that you don't have to use it if you don't like it.      And plenty of people use their commercial cards for gaming, literally some of earliest adaptors of nvidia cards were chief tech leads playing games on their workstations in afterhours, as described in many interviews and books such as the recent The Nvidia Way.   And Sli was fine once they made G-Sync, which was from the discovery of microstutters as a big problem.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, that's why I said:    >...sell it as nvlink (with some upgrades)...     Also, I bet that most people would gladly take just the standard sli without the nvlink improvements simply for the larger vram.    Edit: I was wrong, see below. Cunningham's Law",Neutral
Intel,"The question is less about stability and more about support.  AMD's ROCm support is basically on a per-chip basis. If you have gfx1100 (navi31) on Linux you're basically have good (not perfect) support and most things work (especially over the past year - bitsandbytes, AOTriton, even CK now works. I'd say for AI/ML (beyond inferencing) I'd almost certainly pick AMD over Intel w/ gfx1100 for the stuff I do. If you're using any other AMD consumer hardware, especially on the APUs then you're in for a wild ride. I am poking around with Strix Halo atm and the pain is real. Most of the work that's been done for PyTorch enablement is by two community members.  Personally I've been really impressed by Intel's IPEX-LLM team. They're super responsive and when I ran into a bug, they fixed it over the weekend and had it in their next weekly release. That being said, while their velocity is awesome, that causes a lot of bitrot/turnover in the code. The stuff I've touched that hasn't been updated in a year usually tends to be broken. Also, while there is Vulkan/SYCL backends in llama.cpp that work with Arc, you will by far get the best performance from the IPEX-LLM backend, which is forked from mainline (so therefore always behind on features/model support). IMO it'd be a big win if they could figure out how to get the IPEX backend upstreamed.  I think the real question you should ask is what price point and hardware class are you looking for and what kind of support do you need (if you just need llama.cpp to run, then either is fine, tbt).",Neutral
Intel,"Hmm re-reading, I may have brain-farted the CU math, Arc 140V (Lunar Lake) is I believe 32 TFLOPS so obvs G21 should be higher.  B60 ([official specs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/243916/intel-arc-pro-b60-graphics/specifications.html)) uses the full BGM-G21 which has 20 Xe2 cores, 160 XMX engines and a graphics clock of 2.4GHz (a bit lower than B580).  Each Xe2 core can support 2048 FP16 ops/clock ([Intel Xe2 PDF](https://cdrdv2-public.intel.com/824434/2024_Intel_Tech%20Tour%20TW_Xe2%20and%20Lunar%20Lakes%20GPU.pdf)).  ``` 20 CU * 2048 FP16 ops/clock/CU * 2.4e9 clock / 1e12 = 98.304 FP16 TFLOPS ```  This lines up if Intel is claiming 192 INT8 TOPS (afaik XMX doesn't do sparsity and they claim 4096 INT8 ops/clock, so double FP16/BF16).  These cards seem super cool! My main bone to pick is that the retail plans (uncertain retail release in Q4) makes it less interesting. I guess we'll see what else hits the shelves between now and then.",Neutral
Intel,But you get 48GB of VRAM for that price.,Neutral
Intel,"Intel has a currently working but not released software to share video memory across multiple GPUs for the purpose of AI and such with minimal performance loss. It is effectively 48GB worth of video memory for the tasks these GPUs are designed for.  These cards might be slower than other solutions, but they will be thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars cheaper. Stuff like this (and AMD's AI MAX+ 395) allow companies to have each dev be able to host their own full size(or at least near full size) AI model on their own workstation instead of fighting over time on the big server. They also allow hobbyist to work with much larger models than they usually would be able to.",Neutral
Intel,"The nvlink improvements are what *allow* for larger vram.  SLI's biggest problem was that GPU memory had to be duplicated across all cards, meaning if you put 2x 8gb cards in SLI, you still only had 8GB effective vram. NVLink allows for memory pooling, SLI did not.",Neutral
Intel,thank you,Positive
Intel,"If they really have 98 FP16 TFlops (i.e., 70% of a 3090), they will be pretty cool and better value than a heavily used 3090 (if we ignore the CUDA advantage)",Positive

Intel,That’s about the bandwidth of the Nvlink bridge on a 2080(/ti) (which obviously doesn’t do vram sharing),Neutral
Intel,Then just get Strix Halo if you don’t care about bandwidth and performance,Negative
Intel,"Seems like I have to go through this again, but with you this time. So, again. For the price of Strix Halo, if you actually use the memory, you are going to get much higher performance than a system with better GPU but less VRAM, because you'd run out of it and had to go for RAM. Do you guys just not understand that if you are going to use the VRAM, it will have much better performance than something that would run out of it and had to use RAM for the same price?",Negative

For inference, its closest Nvidia competitor is the $550 MSRP 5070, which has just 12 GB of VRAM but bandwidth of 672 GB/s. So if you're running an 8B model (which honestly I can only recommend for small tasks like tab code assist, not image generation) it is better to get the 5070.

Intel,"I own an A770, and the answer is absolutely not. I bought it with the expectation that the experience would be much worse than nvidia/amd, and they blew my expectations out of the water.  My favorite example is that, until [this release 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/releases/tag/v2.7.10%2Bxpu) ([the fix was merged ~march 3](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch/issues/325#issuecomment-2694277026)), using large image generation models on Alchemist cards wasn't possible because they have a 4GB VRAM allocation limit (fixed in Battlemage). Now it mostly ""just works"", but a lot of optimizations are nvidia-only.  LLM support isn't quite as awful as image/video generation was prior to the aforementioned release, but it's still substantially worse than nvidia/amd (I also own a 6900xt). For instance, none of the inferencing tools support Flash Attention on Intel's compute backend (a [SYCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYCL) implementation), which _severely_ limits context length / initial generation speed because memory usage scales quadratically with context size.  Intel maintains a [repository](https://github.com/intel/ipex-llm) with forks of most of the popular tools (vLLM, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc). It vastly improves performance when using intel's backend relative to the upstreams, but it's also extremely annoying to use. It's buggier, releases lag behind upstream, there's less model support, it requires a hyper-specific environment setup, etc. I have no idea why they don't just upstream their changes.  At this rate, Vulkan will end up with better support and performance than SYCL, despite the former not being designed with compute workloads in mind at all, while the latter was explicitly built for it (I think).",Negative

Intel,It won't be 80 Xe engines.  Just looking at the data width difference between a 12GB B580 vs a 16GB B770.  You are looking at 3:4 ratio for available memory bandwidth.  It won't be able to feed the bandwidth of 80 Xe you claim which is 4X of B580.  Note: 32GB is for a clamshell configuration. i.e. the data bus width is same for the base 16GB units.,Neutral

From the past, my favourite of these (although I guess it's a different, more unique case) is the Nvidia GTX 295x2. For context, the 295 was a dual-GPU version of the GTX 280 which worked through the now-defunct SLI protocol. EVGA's engineers had the bright idea of making a dual-GPU version of this dual-GPU card, and so they essentially made their own SKU where they linked up two of these cards to form a quad-GPU card. Absolutely insane stuff, and the heat produced from it and the power usage to run it was insane, but in games that supported SLI (which was a bit shoddy) it was an absolutely insane card.",Neutral
Intel,"YES?  lots of examples of double memory cards in the past.  there is an 8 GB 290x for example to mention rarer ones.  and having dual memory options are simple and easy to do.  to be perfectly clear in case you aren't aware, amd and nvidia could tell aibs tomorrow to make double or 1.5x memory (for gddr7) cards and we'd see them in 2 months time maybe.  it is cheap, it is extremely low effort, there are no issues here, except amd and nvidia PREVENTING partners to produce double/higher capacity memory cards.  again this was common practice back then right from the start even.  we had polaris 10  (rx 470, 480, etc... ) in 4 and 8 GB versions  and for basically just the vram cost difference.  that is how it should be.  but again amd is preventing partners from doing this. that is why we don't see 32 GB 9070/xt cards for example.  we the customers want them,  the partners want to make them, but amd DOES NOT LET IT HAPPEN!  and again the same goes for nvidia, but harder, because they push broken amounts of vram way more.  the 5070 12 GB for example with 3 GB memory modules, without having to change the pcb even  (we can assume)  would be a 5070 18 GB  card then and acceptable at least.  and a 5060 would be a 5060 with 16 GB (clam shell), or at bare minimum 12 GB with 3 GB modules, or hell 24 GB if you go clamshell + 3 GB modules)  \_\_  the only reason we see double memory config options  extremely rare these days, is because companies are trying to scam us harder by preventing us from getting what we want, or hell preventing people from getting a working graphics card even (see all 8 GB cards)",Positive

Intel,"With that specific card maybe not, but it could do two things to help gamers.   If it's successful, Intel's dGPU gets more cash infusion and leads to better cards down the road which might compete in the high end gaming market. Having another player is always a good thing.   It might force NVIDIA to compete by lowering prices so not to lose market share on the Ai and workstation side of things, which means the better gaming cards do get cheaper.",Positive

Intel,"To make it easier to understand, it is similar to AMD: RDNA1/2/3/4 is the underlying architecture and Navi 1x,2x,3x,4x are the implementations.",Neutral
Intel,Interesting. Someone also told me that SWC is a lot closer in design to Intel's TSU than NVIDIA's SER.  The inconsistent gaming performance of Battlemage could be related to a broken TSU implementation. Might explain why B580 in new games (as per HUB reivew) best case performs like a 4060 TI 16GB and worst case 20% slower than a 4060. Something isn't adding up.,Neutral
Intel,Indeed another halo gen would be nice. Haven't seen anything competitive since 6950XT. At the very least hoping on UDNA being a massive architectural upgrade clean slate as rumoured last year.,Positive
Intel,"It's an interesting read, clearly shows that the gap at higher resolutions with memory intensive features (upscaling ,frame gen, rt etc) is very small, however it does appear that that headline is a touch disingenuous, as the 5060ti does appear to handily beat the B580 in lower resolutions, basically all scenarios where the 8gb frame buffer isn't the bottleneck...  Can't fault the conclusion though that this card should never have been made with an 8gb option or it should have been priced as a much more direct price competitor with the b580 so customers could choose whether they wanted the better 1080p raster performance or the better 1440p and 4k upscaled performance.",Positive
Intel,"I read the article, they mention they cherry picked examples - which is fine and recommend neither.  Then they say esport players shouldn’t pick one up either without giving an excuse.  Why? Esport players typically play on lower res with low settings to maximize fps, cpu is more prevalent in these titles. No serious esport game (CS, Valorant, Dota, League) is reaching 8GB on 1080p low  For CS atleast even if you max it out on 4k its not gonna go beyond 4GB",Negative

Intel,"The 5060 Ti is also 180W vs. the B580's 190W. All things being equal you'd expect it to be slower, but it sounds like it's only slower because of the RAM (and you're getting the cheap version at 8GB.)",Neutral
Intel,Title definitely comes off as clickbaity. Of course a card that isn't VRAM bottlenecked will be faster than one that is. 5060 Ti 8 GB will get destroyed by any card with higher VRAM than it under certain workloads.,Negative
Intel,I feel like it is only 8GB to justify Nvidia's lack of vram across the stack.,Neutral
Intel,"HUB is very clickbaity, with their focus on ""elitist"" PC gamers. Basically Steve advertises himself as someone who only cares about high refresh rate gaming, to the point where I think he's said more or less that anything under 240fps at 1080p is unacceptable for him now.",Negative
Intel,Yeah it's really just confusing buyers even more. The B580 literally came 10% worse against the 4060 over a 50 game sample size.,Negative
Intel,Sensational article headline that nobody reads past?  Can't be...,Neutral
Intel,"Their excuse was that esports players may want to play a single player game occasionally. If they choose to buy the 8 GB variant of the card they will have a bad experience in said game (assuming it's a modern AAA title with a high VRAM requirement). At that point they're screwed so they will have to limit themselves to older single player games and esports games only, which is something nobody spending $400 for a GPU should have to go through. Obviously there are people who exclusively play multiplayer games so the 5060 Ti 8 GB would be totally fine for their use cases but I'd say they are of the minority.",Negative
Intel,"Idk if I ever met an eSports player that never played other games.   Real e-sports player buys expensive GPUs for higher refresh rate because they can afford it and they have to. Broke gamers buys these to mostly play competitive games, then also play single-player games just for fun.",Neutral
Intel,"2 reasons:   1. Being an esports gamer does not mean that is all you will ever be for the useful life of the card. The price difference of 60 bucks is worth it to give yourself options.   2. Resale value. When you compare both cards TCO, the 16 GB model may end up cheaper overall (as observed by the 4060 ti versions).",Neutral

Intel,The joke is on all of us.,Negative
Intel,"The MSRP prices aren't bad, it's just the actual prices suck, but that applies to literally anything rn, including amd gpus, and even Intel b580s are going for 400-500.   Dlss 4 and frame Gen is surprisingly good, but they're lacking in raster performance. Think of the 50 series as a refresh of the 40 series, which wouldn't be bad at all",Negative
Intel,"That would require an entire new die, or cut down the one used in the 5070 which is clearly not going to be cheaper. The alternative solution would be staying on 128 bit bus but using the illusive 3GB memory chips.",Negative
Intel,Personally I think the 5060Ti should just be a 16GB card with the 128 bit bus.  The 8GB variant should have never existed at all.  Below that the 5060 could have been a $330 card and NV had the option of using 3GB GDDR7 chips to make it 12GB on a 128 bit bus. If supply or cost of those chips reduced the margins such that NV did not like that option then they could have gone 96bit 12GB with the 5060. It would be a good upgrade over the 4060 and they could have commanded a higher ASP than the 8GB 5060 model they are going to end up selling. It also would have done pretty well overall with reviewers.  Still NV chose not to so it is what it is.,Neutral
Intel,"Not for long, that's the problem.",Negative
Intel,"Not really, always check benchmarks. VRAM alone in isolation isn't the only number to bank on.",Neutral
Intel,"If you had asked this question four years ago, you'd be told that 8GB of VRAM was the floor for a mainstream card. 16GB of system memory was also ideal. You could get away with 6GB at the time, which is why the RTX 2060 6GB was so popular.   Today those requirements are changing quickly as UE5 and other contemporary game engines are switching their attention to current and next gen console specs.   If you want to run games with full texture quality at 1080p or 1440p, 12GB of VRAM and 32GB of system RAM is required. 16GB of VRAM is ideal if you're playing at 4K.   While you can get away with less (and games will still run), the presentation will be ass and the performance will be lower.",Neutral
Intel,"No. How well a card performs is totally separate from vram. VRAM is one of those things where you either don't have enough and it will cripple your performance or you do and everything works properly. Performance itself is determined by the actual GPU though, which you need to look at benchmarks to figure out.   Like, adding 32GB of VRAM to a low end card would not make it perform better.",Neutral
Intel,"That's kinda like asking whether the amount of windows is first consideration when picking a house, in a thread about a house that doesn't have any at all  No, in a typical situation VRAM is not the first consideration, especially in low-mid range. But it can very quickly become one if the card in question has a ridiculously small amount, which this one does",Neutral
Intel,why what's wrong with him,Neutral
Intel,You don’t actually believe this right? Nvidia doesn’t care about gaming GPUs at all. 50 series is just their low effort attempt at throwing some scrap chips at their roots in gaming. This could very well be the last gaming GPUs we get from nvidia for a while.,Negative
Intel,No I wouldn't expect it to be slower considering the B580 released as a 4060 competitor lmao. We already saw with the 4060 ti the massive difference 8 vs 16 gb can make even with the same exact GPU core config.,Neutral

Intel,"Completely missed the point.  When you say ""Esports gamers shouldn't buy this card"" the obvious implication is that it is bad FOR ESPORTS, not just in general.

Intel,The rationale they used - a $400 card should not be losing out to an older $300ish card.   Even ignoring the 4k results the 5060ti8g lost at 1080p to B580 in some games - which is inexcusable,Negative

Intel,"The 4060ti was a 160W card. Saying a 190W card competes with a 160W card... they're very different. 180W is closer but it's still significant.  And yes, of course, if your workload needs more than 8GB of RAM it's going to be slower, but that's obvious and it doesn't negate it if the 180W card is faster than the 190W card despite using less power (but it can only operate on 8GB of RAM.) And sometimes that's all you need so it's just better.",Neutral
Intel,ok.... but should it be 50% more if it's going to lose so easily? Like I think people's issue with this card is it's MSRP $399. After you get the OEM's involved this is a $450 card verse a $250 card.,Negative
Intel,"I would say 12 GB, honestly.  The 1080 Ti had 11 GB. Eight years ago.",Neutral
Intel,"Ehh even 10 GB is pushing it. I'd say it's just barely enough to use maximum texture quality settings with no RT, based on what I've heard from 3080 owners. 12 GB is the new minimum for RT + maximum textures. 16 GB is optimal for all of that plus path tracing.",Neutral

The best runner I've seen are running on Carbon Fiber shoes that costs as much as a 5060, they yield the most advantage.",Neutral
Intel,You get my point or you still missed it?,Neutral
Intel,You buy the best hardware possible to get the most FPS possible.,Positive
Intel,"Yes you're right, maximum FPS, it's like 500fps on games in 1080p.   There's also newer gen eSports title such as Overwatch 2, new R6 Siege, Marvels Rivals, The Finals etc. Is a 8GB card enough for these?   I game at these titles on the lowest settings, there is a point where even I have problems seeing people at distance and the best settings I used are around medium for some level of details, but I lose some FPS.",Neutral

Intel,One with a notoriously... iffy... software stack at that. edit: I am talking about the *Intel Arc* here!,Neutral
Intel,What I meant was comparing VRAM across architecture/generations. Say a 6gb RAM card from 2025 would likely outperform an 8gb RAM card from 2014.   So VRAM alone isn't a clear indicator whether one card is sureshot better than another. Just the way Ghz isn't the only indicator whether a CPU is better than another. It's a major component but not only component that matters.   Which is why you should check benchmarks before deciding on whether a GPU is better than another.,Neutral
Intel,"The CPU processes all the games’ physics and logic per frame. More powerful CPUs can process more physics and logic per second.   GPUs process the graphics per frame and more powerful GPUs can process higher resolution and higher quality textures more times per second.   If you play at 1080p, the GPU can be set to higher textures since it doesn’t have to work as hard as 4K so it can process graphics faster. This allows you to get higher fps but the fps may be limited to how powerful the CPU is. This is “CPU limited” or the CPU is the bottleneck.   The opposite would be “GPU limited”. No e of these terms are objective, they are just a result of GPU/CPU combos and monitor resolutions. It’s all just preferences, perceptions and projection.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel's GPUs have needed more power to compete for a while now thats nothing new. The A750 and A770 both consume over 200 watts but are within a 4060 performance tier. The base model RX 7600 was in a 4060 performance tier while using more power than the 4060 ti. The watts don't say a lot besides the fact that nvidias 40 series cards were extremely power efficient.  Maybe for a card aimed strictly at 1080p 8 gb could still be mostly okay but I consider a 5060 ti to be a 1440p capable card and the GPU surely has good enough raw power for 1440P, it just seems the vram is holding it back",Neutral
Intel,No it frankly just shouldn't exist. It is under-specced for today's requirements and for its own capability.,Negative
Intel,"12GB is plenty of headroom for 1080p and 1440p gaming. There’s always going to be horribly optimized games that use too much vram. I really wish people would learn how games and vram work, to cut down on some of this repeated vram fear.",Negative

Intel,"Oh yes, I had no idea Steve was a contributor for Techspot. Makes sense that the headline is a touch click baity. Still an overall valid point though.",Neutral
Intel,"As resolution increases, the GPU takes on more of the load while the CPU becomes less of a limiting factor. The CPU-related bottlenecks that hold back the B580 gradually disappear, allowing its true performance to emerge. That’s why, even without running into VRAM limits, the B580 can outperform the 4060 at 4K—and might even surpass the 5060. This is exactly why those who hype up X3D CPUs tend to avoid comparing gaming performance at 4K resolution.",Positive

Ofc we'll play something different here and there, but LoL players in general don't seem to care much for other games until they abandon LoL. Even then, they're likely to go to another esports title with low requirements because LoL players have a strong competitive itch. Look at Tyler1 moving to chess for an extreme example lmao.

Intel,"Oh, I see.   Agreed on checking benchmarks for the ultimate answer.",Neutral
Intel,"Agreed but think of it like this GTX 3050 is 8gb VRAM and 3070 is also 8gb VRAM, does that mean their performance will be similar?   The above answer was for someone who doesn't have a lot of idea about GPUs and was looking for a an easy way to identify the capability of a GPU.   What you're discussing is moreso about balancing a build between CPU and GPU budget allocation as per resolution. Which is perfect and valid, but not related to the question asked by the user as to how to identify a better GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"plenty might be a bit strong, i've noticed a lot of games using more than 12-14/24 on my card at 1080p.

Intel,I have a 3080 10GB and I keep following all of the new GPU news but I can't justify even an upgrade to a 9070xt my card just does everything I want at 3440x1440 so why would I need to upgrade?,Negative
Intel,"You play on low settings yes, but you don't buy a card that's ""good enough"" at low settings. If they can get 1000 FPS with a 5080 in CS2 compared to 500 FPS with a 5060 Ti, they are going to buy the 5080.",Neutral
Intel,And when they dabble it might be a crap experience for no good reason,Negative
Intel,"The person I replied to didn’t ask the specific vram question that you originally responded to.   I am responding to their first paragraph, and the “higher frames at 1080p are more CPU dependent” idea. Which is related to my comment.   For people doing cursory research, they will undoubtedly run into the hordes of commenters repeating that CPUs work harder at lower resolutions and take away the wrong impression. Which is why it gets repeated so much here to begin with.",Negative
Intel,"You’re seeing allocation and texture storage. If you have 24GB available most games will store textures in vram up to about 75-80% of total vram. If you put a 12GB GPU in place of yours at the exact same settings it’ll “use” about 7-8GB. It just scales the usage to what’s available for faster texture streaming. COD black ops for instance has the vram buffer adjustable. You can set it to how much vram you want it to keep available, but if you max the settings out at 1080p it shows you the game only needs about 4-6GB to run. I can set cod to use 16GB of 16GB available at 1080p, even though it doesn’t actually need it. That’s just an example of a game that lets you control it.",Neutral

Intel,"In general you are probably right as I have seen these points made before by reviewers, however the specific games in question (CP2077, HL, and Horizon FW were the ones I noticed this on) were using the full 11 GB buffer at 1080p on my 1080ti before I upgraded. May well be examples of poorly optimised games but it was a major reason I elected to go for a gpu with more than 16 for my personal PC, since I was upgrading my monitor at the same time and prefer not to upgrade GPU every generation. I can definitely believe CP2077 and HL in particular would use more than 80% of the available buffer and I'm sure there are more examples with the lack of optimization effort some studios put in these days.",Neutral

They both require more modern platforms to perform well but not the top end hardware alot of reviews claim they need. The b580 has had alot of issues staying in stock since it offers 12gb of vram at a price point that almost exclusively offers 8gb cards.  Ive had my b580 since around launch.

Intel,"They're good and I have one that I use for a rig that only plays games like esport titles and multiplayer steam games. They aren't the best for any type of AAA game.  The bigger deal is that intel has announced some pretty heavy changes and cuts coming and there is good speculation that intel's gpu sector might be cut. If it doesn't happen, it's no big deal, but if it does get cut or restricted, any type of updates or driver updates that are needed for future releases will probably be unlikely to come out. That's probably the only reason I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but for the price its great for someone who only enjoys current multiplayer games or indie games.",Neutral
Intel,"Intel Arc has physical hardware that works ok, but it's not high performance yet.  But MOST importantly, this is a new company in terms of graphics drivers and industry cooperation in software development. So what? NVIDIA and AMD partner with game developers to optimize graphics, sample and super-sample textures in AI for optimization for best performance. This is an ongoing development of specialized software and tools to improve performance to the maximum with the given hardware. This software is NOT available to Intel and they will have to spend years catching up to their competition.  In short, Intel graphics cards will work fine for low demand popular programs. They may eventually get there for high end performance, but it will take years for them to catch up.",Positive
Intel,"Have you considered 9060 xt at all? There has been a price decrease recently, you might be able to get one for the same price as a b580 (8gb model 9060 xt).  Except for the vram department, the 9060 xt is pretty much better in every way and performs better too.  Was on the same boat with you. The b580 was $360 CAD, and the 9060 xt 8gb was $380. After going through countless benchmarks (especially at 1440p), I eventually decided to pick the 9060 xt sapphire.   In only like 1 or 2 games the b580 scored higher, and everything else was in 9060 xt’s favour. Idk much about the driver issues on the b580, but at least the 9060 xt seemed like the safer bet. I wish it was at least 10gb though…. Amd really missed an opportunity. Otherwise this gpu is a beast! I’ve never seen an 8gb gpu do so well at 1440p. Amd did score with that.",Positive

Intel,"They're okay, if you hate yourself get an Intel Arc GPU otherwise get an AMD Radeon GPU or if you have the money to burn literally and figuratively speaking an Nvidia GPU.",Neutral
Intel,I think better price to performance can be found on a used card.,Neutral
Intel,"Has driver issues with more dated and/or less popular games, but they've made it a point that major AAA titles and esports games usually have good drivers. It also basically requires a fairly beefy CPU and it will at least slightly negatively impact the CPU performance too. But when I say fairly beefy I basically just mean AM4 5000 series or basically any AM5 CPU even the 7500f, I personally don't know the Intel comparison but I imagine any Core Ultra or 12th gen would absolutely crush it and be fine.  But the B580 is basically competing in the 60 series tier and is alright, but definitely if you can get it for MSRP or within I'd say even $30 over MSRP it's a steal. Something of note too is at least from my experience and seeing benchmarks, the Arc GPUs normally do this split the middle kind of thing, where they tend to outraster/render Nvidia GPUs of their tier, but get outrastered/rendered by AMD GPUs of their tier, but on the other end XeSS upscaling/frame gen performance and raytracing usually outperforms the comparable AMD GPUs, but loses to the comparable Nvidia GPUs. Although FSR4 and the better raytracing on the 9000 series might've changed that, a lot of those comparisons were from when we were still comparing to the RTX4000 and RX7000 cards.",Neutral

Intel,No idea about the drivers but B570 and B580 which released some months ago are very good value and also very efficient.,Positive
Intel,"The B580 is actually very good for a $250 card as it performs similarly to the 4060 and more importantly has 12GB memory instead of 8GB. Even today it's still better value compared to the 5050 at the same price.  The main issue with the card is availability in certain regions, which impacts it's price. Where I'm from (Bangladesh) availability is actually pretty decent and so most B580s can be had for at or near the $250 msrp. The other issue with the card is it's driver overhead, which mostly shows up on the AM4 platform where the performance delta can sometimes be so massive that the card ends up slower than the 3060 12GB.  The issue is far less rampant on AM5. It performs around the 4060/5050 on a cheap R5 7500F, and is already beating the Nvidia cards in terms of value. It can still go faster if you pair it with the fastest CPU on the planet, but not by much and I personally don't think it's that big of a deal.   Alternatively you can play at 1440p and eliminate the driver overhead; the card has the performance and memory for it anyway, so why not. You can even go all the way upto 4k Balanced with XeSS 2.1 which is actually pretty good and supports frame gen. Kinda insane for a $250 card if you ask me.  Driver support and game compatibility is nowhere near as bad as Arc Alchemist, and people have even played the Battlefield 6 Beta on day 1. Older games such as those on DX9 or DX10 may still struggle compared to a 4060/5050, but the card is so fast you should still get highly playable framerates. We're talking 150 fps instead of 300fps, big deal.",Positive
Intel,No one buys them because people truth internet myths even from years ago but the reality is that those are very good gpus and near to MSRP are a great value.,Positive

I was still using the 566.36 driver until the Battlefield 6 beta made me update and since then I've encountered the flickering display and sudden black screen issues a few times that have been going on with pretty much every driver version since the 50 series came out.,Negative
Intel,"Rebar isn't all it needs. It needs a good CPU. I bought one to replace a 7600, paired with an i5-10400. After extensive testing it didn't really offer any improvement, and even performed worse in CPU-heavy/multiplayer titles. I thought the overhead issue was overblown, it isn't.",Negative

Intel,B series launched literally under a year ago.,Neutral
Intel,Depends. For gaming? Not really. Better bargains. But for a home server the a310 is the champ of media encoding,Neutral
Intel,"In gaming, the B series will generally be better in pretty much every way. It just runs faster, cooler, and cheaper. Outside gaming it gets a bit weird, but actually favors A series. The 310s are *very* good at media encoding for the price. The A770 can also outperform the B series in some non gaming tasks (generally its inferior, but it can get 4gb more vram and has a wider bus, which can make it better, or sometimes close enough that it being older and thus cheaper can make up the difference.) For gaming, B series is strictly better",Positive
Intel,The b580 is close to the a750 in performance. Not worth buying that. The a770 is better but I wouldn’t recommend them now with the amd 9060xt out.,Negative
Intel,"The median net worth in the US is 200k and the US accounts for more of Nvidia’s revenue than the rest of the world. Speak for yourself, big bro.   Regardless, what even prompted you to say this? I’m just answering OP’s question about Intel’s popularity lmao",Neutral
Intel,Totally fine.,Positive
Intel,"Given you dont need to run DDU or (in some cases) do a fresh install of Windows to get the cards to run decently id argue theyre pretty well refined.   Even compared to AMDs drivers Nvidias just tend to work without much effort, from what ive been seeing it sounds like bf6 has had a ton of issues regardless of which gpu youve got. Having a set of rough updates off the back of 20+ years of development doesnt discount the amount of time theyve had to work on getting things working well. Intels 1st dgpus came out in 2022 IIRC",Neutral
Intel,Sure it can. You can get a 3070 at the cost or a 3070 Ti for a little more and it beats the B580.  I just sold my 3070 Ti for $290 a month ago because that's all people were willing to buy at. Some sold the card for even less.,Negative
Intel,"A used b580 is better price to performance, they’re just kinda speaking arbitrarily",Neutral
Intel,3070 or 3070 Ti. One may cost more. I sold my 3070 Ti for $290 and others are selling for less.,Neutral
Intel,"Wrong, the B580 outperforms the A770 in every case i know.",Neutral
Intel,You’re comparing the used market to the new market. You can get a used B580 for $170 on ebay as the first listing I see.,Neutral
Intel,"Not arbitrary with my assumption they want to spend $250 on a new B580. I don't know for sure they wanted to go new, but in case it was their plan, I'm saying instead of spending $250 on a new one if that's what their plan is, just spend $250 on a used card which will have better performance. It's really common sensical as to what I am saying. Don't understand what is arbitrary about that.",Neutral
Intel,"Wrong. The A770 has more VRAM and works better for AI/ML workloads.  That's why they're releasing other cards to help with loading models.    As for gaming performance, the A770 and B580 are very close in most benchmarks.  It's game dependent which one does better, but in scenarios more vram is needed the A770 wins.  12GB isn't terrible for 1080p/1440p workloads but it's just OK.",Neutral
Intel,"Indeed, that was my intent and my assumption that OP was going to go for new. $250 spent on a used card is spent better than on a new B580.  I don't think this point is invalid to the point where it should be downvoted.",Neutral
Intel,"Ok… but if OP is willing to buy used cards, $170 is better spent on a used B580 than $250 on a 3070 as you can spend the extra $80 to get other components that are better as well",Neutral
Intel,"Sure this is true, but I was only talking about going for a brand new B580 versus a used GPU. I naturally assume at such a low price point that people will go brand new on that GPU rather than used.  You can argue different scenarios with a different good answer, but what you stated wasn't exactly relevant to my assumption.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, but your assumption is inherently flawed is all I’m pointing out.",Neutral
Intel,"No, my assumption isn't flawed when I had no evidence to suggest that OP was going used on that card. How can I possibly know what OP intends on doing without it having been explicitly stated? I would personally expect them to go for a new card and not used as the card is already cheap enough to get it new (without considering budget constraints, but they also never stated any details on a budget and other essential info).   Hindsight and what comes after the comment was made is different, but my comment was based entirely on a very specific scenario. I think it's clear from my comment that I was specifically discussing differences between a new B580 and a different used card. I wasn't talking about anything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Your comment here already dismantles the scenario you thought of. You claimed you assumed they would be going for a new card. This assumption automatically means that going for a used card is out of the question, so comparing the new card to the used card doesn’t make sense. If OP were to be considering going used on cards, why would they not consider going used on the B580? The problem is that you didn’t think to expand the logic you presented beyond one specific card, which is inherently flawed.",Negative
Intel,For what purpose? Because if gaming is your goal this is not the play unless you’re refusing both AMD and Nvidia graphics for ideological reasons.,Negative
Intel,"So my goal is to get you to a RTX 5070 which requires $280 of reallocation.  - Downgrade the CPU to a 9600X. $160 saved  - You have three M.2 slots on your motherboard, you don’t need 4TB to start. Drop to 2TB $130 saved.  - Replace the Arc with an RTX 5070  Alternatively you can make a less severe CPU cut with the 7700X ($60 saved) and get the other $100 from your peripheral budget because frankly you don’t need $500 for all that. You could also downgrade the case to something with less fancy rgb (Montech XR, Phanteks XT View) but I understand some folks are very passionate with their case selection.",Neutral

I was interested initially because of the RAM in the dual Maxsun card, but was hoping for a price closer to $2,000 NZD.",Negative
Intel,Why specifically the Intel when plenty of GPUs aren't going to interfere with AI.,Neutral
Intel,That's an interesting idea :) I'm not in the US but going to China to buy some hardware sounds very cool! Maybe I'll do it some day. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,"My idea was to buy a singular one now and another one later when I have the money for it. But dual variants look cool too if you can afford it. $2000 USD sounds too much though. I feel like the supplier in your area is jacking up the prices since it is difficult to find them.  I asked a friend of mine who does business hardware deals. He couldn't even get a quote. I guess it is not even available on many regions now.  Anyway, thanks for the info :)",Positive
Intel,24GB VRAM for 500$ sounds super nice and not offered by any other GPU manufacturer. Plus they advertised a card with dual B60s (48GB VRAM total) sharing one PCI-E x16 slot (x8 each).,Positive
Intel,"Then price the GPUs that have Tensor cores. I'm just wondering because Intel GPUs aren't traditionally for gaming, though that is slowly changing",Neutral
Intel,"Tensor cores is not the only thing that matters when it comes to performance. B60 performance was looking pretty good in the demos but now there is nothing on the internet, no benchmarks, no prices, no people with crazy connections showing off a hardware others cannot buy, nothing.",Negative
Intel,You have a very narrow vision of speed. What you are saying is like your truck is faster than my audi because it has more horsepower. Nvidia is the top dog right now but that doesn't mean you get more from nvidia for 200$. VRAM size and speed is something you cannot ignore. If you have to load half of the model to system memory it is gonna decrease your speed significantly. And guess what? If you can't fit the model into your memory you won't be running it even if you have a billion cuda cores. This is why intel is offering 24GB VRAM for 500$ while you need to pay 2500$ for the same VRAM size in nvidia (rtx a5000 for example).,Negative
Intel,"But compared head to head with an nVidia or AMD/ATI of the same price and the Intel is not the top performer, last I checked.   I looked into this recently because I was thinking about upgrading.  $200 for that versus $200 for an nVidia/AMD and the non-Intel GPU was a slightly better performer.",Negative

Intel,"Driver support in games is very good these days, I have had considerably more issues on my NVIDIA PC than on my arc PC, over the last six months or so (I've also used that one more but still felt like a worse overall experience in terms of gaming drivers). Productivity software is a different story and a bit hit or miss, in my experience especially Adobe Photoshop and to a lesser extent After Effects don't play nicely with Arc.  XESS 2 is also really good, I think right now it's generally the worst upscaler between itself, FSR4 and DLSS 4 but it's by a very small margin to a point where it depends on a game by game basis. Biggest problem is the lack of widespread adoption. XESS framegen works great.   Ray tracing compares pretty well to competing AMD and NVIDIA cards, in terms of raster performance to RT ratio it seems to land somewhere in the middle between RDNA 4 and Blackwell. That being said it's still a low end card, so you're not gonna be running heavy RT workloads in it.  I think the biggest issues are the higher CPU overhead, requirement for rebar and only supporting an x8 PCIe connection, somewhat limiting it as a viable budget upgrade for older systems.  It's more of a 1080p card for modern AAA games, that can work with a 1440p monitor in a pinch. For $260 I think it's decent and NVIDIA and AMD don't really offer anything better in the sub $300 range.",Negative
Intel,"Using my 3-fan B580 OC for 1440 gaming and it does a good job. I love its non existent noise level. Back in march I bought it for 330€. Updated driver is released like every 1-3 weeks. I appreciate intel's clean and intuitive driver GUI. I love the way the driver handles crashes, it's exemplary. The driver literally invites to try out some OC. Don't regret my B580. If I'd buy a new card right now, I'd be torn apart between B580 or 9060 XT.   But my main goal was/is a decent gaming experience with a  reasonable power consumption. I don't have a problem to fine tune settings to get stable 60 FPS and a flatline frametime. And it was a decision against NVIDIA, against their dominant position, which they exploit and hurt the market.",Positive
Intel,It has bad driver overhead and isn't great for now end systems.  It also doesn't have that great price to performance now that both AMD and Nvidia have released newer gpus.  I would take the 5060 over it at 1080p.  Far less driver overhead for Nvidia.  Dlss 4 is far better than xess,Negative
Intel,"To some degree, yes. But don't expect amazing energy efficiency with the card, its somehow the same performance as the RTX4060, but is 190 watts. Even if the 12GBs of VRAM makes it suitable for 1440p gaming",Neutral
Intel,"While I’m sure you want to take advice from someone with that username all day, yes it’s a good card. It’s certainly better for 1080 but especially with a string CPU is going to do most things very well. I have no issue at all with mine and it often stays so cool the fans don’t even turn on.",Positive
Intel,"I'd say find a used card if you can as you'll usually get better value out of a used card. B580 is not a 1440p card, it's a 1080p card.",Neutral
Intel,its a 1440p card wdym,Neutral
Intel,"Looking at benchmarks, it is really quite underwhelming compared to my old 3070 Ti (which I just sold for $295), which was enough to do 1440p at 144FPS at medium settings. It's definitely not a 1440p card that's going to give you high fps on modern titles. imo a proper 1440p card would be more like a card like a 5070 Ti which can actually do 1440p 144+ fps at highest settings, but 1440p and above with highest settings aren't really budget territory. You'll find that a majority of PC gamers are still playing at 1080p because 1440p isn't offering a great experience on cards lower than a 3070. And I would do the same myself if I had such a low end card.",Negative
Intel,"The 3070ti is a good card, but not that high in performance. Also that card WAS a 1440p capable card, now it can't go any higher than 1080p due to a lack of VRAM, not unless you had that rare 16GB version (which only a few were made)  The B580 can still very much do 1440p 60fps ultra quality, since ultra quality in games is more suited for 1440p compared to maximum settings",Neutral
Intel,"Most tasks in 3D/CG/VFX are predominantly single threaded, until you simulate (not always), render or export something when more multithreaded performance is nice to have available. A 7600 has solid single core performance and in day to day performance will be great.  2x8GB is a mistake though, at least get 2x16GB - preferably 6000cl30 (cl32 and cl36 are fine if the price difference is big). You can save on the cooler for now, use the stock one (comes with a 7600) until she has enough saved for an upgrade.  The Intel Arc A750 is certainly a contentious choice. The only reason I'd go arc at that price point is if she'll be doing a lot of high res video editing, otherwise I'd look at alternatives, possibly second hand. A 3060 12GB would be a nice to have for 3D as NVidia is completely dominant in that space, but you'd probably need some second hand luck; I find them for around 200 EUR in the Netherlands. It'll perform a bit better than the A750 in gaming too, and has way better software support.  You can always save on the case and may be able to shave off a bit going for an mATX board, though less than 140 EUR for a wifi one is unlikely.",Positive
Intel,"All parts look good but something to consider is some software just runs better on nvidia than others. I know this is true with video editing so maybe look at any applications she’ll need to run and see how the performance is before going with the intel card.   This is as good as I could manage being 100 over budget assuming the applications for vfx, cgi etc would play nicer with an nvidia card but don’t know for certain.

Intel,9060 XT is just like 10% better. Stay with the B580 until 2027,Positive
Intel,9060xt is prolly faster but for the price/p b580 prolly is the best rn  if u have the b580 then just stick with it until the next intel card like celestials or something unless ur running into issues with ur games i guess,Positive
Intel,"I saw you bought the b580. Considering it, can you tell me how it's doing so far? Any issues with any games?",Neutral
Intel,I wouldn’t fidget if I already had B580 coming in. It’s got 12GB of VRAM and quite a bit cheaper than 9060XT 16GB and not that much worse of a performance. Especially if you’re planning big upgrade in 2027,Positive
Intel,I have the Steel Legend B580 and Ive had corruption and cold crashes with Hitman 3 and the latest drivers removed my optimizations as the features were gone!  So it has been frustrating if not annoying however it makes me sad to get rid of it like the others say when it works nice thats nice.  I'm calling the B580 a hassle but its not junk its simply not getting top tier support for layered driver support.   Bought the Sapphire Pulse 9060XT OC 16Gb and it matches is little siblin' the 6600XT OC i still use on my second PC.  Hitman 3 for me went from 127 FPS down to at least 60 fps with the former Tessellation off.  The Radeon is everything the B580 promises actually.  The AI cores on the B580 were interesting. I lost about $30 in the mix but Ive had the B580 all Summer.  Sad,Negative
Intel,"If you are not having any issues, then why change? The B580 is a pretty good card (I recommend watching LinusTechTips video on it, 2 people changed their 4090s or high end cards and used ARC for some time). Plus, its performance is just getting better wich each driver update, and more games are adapting XeSS faster than FSR (lol).",Positive
Intel,"okey thanks for the suggestion, good day mate!",Positive
Intel,"Daniel Owen did a comparison and it's like 30% or more difference between the two, not 10%, so imho if he can, just get 9060xt 16gb, he get 30% better performance with more vram for 40% more cost if we use MSRP pricing for both, but yeah if he choose to get B580 now then there's no point in upgrading to 9060xt, 30% is hardly a worthwhile upgrade, and B580 already has enough vram at least until next gen console arrived",Neutral
Intel,"well I had no problems so far, I played quite a few games so far already, never had an issue",Positive
Intel,..and if you haven't made the buy yet the extra $70 is well worth it. Likely $85 difference.  Count the extras. This thing trades hit with a 5060 Ti and the B580 somewhere well under and can perform nice (not missing much)  for you there for the $ but the hassle!,Positive
Intel,"Sounds like I made a good deal. Actually, I am yet to experiment with the Arc card, as I am getting the card today. Can you tell me what should be the ideal way to test the new card and what should be the ideal temps while gaming? (ASRock B580 Steel Legend 3 fan) I got",Positive
Intel,Actually purchased b580,Neutral
Intel,..B580 had it all on paper.  B580 CAN play ball but will it today ....  Doesn't deliver well enough for your money.  First game that is annoying you will be doing what I did.  Its pretty nice at $250 MSRP only as others declare simply because of the cheap feature set. Should have performed around the $350 mark and we all expected it to but a long time ago.  This is where the Enthusiast market was excited.  $369 Sapphire Pulse 9060Xt OC 16Gb is about as good as it gets right now.  Then again I drive a 2018 Dodge Challenger V6 AWD not the V8 HEMI.  lol  Two different franchises!,Negative
Intel,"I should not worry for temps, the B series improved efficiency... Just play your games, and actually, the B580 has better performance on 1440p. Not literally, rather than it performs better in higher resolutions.  And look into OC the safe way. Which is basically increasing power limits and adding boost, which makes the card to clock higher with same voltage, isn't dangerous.  And INSTALL ONLY WHQL DRIVERS. Basically this one's are like the Polished version of the first release. Like, they send v1, people download and test it (it's not a beta driver, is supposed to be stable), complain about issues and later they send v1 WHQL, which is like the 100% stable version.  I never had issues with any WHQL drivers. People that installed the newest (not WHQL) always have problems.. I suggest joining the Arc sub and ask any question you have.",Positive
Intel,12gb is more than enough for 1080p,Neutral

Intel,Mine was exactly 300. I like its AI cores.  It produces way better images than my 6600XT and noone but noone simply comments on overall image quality ..anyway I have hundreds of legal Steam games no cracked eh I also own the Epic games version.  See this damn card had a driver update while I had it that improves the performance and that's good its what we want but once the features drop and performance drops (for me anyway) after the next driver update I had to call it.  Its the poor driver software stack.  The hardware has serious potential!  A770 is maxed.  I see this B580 ownership  as I leased the card for the summer +$60.      Can you buy from the [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) USA website for our cost?? Shop our stores in the USA.   I should remind you the Steam cold crashes suck.  I have an Asus 850w Platinum for it and I know there's no power fail issue sooo its a goner.  Im old enough to say ive seen this before.  Dont hang out until its done right so long after its release.  Not a hot buy now imo.  There's the AsRock Challenger or the Sapphire Pule within $10 of each other. $359-369.  Newegg and Amazon,Positive
Intel,Thanks man,Positive
Intel,"Honestly? If I were you I’d get a 9060xt 16gb for 350-370 and then enjoy your $400 saved.  Reason being that with your setup, once you start moving up in GPU, you’re not gonna see as big of a performance uplift because of your 5700x, which will start to slightly but noticeably bottleneck a 9070/5070 or above  Which if you did go with a 9070/5070, say you get one for $600, you’d need a new PSU, which is around $70-$100. And at that point, it’s not worth paying $300 extra for a 25-30% performance uplift at 1440p because thats a 50-60% price increase.  You could upgrade your CPU sure, but then at that point, with a new CPU/RAM/MOBO/GPU and Power Supply, that’s basically just building a whole new PC, and you’re not gonna be able to do that for under $800, nor should you because again, the price increase isn’t worth the performance increase.  If I were in your shoes, I’d get the 9060xt 16gb and ride out the rest of my PC for 4-5 more years playing at 1440p. After that, if Im unsatisfied with the performance and frames im getting in games, I’d sell it/keep it as a spare and start from scratch a brand new build ground up. And with the $400 youre saving today, why not get some games, a peripheral upgrade, a second monitor, or shit you could always just pocket and save it. More money on hand is always a good thing.",Neutral
Intel,"9070 non xt and a psu, nvidia prices for the same perf and vram amount is nuts. I say that running nvidia.",Neutral
Intel,"While drivers have gotten a lot better Arc especially Alchemist still has the occasional issue, but it is very rare in gaming these days. I've noticed though that Adobe's software really doesn't play nicely with Arc Alchemist, so if you're using applications like photoshop or after effects that's something to keep in mind. You're also looking at more CPU overhead, so if you have a weaker CPU it might not be the best idea.   I also don't know how much I'd trust Intel with long term driver support for the a750. Their GPU division is on shaky legs and given that arc alchemist was never that popular I wouldn't wager a lot on them spending a lot of resources on long term support    On the flip side you get much better ray tracing performance with the a750 (although not really relevant for either card in this performance tier imo), a vastly superior upscaler (xess runs on AMD cards but looks and performs considerably worse than natively on Intel) and a bit more rasterized performance.  With a 5600x I'd probably pick the a750 if you're willing to put up with the occasional smaller problem.",Negative

Intel,And look at cpu recommended. They feel insane   My poor 3600xt crying in the corner,Negative
Intel,"Where does it say that?   It usually says if the requirements are with upscaling taken into consideration, as with the FG for 4K Ultra RT.",Neutral
Intel,The Ultra requirements are aiming for 60 fps with frame gen so actually 30 so it kinda makes sense...  There's also no talk of upscaling here which I find hard to believe.   This is probably made my an intern.,Neutral

Intel,Why is this x950X3D slower than x800X3D shit still being thrown around everywhere. It is incredibly easy to configure x950X3Ds so they run as just upgraded x800X3Ds.,Negative
Intel,"IIRC, the 7950X3D not using the right cores in games was mostly fixed.",Neutral

Intel,"This is from [9800x3D review](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review?page=4) done by Eurogamers (Digital Foundry). Captured in a CPU heavy area that they use in all their CPU & GPU testing. You can easily see the differences between CPUs. Even my 9800x3D is CPU often limited in many ways. Not so much when playing with locked 120Hz, but definitely when going any higher.   Edit. One addition. When using high GPU intensive path tracing, it will also tank the CPU performance. Something that actually got my mind blowed when I tested this on my 5800x3D & 9800x3D. Already CPU intensive titles have a hard time when using the PT.  https://preview.redd.it/yyw9oejud0nf1.jpeg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fef5205dddcf03ee0df8972aad5e3b6c8da0f6b9",Neutral
Intel,"3070ti for native 1440p 60 fps at medium doesn’t seem to be horrible. I’m sure there is many settings that don’t change fidelity a lot but eat up fps, so putting some to low and some to high may be a better experience. This also seems pretty damn general of a spec sheet here, almost like it’s useless based on some things here.   Throw on dlss with the 3070 ti and enjoy probably like 80 fps.  It does seem to be a gorgeous looking game too.   However, I’m not trying to defend it, and I would expect it to be optimized for the money that they’re asking. Like any game these days. And if it’s not it should be hated on.",Neutral
Intel,"To be fair, dying light has always been a very AI heavy game, so requiring a beefy CPU makes sense. Specially if any of the zombies can parkour at all.",Neutral
Intel,60 fps target with raster performance is a very sensible target.,Positive
Intel,and in 4K,Neutral
Intel,I don't mind if they recommend frame gen for something more logical like 120+ fps where the latency won't be super horrible. But requiring frame gen just to get 60 fps means the experience is going to suck. I'd rather play at 30 fps than with the weird feeling latency that frame gen causes when working with a low starting frame rate.,Negative
Intel,It still is the input latency of 25fps,Neutral
Intel,"With cheese Mr Squidward, with cheese.",Neutral
Intel,"No it’s a perfectly valid thing to point out, there is a massive difference between 4k 60 and 4k 60 with frame generation.   This is coming from someone who generally enjoys frame generation, but what has allowed me to enjoy it is knowing how to use it properly, and going from sub 60fps up to 60 is not the right way to use frame generation.",Neutral
Intel,fuck the devs,Negative
Intel,"If it's not a mistake, maybe frame gen and upscaling make it technically possible, but with unbearable latency.",Negative
Intel,"I was being ironic. Every UE5 game I’ve played needed upscaling to hit 60+ fps, e.g. MGS3 Delta, Oblivion Remastered, KCD 2 (real good game). But that's just me being annoying, wanting everything on ultra.",Neutral
Intel,"yeah ""intel sponsored game"" but Arc A750 that is 87% faster than the 5500XT/1060 is for 1080p low 30fps, and that argument is dead. B580 doesn't have enough power to play at 4k, the difference between B580 and 5070/9070 is so massive it won't matter anyway that it's better optimized for battlemage architecture. That's just cope",Negative
Intel,"Oh great, my 14900 is going to overheat just like in bf6",Positive
Intel,Isn't the non-X3D CCD basically turned off when gaming? By the X3D boost setting?,Neutral
Intel,"It’s not ‘it’s possibly’ it’s most likely what it is, for some reason many people think cpu > next to irrelevant but it absolutely isn’t for *specific* games, devs put this out there for a good reason probably",Neutral
Intel,Multithreaded optimizations are notoriously difficult for most developers. I doubt this game needs that much throughput.,Negative
Intel,9950X3D is notably an exception to the rule. The 7950X3D was and is slower than the 7800X3D.,Neutral
Intel,"Emmm the game looks just like DL2, and that gpu maxed out the game easily, so why now barely 60 at medium?  crap optimization",Negative
Intel,"But as we're told by Jensen, AI runs on the (Nvidia) GPU, right?",Neutral
Intel,It's with the Ray Tracing ON that's why it requires frame gen especially on Ultra 4K. Stop rushing and read more carefully.,Neutral
Intel,... The B580 definetley has 12GB of Vram wdym.,Neutral
Intel,If they implement every single optimiztaion intel recommends then its more than possible to get 4K 60K on the B580 with FG.,Positive
Intel,"Ah, I guess it's not out of the realms of possibility these days anyway 😂  Yeah UE5 is the worst. I've not *had* to use upscaling on my 9070 XT at 1440p ultra for a playable experience but since I prefer a higher refresh rate experience then I've usually had it stick it on to quality to get that experience when other games/engines I can easily play native and do that.  The newest version of XeSS is decent if you're on RDNA 3.",Negative
Intel,"To be fair, Bf6 is particularly CPU heavy. My wife's 5600x was at 100% usage the entire time the game was open. My 9950x3d would be as high as 60% avg on one or 2 maps",Neutral
Intel,"No, it is still active! The problem with the 7950x3D (and 5950x3D) is that some processes can go to the part without the 3D-Vcache. So you could say the problem is that it isn't turned off, or rather that the scheduler doesn't prioritise correctly.",Negative
Intel,Not if you bother spending 10 seconds properly configuring your $900 CPU.,Negative
Intel,You can literally just turn off CCD1 on the 7950X3D and it'll run as a slightly upgraded 7800X3D. Proper CPPC and Process LASSO configuration will make it always run better or the same.,Positive
Intel,I got like 85 fps in ultrawide with a mixed/ ultra settings. What are you talking about?,Negative
Intel,Why are you assuming I didn’t know it was with RT on?,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is that FG is a “win more” tool. You don’t use FG for sub 60 to get to 60, as it has poor latency. Generally not a good experience.",Negative
Intel,"The issue is I’m expecting 4K Ultra out of a 1440p card; as I game at 5120x1440, about 20% shy of 4K.      But honestly, I don’t care that much, I’ve played games at 40/45 and still had fun with awesome graphics. I just need stability.",Negative
Intel,My 5070 was bottlenecked by my 5700x3d in bf6,Neutral
Intel,"I throttled my cpu and had no dips in performance, temps went back down to 60ish. I don’t think they were utilizing the cores correctly or something.",Negative
Intel,"To be perfectly fair, a lot of people who are spending $900 on a CPU are fairly reasonably expecting it to just work best out of the box.  A lot of the ""value"" of most super premium consumer products is the fact that everything is handled for you.",Neutral
Intel,Wow sounds like a great deal for hundreds more lol,Positive
Intel,"but you have a 5070 not a 6750xt/3070ti..................................   Edit: also, barely 80fps on a 5070 on and old gen game is HORRIBLE",Negative
Intel,Man do you even realize how demanding the RT is? they put a 5070 there not a 5090.,Negative
Intel,"Makes sense, my 7800xt was about right with my 5700x3d. There was no bottleneck since all my components were fully utilised",Positive
Intel,"If money isn't an issue, yeah actually. It's at parity or slightly better in gaming with massive headroom, and completely shreds it in productivity.",Negative
Intel,That’s what I got with my 3070ti and 5600x. I just recently upgraded. I get far more fps now on max settings with raytracing.,Positive
Intel,"Yes, I use RT often so I know how heavy it is, in fact I used it in the DL2 base game, but that’s neither here nor there when it comes to my point.   They really shouldn’t be labelling it as 4k 60 if they are using frame generation to get there. Nobody will realistically want to used FG to get from sub 60fps up to 60, so they should have just put 4k 30fps in that category.",Neutral
Intel,"You won't need frame gen to hit 60 if you have a current gen card like 5080.   5070 has the performance of a 3080ti or 4070ti, both cards for 2K nowadays. Look at it as a sign of good optimization for those that have 4K monitors.  I also don't use FG, but the graphic looks better rather than slapping 5080 there to brute force it.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah I’m aware of all of that, but again it’s not really my point, my point is that they really shouldn’t be marking it up at 4k 60 for those cards, probably in the hopes that a lot of people will just skim over it and not see the bit further down in brackets that you actually need to use frame generation to achieve that with those cards.   It’s misleading at best, as those cards won’t get near 60 fps with those settings without it, and it’s not the way FG is supposed to be used, it would be an awful experience, they either should have listed the actual cards you will need to get 4k 60 with those settings, or marked that category as 4k 30fps.",Negative
Intel,you're probably CPU bottlenecked though the slow RAM isn't helping you at all either. Get a 2x16 3600 speed RAM kit and/or grab a 5000 series AMD CPU,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, you're probably being hit by the driver overhead issues. You want at least a 5000-series Ryzen to mitigate that, as the other commenter suggested.",Negative

Intel,I have an i5-12400. I seen someone say you need Intel 10th Gen on up.,Neutral
Intel,awesome it will be completely capable of handing that and more so you can upgrade your monitor at a later date.,Positive
Intel,"Or just keep the same monitor. I had 1440p @ 180 hz at some point, but I'm quite happy with 1080p now because 1080p will last a lot longer.",Positive
Intel,just get the cheapest,Neutral
Intel,"It just depends on the game tbh. Its a good GPU, alot of improvements over the last generation. A gamble, but when it works it works well.",Positive
Intel,"If you have a budget for a computer on AM5, you might consider building a specification with a better graphics card on AM4.",Neutral
Intel,"i'm mostly going to play the following: warthunder, teardown, people playground (not that gpu dependent but still) cs2, and roblox, but i will also probably buy new games such as ready or not, and some offroad explorer game i saw my friends play but i have no idea what its called (i think its snowrunner? or over the hill, not sure). would it run most of these games fine?",Neutral
Intel,You don't really need to apologise if you pick Intel.,Neutral
Intel,Reason for intel cpu: I know I picked Intel. But this is because my sister doesn't really play demanding games and she is a student who needs to edit videos for school and more. Any future builds i will use an AMD cpu obv. But this build will get her things done. The total price is about £550 ($743 for Americans).,Neutral
Intel,Probably makes it more simple too for her cpu and gpu to work together in a menu for overlocking or something. Idk if they have anything like amd with their cpu and gpu.,Neutral
Intel,yeah she isnt really good at pc's so thats why I chose this combo,Positive
Intel,"if you don't have a 3rd gen ryzen or 10gen intel or newer CPU you're kind of SOL on intel GPUs, they need reBAR pretty much to perfrom well",Neutral
Intel,If you already have Rebar on your system.  Then BUY the B580! If I remember the B580 is around 36K! Potaka IT & SkylandBD got the card within the price.,Neutral
Intel,"Not much reason to go for the a770 when the b580 improves performance by a decent margin and consumes less power. Yeah, less vram, but I doubt you’ll be running out of vram before you’ll be running into a gpu performance wall.  Also, as the other commenter said, make sure you have a relatively newer cpu, not just because it requires rebar but because the drivers can have an impact on cpu performance.",Neutral
Intel,"check for any of the rtx 3060 / 4060 / 5060   i can see some in similar price, you will save yourself a lot of trouble",Neutral
Intel,Some 9th-gen Intel chipsets got the ability to use reBAR in later BIOS updates. I’m building a 9600kf media PC with it enabled right now. Z390 chipset.,Neutral
Intel,"Eh, B580 was a real improvement in terms of software and hardware so I'd say it's ok  But then again, seeing Intel currently bleeding money left and right I wouldn't be surprised if they were forced to drop the GPU market again which would be a real shame but that's what happens when shareholders run a tech company into the ground by not pushing innovation but profit above everything else I guess",Neutral

Intel,"Alr Ty I'll try them, Also Nother quick question, the GPU and CPU usage percent isn't nearly as high they should be and when stuttering the GPU gets really low power like 20w is there a fix for that?",Negative
Intel,start with the drivers first.  Use ddu to uninstall the old ones. Install the new ones and we'll see after that if the problem is still there,Neutral
Intel,"The low GPU power during a stutter is just a side effect of the stutter, because there isn't any frames to be drawn for a short while so the GPU powers down. It's normal. In general CPU usage is complicated and I wouldn't worry about it too much, GPU usage is more straightforward and is useful for figuring out if your GPU could do more work if it was given it, via higher fps or higher settings. If you have uncapped FPS and constantly low GPU usage that means your CPU is the limiting factor for the FPS. Also it's rare for the GPU usage to be 100%, I would consider anything above 95% effectively maxed.",Neutral
Intel,Ok,Neutral
Intel,"Golden knowledge in that paragraph, I'd like to also say that the culprit was none other than intel drivers😭✌️ My drivers weren't WHQL certified or whatever so I used ddu and reinstalled WHQL ones and I haven't noticed much if any stutter, will benchmark tomorrow to see usages!",Neutral

Intel,"Swapping RAM is a bad idea. DDR4 is overpriced since we aren't getting any more stock. Also, you can probably just clock up your RAM manually with some trial and error (e.g. I got a 3000/15 kit and clocked it to 3600/16).  As for the GPU: An RX 9070 should be around 30% faster than a 3080 on average. For Cyberpunk specifically, the RX 9070 should even be close to 50% faster. And you'd save some money due to lower consumption on top of that (usually \~2-3ct/h gaming, which won't make a big difference at that cost, but it is something to keep in mind).",Negative
Intel,">My idea is to upgrade the GPU to a RX 9070XT (most important factor being 16Gb VRAM)  a RX 9070XT would be about a 40% improvement in 1440p it's in the range where you really fell the boost.  is it worth is another question, up to you to know if 650-700€ for a 40% lift is enough.  in your own exemple of recommended spec you can play at 1440p High with a 3060 Ti and DLSS balance so the 3080 a still lots of life for that resolution and I would keep it. The only reason I changed mine is because I brought a 4K screen in the mean time.  >and to swap my RAM for a DDR4-3600 CL18 (32Gb) kit.  I would not invest in DDR4 ram at that point, better to keep the money aside for the next CPU/RAM/MB update.",Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't. Save more money for a completely new platform (AM5) and new generation of GPUs. This PC is good enough for at least 2 years still. Games you listed run well enough on your PC.,Neutral
Intel,Extra info: this would cost me €900 at todays prices,Neutral
Intel,"Personally I probably wouldn't move from 3080 to 9070XT - while it is an upgrade, I don't think it's good enough upgrade to justify current pricing.  I agree what someone else here said, that saving up for a new platform (AM5 - to also upgrade RAM from 16 to at least 32GB) would be wiser for now as I have RTX 3080 12GB and it works fairly well for 4K (obviously not ultra on everything, but generally even medium or high looks great these days + you can always use DLSS) and then maybe wait for Nvidia Super cards or one more generation if the GPU is working for you. (it's not like when I had to move from GTX1070 because new games were dropping support for it completely and drivers as well later this year)",Neutral
Intel,Mmm… i dont know man. If i was you.  I would upgrade the ram. Thats it. I would keep the 3080 and everything else. And start thinking when you can building a new pc. I remember a pc a bought with a 3080. 16gb of ddr5. When I upgraded to 32 the smoothnes was mindblowing. Thats my humble opinion. Im also debating about 64gb for bf6. Good luck.,Neutral
Intel,"Thank you for the response.  It's about €140 for the RAM kit (Kingston Fury). Wouldn't it be a substantial upgrade going from 16Gb to 32Gb? I see a lot of games switching to 16Gb minimum and 32Gb recommended.  30% to 50% increase in some titles seems like a decent improvement, better power efficiency is a very nice bonus! Despite still having good framerate on my 3080, I think the 10Gb is not gonna be enough sooner than later at 1440p.  The 5800X3D is a beast and doesn't fall far behind the newer flagship AMD CPU's, so I'm very comfortable staying on AM4.",Positive
Intel,"> overpriced since we aren't getting any more stock.  Not true, samsung restarted production as the demand is still high.",Negative
Intel,"Thanks for the response!  It's nice to have an idea what the idea % wise would be. From what I can find in benchmarks and what people are saying it falls somewhere between 30-50% depending on the game.  I'm aware that the 3080 still is a good card nowadays, the only 'annoyance' is the 10Gb of Vram (Nvidia kinda fucked up there and made the 3080 12Gb later on).  I'm playing the new update in PoE2 and put my metrics on so I can see the amount of load and Vram usage. If I run into no issues and have some headroom I will keep it. Will do the same thing once BF6 launches or when playing other demanding games.  Cheers",Positive
Intel,Yes they do run well even on high/ultra still. Maybe I'll even make it to AM6 and UDNA could be amazing if AMD starts competing again in the high end GPU segment. I'm keeping an eye on my Vram usage.,Positive
Intel,"Aye that's what I figured by now. So far highest Vram usage I've seen in PoE2 act 1 is 5,9Gb so all good still.  Might even last me even longer past AM5. We have a very similar setup, only difference is the 2Gb of Vram.",Positive
Intel,">It's about €140 for the RAM kit (Kingston Fury). Wouldn't it be a substantial upgrade going from 16Gb to 32Gb? I see a lot of games switching to 16Gb minimum and 32Gb recommended.  You can always free up your Windows install and remove bloat. Minimum for Win 11 is like 2-4 GB base RAM usage, so you should have enough left for gaming. Really only becomes an issue when you do stuff like open Chrome with dozens of active tabs and have like 12GB base RAM usage before even opening the game.  140€ is just a horrible price for outdated RAM. I got my 32GB kit (which is running at 3600/16 right now) for \~110€ 6 years ago.  >The 5800X3D is a beast and doesn't fall far behind the newer flagship AMD CPU's, so I'm very comfortable staying on AM4.  Well, 5800X3D is around 7600X performance in most games. Maybe slightly better whenever the 3D-cache matters. Usually, you get \~10% per gen, but just the one gen step to the 7800X3D is already 20% faster.  There certainly is no big reason to upgrade right now, but it also makes no sense to get new DDR4 RAM. Realistically, you could just sell RAM+MoBo+CPU and get like 300-400€ for it. Which you can then use to get an AM5 system with a 9600X or so. You might even be able to get a 7800X3D system if we include those 140€ that you would be willing to spend on new RAM. So imo IF you want an upgrade for the RAM, just upgrade the whole thing.",Neutral
Intel,The X3D chips don't really care about memory speeds as much as other AMD/recent Intel chips.  You could just drop in another 16GB kit or go for a cheaper 2x16GB kit that's 3200MHz.  Another Redditor in r/AMD tested it and saw only a 1.8% increase in **synthetic** benchmarks with overclocked and tuned memory. I guarantee real world results will be even less.,Negative

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

Intel,"The faster PCIe 4.0/5.0 and future iterations mean that dedicated SLI/Crossfire bridges are obsolete. The PCIe bandwidth nowadays is more than enough. And PCIe is the generic industry standard interface, easier to program for than proprietary hardware that's different for every vendor.   For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative

Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks.

What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra.

AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative

It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs.

However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

As for A750 performance being worse than a 6800 XT, duh. One card sells for $180, the $450, they are in completely different price and performance tiers.

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't. Problems that Nvidia and AMD both solved decades ago that are holding Intel back in 2024.   It's not a mystery how a GPU should be built but that didn't stop Intel from not figuring it out.,Neutral

Intel,Doesn't make it less of a fact that users are experiencing issues and they still paid hard cash for those GPUs.,Negative
Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral
Intel,"This was a graphics card, not a ‘GPU’ in terms that we understand them now, just to bolster the point about how much of a disparity this comparison reveals.",Neutral
Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so? They paid full price for a product and it should work as advertised.  With that said, the issues with Arc are widely known and complaining about it after the fact is a bit sillly at this point.",Negative

I have to reduce some settings in the heaviest games, but then I can hit 60fps in most games without using upscaling.  It makes me wonder if they have used older drivers, since they don;t even get 60fps rasterized at 1080p in some games.  edit: And I paid much less than the minimum price they are listing, I'd need to check if prices went up - even though computer base suggest that isn't the case. The bigger problem still, but getting better, is that when it doesn't work it's really really terrible.",Positive
Intel,"Well I mean... I guess it depends on what you're wanting to do of course, but even my 12 GB card was struggling to do raytracing a couple years ago, so that claim isn't really far fetched.  My 20 GB card struggles to hit 60 fps with path tracing at 1440p",Negative

After years of battling AMD and failing, I made an ultimatum to our ceo and told him directly that I didn't want to support this anymore and that I'd leave if we didn't switch everything to Nvidia and I actually quit the company over this because the response was that it was impossible. 2 months later they sold all the AMD hardware at a fraction of the original price and managed to take a credit to switch everything to NVIDIA.  Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Intel,"And I'm over here struggling to keep an Nvidia T4 passthrough to work reliably on Hyper-V to Ubuntu 22.04. :(  Is there a specific software combination that works more reliably than others?   Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative
Intel,"Fact: AMD does not give a shit about any of this.   We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line. If all CDNA customers switch to NVIDIA and those PO's dropped in volume, it might make them care a little bit.",Negative

Intel,"I’ve been buying ATI / AMD since the ATI Rage 128, and I think my next GPU will be Nvidia. I primarily game on my 6950XT, but sometimes I might try to mess around with an AI tool, or some sort of tool that uses GPU compute. Every. Single. Time. It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Intel,"[Wish i could play Hell Divers 2 but when i bought it took 30 seconds to get a driver timeout,](https://i.imgur.com/FqM9MRx.mp4) anyway i decided to not switch NVIDIA cos i also well usually play a lot of World of Warcraft but that game has problems for both AMD in form of freezes and driver timeouts gradually getting worse until you update drivers again, cos shader cache gets reset it stops crashing again for couple of days, then starts crashing more frequently and the frequency varies per user and what they doing as well as if their some sort of memory leak.  Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

I think they're the defense of a brand like it they are defending their sports club.  We're stuck between the overpriced that just work, and the nightmare the AMD software overall is. I get it for the normal user and some power users, if we look at normal windows usage, adrenalin is such a good attempt to have everything on one software bundle, the overclock, the tuning, the overlay, the recording. All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...  I'm not debugging the same as you are, I am mostly troubleshooting, I only use regular Linux, normal windows, virtualize one machine I use and some I try also virtualized, and configuring some basic routing through Linux server, but still I bought one AMD card, and I already did more than 6 bug reports to AMD to fix a bug with my specific hardware setup regarding the adrenalin causing stuttering in the OS every few seconds and in my long IT experience not focused on the debugging and coding of things but more on the troubleshoot and fixing of computers, hardware/software wise I must say that what I think is: They tried to do it all in one, they wanted to put the foot on the door to face the overpriced green team, great software/hardware specs, something that would put normal users with a power software suit that could do it all. Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?  ""I have had X AMD GPUs, with Y experience in computers, never had a problem!""  Or even better, ""That is because you suck at computers"" said by some NPC that doesn't even know what an OS is..  I really hope your letter gets where it needs to go, and please keep up the good job. I still hope AMD steers in the right direction so it can put Nvidia to shame(I want to believe poster here). Not because I have something against this brand or the other, but because we need competitors, or else you'll end up paying 600$ for a nice system, and 6000$ for the GPU.

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.

Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place. And if this is a feature that they do not want to support, having the documentation needed to self-support the feature.",Negative

Intel,"So maybe AMD should sponsor some development on widely used software such as Blender to bring it within a few percent, or embrace ZLUDA and get it to an actually functional state. As an end user I don't want to know who's fault it is, I just want it to work.  Does ZLUDA even bring it close to CUDA? All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point. This is dead and AMD does not care.  * **Why is this project suddenly back after 3 years? What happened to Intel GPU support?**   In  2021 I was contacted by Intel about the development of  ZLUDA. I was an  Intel employee at the time. While we were building a  case for ZLUDA  internally, I was asked for a far-reaching discretion:  not to advertise  the fact that Intel was evaluating ZLUDA and definitely  not to make  any commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.   Once again I was asked for a far-reaching discretion: not to advertise   the fact that AMD is evaluating ZLUDA and definitely not to make any   commits to the public ZLUDA repo. After two years of development and   some deliberation, AMD decided that there is no business case for   running CUDA applications on AMD GPUs.One of the terms of my contract  with AMD was that if AMD  did not find it fit for further development, I  could release it. Which  brings us to today. * **What's the future of the project?**   With  neither Intel nor AMD interested, we've run out of  GPU companies. I'm  open though to any offers of that could move the  project  forward.Realistically, it's now abandoned and will only possibly receive  updates to run workloads I am personally interested in (DLSS).",Neutral

Sure in homelab setup you're on your own with google-fu, instead of paying for enterprise level support.  But the kind of negligence is different on AMD side. Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards. Best of all it's pretty much gaming ready with hardware encoders exposed for streaming acceleration(see GeForce Now).  Intel had been providing open source Linux support since their GVT-g(meditated vGPU) days and now SR-IOV on Xe(gen12) architecture.

Intel,"It's more that I don't want to reward a business for failing me.  If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU  partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.""  ""I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any  reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU,  VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either.

Ive had a few hiccups that looked like driver issues that turned out to actually be Windows issues, and i always wonder if people are quick to blame AMD for issues because of what they have heard vs actually investigating and finding the real cause of the problem.

It was a good deal, but that has cost me *a lot* of hours of troubleshooting of different issues, that never happened with AMD or Intel.

These issues here have been reported on for over 5 years now, and what has AMD done for these clients?  Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

My gaming stability issues were always caused by unstable RAM timings and CPU OC settings - since I upgraded to an AM5 platform with everything stock, I'm solid as a rock. My 7900XTX has been absolutely perfect.  There is an unfair perception in gaming with AMD's drivers where people think they are far worse than they really are - it's a circlejerk at this point.  Your issue is different (and valid), you don't need to conflate the known issues in professional use cases with gaming - it'll just get you pushback because people who use AMD cards for gaming (like me) know the drivers are fine for gaming, which makes you come across as being hyperbolic - and if you're being hyperbolic about the gaming stuff, what else are you being hyperbolic about?

From silicon to firmware to coolers to mounting pressure to bad RAM to unfinished drivers or whatever else.  It's never the case.  There's never any 1 critical point of failure that make or break these products for their intended use case (gaming or workstation).  If you are an actual AMD partner working on things with workstation cards / compute cards, you **do** get actual, meaningful support for major issues.  Does AMD need to improve things?  Of course.

For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative

So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral

Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Positive
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral

Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral

Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive

Intel,"Nothing will stop DLSS / FSR nor RT in new games at this point.  The problem with the rising hardware requirements is, that it will keep a lot of 1440p/4k dreaming gamers with 1080p for a very long time and FSR doesnt really look good enough in 1080p.",Negative

Intel,Exactly! It even got xess so Intel users also can use xess,Positive
Intel,">Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. T  its not much different for consoles , like alan wake 2 uses Low to mid settings and FSR balanced on PS5 even on switch titles use scaling and no man sky even FSR and stuff.",Negative
Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative

Intel,"> what a shame pc gaming has become  I mean, PC gaming is in the best state ever. So many amazing games that run so well. Just don't buy all these shitty games, not like there is a shortage.  Tbh this game looks like standard movie cash grab shite anyway. Solid 4/10 game I bet.",Negative
Intel,Which means if all games will require upscaling it will force AMD to improve there's. I'm on board with you though will see way less optimization going forward which is not what we want.,Negative

So there's that 😉",Negative
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Positive
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Negative

Intel,"Really comes up to how far the rt and lumen stuff can be pushed, if it goes to cyberpunk psycho rt levels? At release it needed a 3080 and 3090 with dlss.   So it could need top end gpu of this gen if its a similar case",Neutral
Intel,yup that is why I will play 1440 UW native with a 7900XTX.,Neutral
Intel,I guess they are confused with dlss.  Dlss 2= up scaling Dlss3 = frame gen  So they thought its for fsr3 too. ( as in fsr2 up scaling and 3 frame gen)   But fsr3 can do frame gen or not.  Fsr3 is up scaling and frame gen.,Neutral
Intel,"Likely mid range gpu and a suit yells in the background ""30 fps with up scaling is fine""",Neutral
Intel,"Likely the same, they didn't want to make the graph even more annoying, hence why fsr3 and rt and xess are mentioned top right.  They got anyway already confused with fsr3 and fsr2 ( cause 3 is fsr frame gen and up scaling it's not like dlss where 2 is up scaling and 3 is frame gen)",Negative
Intel,Very similar performance I guess,Neutral
Intel,Ye,Neutral
Intel,They've been using it since forever. The difference is that PC GPUs were 10x faster than console GPUs so there was no need for it on PC.,Neutral

Intel,Honestly... Maybe fsr3 frame gen can help you but... A 3300 Was already outdated when it came out.,Neutral
Intel,Most likely the upgrade part called FSR 2 and the frame creation part called FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,If they didnt get confused between FSR 3 and 2 then yes fsr 3 roughly doubles fps same for AFMF.,Neutral

Intel,For 30fps even lol,Neutral
Intel,"Especially recommending FSR.  DLSS at 1080p? Sure why not?   FSR at 1080p? Disgusting, absolutely horrific.  Anyone who downvotes this is a fanboy, end of story. Nvidia's DLSS simply is better at reconstructing an image. At lower resolutions that is SIGNIFICANTLY more important.",Negative
Intel,Or be happy your shitty video card is still supported.,Positive
Intel,and we still get shat on for saying they are or admitting its a bad thing. corpo fanbois are so cringe,Negative
Intel,Even 4090 users use DLSS because it fixes TAA problems. And has a sharpening slider for easy sharpening adjustment.,Negative
Intel,When did I ever complain about how expensive gpus are. I've always been in the category that they are luxury item and vendor can charge whatever they want for em. So you aint never hear me complain about gpu prices.,Negative
Intel,I can't market a game for running with 120fps 4k with raytracing on on a RTX 4060.  But I can market 400 completely identical missions that take up 150 hours of your lifespan and empty out your soul.,Negative
Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral
Intel,"No average consumer wanted to come to this point. The market leader started pushing upscaling instead of just making stronger GPU’s and there’s nothing AMD can do to win them, only join them.",Negative
Intel,Turns out TAA is worse than AI TAA with AI upscaling.   Of course devs are gonna use it to cover their own asses. And they get perf boost!  Let's face it. The FUTURE is AI everything. Nobody is gonna talk shit about frame generation and upscaling when it looks perfect each frame.,Negative
Intel,But it does in many ways.,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know who those people are. I play all my games on native, whether I'm using an amd or nvidia card.",Neutral

Intel,"If I relabeled ""Medium"" preset to ""Ultra"" preset and changed nothing else and told you that you can run this game at Native 1440P Ultra on a midrange 7800XT card and get 60+FPS, would that be ""optimized"" now?",Neutral

Now with all the quality preset, we can't figure what quality to expect. 4k60fps at balenced preset? What's that crap even supposed to mean as thoses presets vary from title to title, from NVIDIA to amd. And btw, I'm still using fxaa over taa and fsr when i can, don't ask me why.",Negative
Intel,"You're even seeing this on console, where Spiderman 2 now has RT reflections in every mode. Even Unreal 5's Lumen renderer is a software raytracer that can be hardware accelerated.  RT is the future because there are scenarios that rasterized rendering is just not capable of resolving. Screen space reflection artifacts, light leaking, weird glow on indirectly lit models... I find these so distracting and immersion breaking.",Neutral
Intel,onto absolutely nothing.,Negative
Intel,"Wait what? No performance improvement this gen? Bullshit, RTX 4090 is literally 2 times faster than RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 is only 10% Faster than the 3080  you do the math. RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.",Negative

Intel,False.  guy blocked me lmao,Negative
Intel,"I thought that was on Linux, though I might be wrong",Neutral
Intel,1070 doesn't have hardware RT though.,Neutral
Intel,According to the technical director there's no non-raytracing mode. I'm assuming that means software ray tracing for the minimum spec.  Source: Skill Up video - https://youtu.be/v91y87R5iDk?t=332 (5m32s),Neutral

Intel,Damn my brain must have been on auto pilot. I'm so used to 2160p + FSR quality neatly equalling 1440p.,Negative

Intel,Yep. This company learned something from all the failure game launches that happened this year. The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies. Meaning for example if a game company only implemented fsr it's only going to work on amd gpus and not on Nvidia and Intel gpus and vise versa is true too for both Nvidia and Intel gpus for dlss and xess.,Negative
Intel,Avatar is RT only. There is no non RT mode.,Neutral
Intel,This is mad with snowdrop engine. It's Ubisoft they don't use unreal...,Negative
Intel,"Yep, I missed that. Good call! Makes sense why the specs are a bit higher then but if it is forced on, that's going to be rough on any one with a more mid tier card.",Neutral
Intel,">  Consoles use mostly FSR balanced  heck sometimes they use performance or less, heck a lot of the time even. Especially with RT or performance modes",Neutral
Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral
Intel,"It uses their own in-house engine, Snowdrop. The last game this developer did was The Division II which was excellent.",Neutral

Intel,"Next gen seems promising so far, low native rez hidden by upscaling, 60 FPS target on +500$ GPUs, traversal stuttering thanks to the glorious UE5. But hey, we have great reflections on puddles so at least we can take good looking screenshots.",Positive
Intel,You will never see a high production game from Ubisoft ever on the Steam store ever again at initial launch.  They are the anti-christ of the gaming industry seriously.,Negative
Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly. These paid exclusive games launches only make me care less whenever they actually release.  It's not just Epic, Meta has done it with several games (Moss Book 2) and when a proper looking pcvr port comes a year later it sells bad because people forgot about it.",Negative
Intel,"Is that with significant RT? I assumed it was ""normal"" ultra settings.  Still I can play Far Cry 6 and RE4 with AMD sponsored RT at 4k native with 100fps. This game will have to look amazing to justify what... a quarter of that performance?",Neutral
Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Negative
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Neutral
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.

Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral

Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game.

Intel,It's a 4 year old cpu yes... But how it was built (4c) was like 10 12 years now old.  6 cores are since a few years already base and more and more 8 cores are standard.,Neutral
Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Negative
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Negative
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.   Source from techpowerup: [https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-5700-xt.c3339](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-5700-xt.c3339)",Negative
Intel,"Well the difference is only 256 shaders more on the 5700xt. The 5700xt has 2560 shaders and the 5700 2304. That's 11% more. That's not that much.  The 1080ti has 86% more cuda cores than the 1070, as well as more and faster memory. I would not compare now so haha",Neutral
Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Neutral
Intel,"The 1070 was released in 2016. Its already the end of 2023. That card belong to ps4 era. Wake up.   People in this sub are delusional, really.",Negative
Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Negative
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Neutral
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Neutral
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Negative
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral
Intel,"3600 and the 3300x was built with the TSMC 7nm if i recall, that was 2018 cutting edge tech. and somehow in gaming it's already obsolete. i was planning to replace mine with 5700x  but i cancel it because it's still very much capable for what i do now. but now after UE5 i think i'll reconsider it again, maybe even as far as 5800X3D",Neutral
Intel,It is crazy that I see everyone saying that modern games look blurry. I've known for years taa does this but it seems like I see more people than ever dissatisfied by it.,Negative
Intel,I have to turn it off in borderlands 3. Ugh.,Neutral
Intel,r/FuckTAA,Neutral
Intel,"My friend nicknamed it after his eyesight. When he wears glasses he has 20/20, but when he doesn’t he says that he sees the image about the same as without glasses",Neutral
Intel,"Out of curiosity what resolution do you usually game at and at what distance? I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral
Intel,I mean the last non ray tracing cards were released 4 years ago (1650/60 and 5000s from AMD),Neutral
Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Neutral
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Negative
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Positive
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces. Though that's irrelevant when DLAA or NAA are options too, I guess.",Neutral
Intel,"Test, which one looks better, explain.  https://imgsli.com/MjE3MzEy",Neutral
Intel,Oh man the hair... its so crazy how much upscaling kills the hair..,Negative
Intel,i mean they already arent the smartest bulbs considering they went team green.,Neutral
Intel,Reading comrehension dude.,Neutral
Intel,"I do, but thanks for your interest.",Positive
Intel,That will depend on the user. Power is cheap here in canada so none of thar factors into my buying decisions. And rt will depends on the games you play also not everyone plays tripple a games.,Neutral
Intel,"You need to get 23.20.17.05.  Fixed Issues Intermittent flicker may be observed on some textures while playing Alan Wake 2.  Fixed for most people, also has a nice performance boost of about 10fps from what I'm seeing.  That being said I always prefer native resolution unless absolutely necessary. So far only had to use it in Martha is Dead.",Positive
Intel,Nice. It’s on the list. Thanks man,Positive
Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Neutral
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Negative
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Neutral
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,"I mean, Path tracing is to Ray tracing, what Ray tracing is too rasterization.",Neutral
Intel,When Cyberpunk first came out the 3090 only got 20 fps in RT Psycho mode.  https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-founders-edition/images/cyberpunk-2077-rt-3840-2160.png  Still does  Fast forward just one gem and you don't see anyone saying its demanding with many able to get RT Psycho on thier cards as new cards got faster.  Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Gpu will improve and get faster.,Neutral
Intel,"Look at that, my 6700XT is just 19fps slower than the RTX 4090 in this title.",Negative
Intel,It's a good thing nobody has to actually play it native.,Positive
Intel,Well good thing literally nobody is doing that…,Negative
Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Positive
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG.

It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral

Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Neutral
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive
Intel,"I remember around about 2008 when companies like Asus and Dell were selling ""Physics Processing Units"" and some claimed that these would be commonplace in gaming machines just like Graphics cards had become 10 years previously.",Neutral
Intel,"Hardware accelerated physics (as in on the gpu), is different than what's going on the CPU.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah. People with Windows 7 were using AMD to play the game with old Nvidia card for Physx. Nvidia didn't like that and blocked it via driver,Negative
Intel,"People used to have ATI/AMD for main and a lower-end NVIDIA for PhysX.  When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative
Intel,"Oh damn, I forgot about those cards.  I wanted one so badly.",Positive
Intel,Remember when companies tried to sell physics cards lol,Neutral
Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative
Intel,"In 10 years we will be begging one of several thousand test-tube created Musk Family members for $200 so we can buy a cheeseburger.  But the jokes on them, we’re just gonna spend it on space crack.",Neutral
Intel,"Never. Even if performance can be pushed that far, by the time it happens there won't be such a thing as a $200 graphics card anymore.",Negative
Intel,It's not happening unless the market crashes and they start focusing on offering good price/performance cards instead of bumping up prices every generation.,Negative
Intel,25 years,Neutral
Intel,"The software needs to run on hardware, right now it eats through GPU compute and memory.",Neutral
Intel,And sadly ended up with 450 Watt TDP to achieve that performance.,Neutral
Intel,This. We'd be lucky to see more than 3 generations in the upcoming decade.,Positive
Intel,"Having seen a few newer games on relatively low resolution CRT display, I can't help but think it might come down to improved display tech and embedded scaling. Like DLSS3 features in the display instead of the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Not with that attitude,Negative
Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative
Intel,"That’d be some next level consumerism, paying 1500$ minimum to turn on a single setting in a single game just to play it wayyyyy slower than you would otherwise",Negative
Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative
Intel,"On the other hand, if you set the new DLSS 3.5 to performance (which you should in 4k), and just enable frame generation, you get 90+ in 4k with basically zero issues unless you pause to check frames.",Positive
Intel,So rendering at 960p? Oof...,Neutral
Intel,"you take that back, I literally returned my 4080FE for a 4090 liquid x for more frames in cyberpunk.",Neutral
Intel,I almost see no difference.   And to see the little diffidence I need to take two screenshots and compare them.,Neutral
Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Positive
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative
Intel,"Because PC gaming blew up during a time where you could buy a mid range GPU and not need to upgrade for 5-6 years. Now those sample people buy a GPU, and 2 years later it can't run new games. At least that's my theory.",Negative
Intel,AW2 looks insane. Can't wait to play soon,Positive
Intel,Well the 3050 managed to hold with just 8GB while the 3070Yi crashed?,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, and people insisted on defending the configurations at launch lmao. The cards just won't be able to handle heavy loads at high resolution such as this game, regardless of how fucking insane the actual processing unit is. You can't beat caching and prepping the data near the oven. Can't cook a thousand buns in an industrial oven at the same time if there's trucks with 100 coming only once an hour.",Negative
Intel,My 3080 in shambles,Neutral
Intel,"It looks better than native even with fsr quality, the Taa in this game is shit",Negative
Intel,You dont need to increase raw performance. You need to increase RT performance.,Neutral
Intel,Imagine!,Neutral
Intel,DLSS unironically looks better than native TAA even at 1080p in this game because of the shit ghosting.,Negative
Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Positive
Intel,">only then they become great features  Watch this happen with ""fake frames"" FSR3 in real time",Negative
Intel,>Ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick   This line was already false years ago when control launched. Now it’s just absurd,Negative
Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative
Intel,Much more fps :) Newer generation cards have at least 50-60% better raster performance then prev gen.,Positive
Intel,The Evangelical Church of Native,Neutral
Intel,"So just to be clear, you don't like running games at native resolution? Because the purpose of DLSS is to improve performance by specifically not running at native resolution",Negative
Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is greatly optimized. It looks fantastic for the hardware it asks. Starfield looks like game from 5 years that asks hardware from the future.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah, sure, now go back to play starfield.",Neutral
Intel,"There literally is a /s, what else do you need to detect sarcasm?",Neutral
Intel,"Someone made a really cool comment yesterdays on Reddit that even a generated frame using path tracing is less fake than a rasterized frame. It is effectively closer to reference truth. I had never thought about it that way, but people really are clutching their pearls with this shit",Positive

Intel,haha this is gold 🥇,Neutral
Intel,"At the moment, it’s definitely what it seems like.  Especially seeing how there’s only one card on the planet that can run this. Do you have a 4090?",Neutral

Not at all, in fact another AAA game with ""path tracing"" is coming out next month.  >The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native  Forget ""native"", that ship has already sailed. Nvidia, AMD and Intel are all working on machine learning techniques, and several game developers are starting to optimize their games around DLSS/FSR.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, not even close.  Shaders 3.0 - that's improvement. Ray tracing is noticeable, but nowhere near to justify the hit.  I've looked techpowerup comparison RT vs LOW (lol). Low looked far better and cleaner, then blurry mess of RT (Overdrive).   I don't need ""realistic"" lighting, I need pleasent bisual part with good gameplay. For ghraphics I have a window in my appartment.",Neutral
Intel,"In a screenshot, sure. When actually playing the game, unless the fps is low enough to remind them, 99,99% of people will forget if they left it on or not.",Negative
Intel,Pixar movies will sometimes take the better part of a day to render a single 4k frame on a render farm. So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative
Intel,Man you had to lap your q9300 to hit 3.0ghz? Those chips really weren't OC friendly.  My q6600 hummed along 3.2 no problem on 92mm arctic freezer and a slight voltage bump.  I was so pumped when I upgraded to a gtx 260. Crysis was a dream.,Positive
Intel,Funnily Crysis still have better destructible environments than Cyberpunk has tho,Positive
Intel,"This. People losing their shit either weren't around when Crysis launched or have forgotten just how demanding it was . PT CP kicks the shit out of a 4090, Crysis murdered my 8800ultra.",Negative
Intel,crysis did not do 1080p 60 on maximum setting and dx10 on a 8800GT.   I had a 1280*1024 monitor back then and barely had 30 fps with my 8800GT.   Even the 8800 Ultra did not do 60 fps on full hd.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=46j6fDkMq9I,Negative
Intel,"Man, I remember how hype the 8800gt was. Thing was a hell of a big jump compared to previous cards that came out, prolly our first REALLY powerful card.  Still remember the old xplay video where they build a PC to play crysis and Bioshock. Put 2 8800GTs in sli in there with a core 2 quad which costed one thousand dollars back then!",Positive
Intel,"My poor HD 4850 got pushed to the limit to give me 1280x1024, lol",Negative
Intel,I remember thinking $300-400 (IIRC) was so much for a GPU back around those days.  7800XT is the closest we've seen in a while and not even close to the top end for today.,Negative
Intel,This is still the case to this day because the game includes a really old DLL file for PhysX. The other day I followed the instructions on the PCGamingWiki to delete some DLL files in the game directory and only then it ran perfectly smooth on my RTX 3070.,Neutral
Intel,LOL I remember this exact scene also.,Positive
Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose. Even with a 5800X3D the shattering glass reduces the frame rate to the low teens. Sadly an Nvidia GPU is still required if you want to turn PhysX effects on for games from that era, though I hear that it's possible again to use it with an AMD GPU as primary.",Negative
Intel,"OMG I had the exact same experience, hahaha I remember it vividly, I was so confused why that room would just destroy my FPS until I figured out PhysX was enabled LOL",Negative
Intel,"I'd like to see ray tracing addon cards, seems logical to me.",Neutral
Intel,"TBH, I could probably run some of the old games I have on CPU without the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Had the exact same experience. One scene in the whole game that actually used PhysX,Neutral
Intel,You could probably run Mirror's edge with physx on today's hardware without gpu fans turning on,Neutral
Intel,Last time I tried on an R7 1700X and RX580 I still couldn't turn on PhysiX without it being a stutter party 2 fps game.,Negative
Intel,What gpu you have,Neutral
Intel,Now it even runs fine on a Ryzen 2400G.,Positive
Intel,"And they were right, PhysX and systems very much like it are still used but things have advanced so much nobody even thinks about it and it no longer requires dedicated silicon.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, it’s been common knowledge for many years now that Nvidia are the most ruthlessly anti-consumer company in PC hardware, and it’s not particularly close.",Negative
Intel,Ah good old Ageia before nvidia bought them out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageia,Positive
Intel,"No, you could actually install two Nvidia cards and dedicate one of them to only PhysX.",Neutral
Intel,"It would certainly be possible, but it wouldn't really make sense. Splitting it up on multiple GPUs would have a lot of the same problems that sli/crossfire had. You would have to duplicate memory, effort, and increase latency when you composite the final image.  It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle. Our gaming rigs would cost more if PPUs became a thing, but we could have had a lot better physics then we do today. There is still a revolution in physics to be had some day...",Negative
Intel,would be cool if 2000/3000 series users could get a small tensor core only PCIe card to upgrade to framegen,Positive
Intel,"That's true, but if he's talking about *the equivalent* of a current $200-class card, I'd say about it's 10 years, what do you think?",Neutral
Intel,At least with the 4090 you can run 70% power target and still hit insane FPS while only pulling around 300w which is the same as my old 3080. The gains with that extra 150w are a couple percent at best. Not worth it to me.,Negative
Intel,Intel design will be a little bit different as far as now.  If I understood it right AMD chiplets communicate via lines on pcb but Intel wants to make something like chip-on-a-chip.,Neutral
Intel,bedroom ring library cows summer thought aspiring worm north joke   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*,Neutral
Intel,"It's also worth noting that those early movies don't use path tracing either, Pixar switched to PT with Monster University around 2013 IIRC.",Neutral
Intel,"There is a lot of room for improvement, both in the software and future generations of hardware.  It's coming along though!  Overdrive mode looks nice, but there's just a lot more ghosting than the regular RT mode.",Positive
Intel,"They are still the same thing and should be named the same, your disclaimer is just semantics about the implementation.",Neutral
Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative
Intel,It's significantly better than raster. It kills fps but the quality is great,Positive
Intel,Better graphics needing more expensive hardware is hardly a hot take.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, better graphics costs performance. SHOCKING",Neutral
Intel,People do it!,Neutral
Intel,It’s not way slower. I get 110 FPS at 4k with all DLSS settings turned on and honestly it’s insane.,Negative
Intel,"I shamefully admit I bought a (inflation adjusted) $400 console in the past to play one game. That's marginally better than buying a GPU for one setting in one game, but still.",Neutral
Intel,Sounds like most nvidia fanboys,Neutral
Intel,"If you're into the eye candy, I can see a lot of people that have the money doing it.  Not everyone though. That's around a mortgage payment for me.",Neutral

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive

Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it. However, I'm sure Nvidia would be willing to throw dev help at most developers who would be willing to implement path tracing with their help.  Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral

Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Positive
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral

I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock).

Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer.

Intel,Anyone who owns an Nvidia GPU should be ashamed of themselves tbh.,Negative
Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Average annual performance gains are more likely to decrease between now and then, rather than increase.",Negative
Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Negative
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

Intel,Have you tried dlss quality. Dlss balanced sacrifices image quality and dlss quality doesn't/can enhance it sometimes,Negative
Intel,">a lot of the comparisons just make it look like it gives too much bloom  This is due to colors being compressed to SDR. In HDR that ""bloom"" looks awesome as it's super bright like it would be in real life but still not losing any details. You lose those details only on those SDR videos.  PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.  Once I saw Cyperpunk PT there is no way I'd imagine playing this game in any other way. All other games look absurdly ugly next to it now. It's something like when you get a high refresh screen and can't look back at 60Hz anymore.",Negative

Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so.

The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps.

[Digital Foundry's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhAtN_rRuQo) is again the yardstick for how many small things they point out where RR improves the situation, even if it has some things where it fails atm. But maybe DLSS 3.6 will solve those.  I do feel DLSS itself has also improved in the past few years in terms of ghosting and performing at lower resolutions.  On a 1440p monitor these are the starting point resolutions:  - Quality: 1707x960p - Balance: 1485x835p - Performance: 1280x720p - Ultra Perf: 853x480p  So even the highest quality option is sub-1080p.

Many important Ryzen CPU metrics (temperature, power consumption etc.) aren't available without an ability to access Ryzen Master SDK. 3. Radeon Overlay can continue to monitor on the desktop, which I use constantly. I tried manually hooking DWM.exe and it won't. I might just be dumb, but I couldn't get it the overlay working without 3D running. 4. Will give credit where credit is due, unlike Radeon overlay, it works right with OpenGL. 5.

I currently own 5 systems. 2 nvidia ones, 3 amd ones. And all of the amd ones had driver related issues.  You can't simply work with that. Is not viable.

Intel,"NVIDIA's highest tier? Nah, but around RTX 4080 is the target, which might be bad news for AMD.",Negative
Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"To defend AMD here as loathe as I am lately. CPU utilization isn't a very useful metric to begin with, so it misreporting would be super low priority.

Intel,Where are you seeing this?,Neutral
Intel,"The Adrenalin overlay is good for really everything except usage. But yeah, this has seemed to have been a problem for a good while now. Ive been using AMD for a little over a year now at least Adrenalin and the CPU usage was always wrong on two different CPUs (AM4 and AM5) as well. Me and that other person tested it on my system and he had 3 systems running different AMD CPUs and all were the same. Ill find the thread one day but its been a while so it is way down the list of my comments.",Negative

Intel,ah sorry I meant NVK,Neutral
Intel,"I don't know, I didn't downvote you.",Neutral
Intel,My point is if you've got nvidia card you simply use 3rd party soft and got everything and more. So comparing that AMD's software to Nvidia's is kind of meaningless.,Neutral
Intel,"I actually agree with you, but I don't need the metric to be some scientifically accurate reading of performance or whatnot, I just think it'd be a useful tool for adjusting game settings. For example, if I'm trying to optimize performance in a game, does this setting make CPU utilization go up or down? How much almost doesn't matter. Is there a bottleneck, where is it, and am I relieving pressure on it with these settings or not?",Neutral
Intel,It’s where you oc in adrenaline,Neutral
Intel,"There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Not because upscaling, but also because how important is to have drivers that work in tandem with specialized hardware units in the GPU.  Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  AMD fails hard on 2 of those things.  Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, XeSS is just great, I happily use it in MWII on my Arc A770. But I still use DLSS on NVIDIA. But both are better than FSR.",Positive
Intel,"Then you should be looking at ***GPU*** usage, because CPU usage will not help you answer any of those questions",Negative
Intel,"Problem is, by itself it still tells you little to nothing. If GPU utilization drops like a brick you know something is bottlenecking. If CPU utilization changes in the absence of other data you know absolutely nothing of value.   The real kicker is the CPU utilization may not even be ""wrong"", it may just be polling at a very low rate because that's the other thing with these OSDs if you poll too frequently for up-to-date data that can kill performance from the overhead.",Negative
Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT. Is not that their hardware got that much extra RT cores, but they added custom units to improve hardware utilization, that means firmware level work, driver level work, SDKs with easy integration for devs.  Yep, tools like [this one from NVIDIA](https://youtu.be/-IK3gVeFP4s?t=51) have made it easier than ever as a dev to optimise for NVIDIA hardware.  > AMD fails hard on 2 of those things. Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts. Arc is just getting started, give Intel 5-10 years of time in GPU and they will outpace AMD for sure.",Positive
Intel,"There are many settings that directly impact CPU usage, so of course CPU utilization reading can be useful.  Not everything needs to be precisely accurate, this is a lousy defense. Getting 0% reads all the time is entirely worthless but some accurate reads is still useful information.",Neutral
Intel,"You are going out of your way to defend a broken feature.    7800X3D shows up as 1% CPU utilization during games such as Watch Dogs, Stellaris, Age of Empires. Clearly broken. Undefendable.",Negative
Intel,"And with a bit of luck, they will also hit AMD in the console market.  Right now AMD stays afloat GPU speaking because consoles, they were during a lot of years the only vendor offering both CPU and GPU in a single package, reducing costs A LOT.  Nvidia was not able to compete against that with the lack of CPUs and Intel with the lack of GPUs.  Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.  Better software stack, better general hardware to accelerate and improve upscalling keeping costs down AND being a second player pushing prices down towards Sony and Microsoft?  AMD will be screwed up if they don't up their game. And hard.",Neutral
Intel,"Right, so what kind of useful information can you tell me if I raise graphics settings and CPU utilization goes from 12-16% to 16-17% while framerate goes down from 120 fps to 110 fps?",Neutral
Intel,"All CPU utilization tells anyone is thread scheduling, and nothing about what the threads are or aren't doing. Like the only situation that it marginally tells someone anything is how many threads a program uses. But that usually doesn't fluctuate with games, games usually scale up to <x> number of threads and that is that. GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore. Meant a whole lot more when CPUs were one core unit and didn't also include the FPU and memory controller and everything else.",Neutral
Intel,"Cause unfortunately even if it wasn't broken, it's not useful in any meaningful capacity. Should it be broken? No. Would anything notable come of it if it were fixed? Also no. Given the bugs they got and room for improvement elsewhere it's one of those things that should be super low on the priority list or just removed wholesale.",Negative
Intel,"That whatever setting you are changing does not have much of an impact on CPU utilization, and if your GPU allows, you can use it.  What is the purpose of this question, are you really not aware of any settings that impact CPU usage? Some RT settings have big impacts on CPU usage too.",Neutral
Intel,"The problem you're missing here is that settings that are CPU demanding generally don't have an easily observable impact on CPU usage, if they have any impact at all.  The reliable way to see if a setting is CPU demanding is to turn it up, see the frame rate go down, and then look at how **GPU** usage changed.",Neutral
Intel,"I'm aware that some settingd impact CPU usage, but I think looking at the CPU usage is about as useful as your daily horoscope, or AIDA64 memory benchmark",Neutral

Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral

Intel,"Agreed... But the B570 is 150w, and the RTX 5050 is 130w. What about SFF PCs without a PCI-E power connector? What about low power desktops running on battery (RV, etc.)? What about a cheap, compact eGPU that can use a PicoPSU as the power supply?  Currently, for slot powered, the options are slim:  * Geforce RTX 3050 has solid performance at 70w... but only 6 or 8GB of RAM. * Radeon RX 6400 at 53w is a little beefier than a Steam Deck, but not much. * Radeon RX 7400 just came out, is 53w, and is better still - but still limited to 8GB of RAM and appears to be OEM-only. * Alchemist A310 at 75w and 4GB is a joke. * Alchemist A380 at 75w and 6GB isn't amazing, and trades blows with the RX 6400.  An Arc B50 Pro ticks a lot of boxes. 70w means slot powered and not even pushing to the very limit. 16GB of RAM means you won't have massive framebuffer limits.

They aren't upgradable. And that 8GB of RAM is rough.  And sure, the Ryzen AI 395 with the Radeon 8060S is really solid... but Mini PCs with that are at least $1000, and that's getting a whole new machine. Thunderbolt 3+/USB4 ports are now quite common.

Apple ending their partnership+their own laptop chips have been chipping away at intel's share too.  One company's been rolling losses year after year with falling market share, one is the complete opposite, the writing was on the wall a long time ago.

Same laws that intel has been consistently losing for decades?  >cheaper for AMD to pay from their own pocket to keep Intel afloat rather than let them go bankrupt.  That's not how anti trust/monopoly laws works. Company A going bankrupt because they kept shooting themselves in the foot doesn't mean that Company B automatically become subject to anti trust lawsuits. Nvidia isn't exactly paying AMD even when they hold 90-95% of the market. Legislative scrutiny tends to come from manipulative practices, not from just selling a better product.  Since you might bring it up, Microsoft propped up Apple because they wore forcing their own software through Windows, not because they were just simply selling Windows.

Intel,"Different strategies. X3D has its place in time. X3D chips have to have another separate line to build and now test. No mobile X3D chips so far.   Silicon cost is greatly lowered if the design is the same and desktop/mobile chips can be binned to create separate product lines.    AMD I will argue absolutely needed to produce stellar products because of their past history before Zen 1. No one will defend AMD products before Zen 1.   I will definitely use a newer better AMD chip today but back then he'll no. There GPU line has driver issues and its why all of us just use NVIDIA gpus. There is a good reason.    Intel's new chip design strategy and leading edge fab is solid. The problem is foundry capital expenditure and foundry capacity. They have to build excess and train excess personal. The Ohio Silicon Heart Land. A whole new campus, town, new families, and Silicon ecosystem.    That takes time and a ton of money. And investment (aka the money levers) just dont want to pay for this. They rather get there money's worth of AI and self driving vehicles today. They know Chinese EV investment is bad and Chinese AI is bad. So rather than invest in Chinese companies and not make money, they want to use there leverage to pump up American companies.    This way American companies like Tesla and AI will succeed and win this AI race.   In other words, China ain't in the leading edge foundry game. None at all. No chance. So why pump money into that? They instead are attacking the EV and AI race. So our American companies will need capital to defend that space.   Intel design products are absolutely solid. 1000% they maintain better MT performance without SMT. SMT has security vulnerability.    Intel products are wafer Silicon efficient with p and E cores. Intel design is solid. Just foundry is extremely expensive and there isnt a China competitor. Taiwan is a very safe island.   If Taiwan was like a Hawaii, easily conquered, then for sure TSMC is at risk. But Taiwan today is like an island carrier/fortress. Too difficult to go against.

The 5950X is in the charts, but you never know whether games will act funny due to the 5950X having 2 CCDs.  The 5500X3D has a very poor showing in productivity so perhaps the 5800XT would just be a better all-around pick especially if playing in 4K.  All-core sustained clocks:  * [8C] 5800XT: 4500MHz (via HUB) * [8C] 5800X3D: 4300MHz * [8C] 5700X3D: 4000MHz * [6C] 5600X3D: 4350MHz (This is why the 5600X3D is better than the 5700X3D in some game benchmarks despite the core deficit.) * [6C] 5500X3D: 3950MHz  It seems that the 5500X3D is just poor quality silicon if it can't even hit 4GHz. That's a huge clock speed deficit compared to the 5800XT and 5800X3D. When the 5800X3D first came out, it spanked the 5800X even though it was clocked 200MHz lower all-core (4500MHz vs 4300MHz).  But 5500X3D vs. 5800XT? I'm not convinced the X3D CPU is better. The 5800XT is top-binned silicon and could be OC'd to 4.9-5.0GHz all-core. The 5500X3D is stuck with 2 fewer cores and 3950MHz (you can't OC X3D CPUs). That's a ~1GHz clock difference and I don't believe the +64MB 3D V-cache makes up for this. The 5800XT still has 32MB L3 cache; it's not a Celeron. For those on a budget, the 5800XT looks even more attractive because it has gone on sale for $125-150 and comes with a decent cooler.",Neutral

Yeah it's not like AM4 which supported 4 gens, but i5 Raptor Lake beats i9 Alder Lake in gaming.

Considering intel's current financial difficulties, I'm sure it was considered a waste of resource to design and validate desktop chips that aren't amazing on anything but power efficiency. LGA 1851 still supports 3 gens on mobile, where power efficiency matters the most.   LGA 1954 will likely support 3+ gens again, like LGA 1851, but with all the products coming to desktop.

I'm also sure that GN/HUB probably don't have tons of free time to play games because they have to work more than 40 hours a week to hit their current release schedules.   As for ""releasing new defective CPUs"" - that describes pretty much everything that *isn't* a 9950(X3D) or 285K.  A more reasonable take like ""the release of a 5500X3D doesn't mean AM4 isn't dead. It's just a limited release bin of an existing CPU to clear out the remaining inventory that didn't meet spec"" - I'd 100% agree with you.",Negative

Sure the fastest AM4 has to offer is considerably faster for things like gaming. But it is not nearly the same leap as someone who jumped on Ryzen 1 and is now comparing vs a 5800X3D. The jump from a 8700K to 5800 series is closer to ""normal"" progress in the 5 year period from 2017 until the last major AM4 launch.  Normally, most consumers would see no reason to upgrade in that time frame.

AMD,"The 5070 Super is rumoured to have 6% more cores, as well as 18GB GDDR7 and possibly a small clock speed bump. It should be reasonably powerful, probably matching the 9070 in raster. If that is the case, the 5070 Super could be a no-brained.  But I would guess that AMD will refresh the 9070 if Nvidia refreshes the 5070. It won't get a VRAM bump, but I could see them bumping the power limit up to the same wattage/CU as the 9070XT, which would be 266W. The 9070 is currently so power limited that simply pushing more power is a completely viable option for a refresh.  266W would enable AMD to bump the clock speeds by 300-400 Mhz, which would keep the 9070 firmly in contention with the 5070 Super, while costing AMD and their board partners nothing, since 9070s usually have 9070 XT coolers specced for 304W or higher, I think the Sapphire pulse 9070 is the only exception.  AMD would simply have to push a new BIOS and/or unlock the power limiter in Adrenalin. They could potentially even push an update in Adrenalin that swaps the vBIOS.  I'd probably still pick the 5070 Super over the 266W 9070, but it still wouldn't be a complete no-brainer, since the 5070 Super would probably be worse in raster, but better in RT. If AMD Redstone launches before the 5070 Super and gives a nice bump in ray traced (and especially path traced) titles, I think the 9070 could remain competitive.",Neutral

AMD,Likely because both of those are cheaper than the 9070XT (especially with the fake MSRP)  But steam also groups them together for linux,Neutral
AMD,"It funny how people ignore this completely because it suits their views.  According to Steam Hardware survey AMD sold zero 9070XTs. But there are still plenty of people claiming this survey is perfect, even though we already had proof with RX7000 that it is not.",Negative
AMD,That tier of card is a 3070Ti with a VRAM and upscaling DLC baked in. People should be demanding way better even in the budget sector.,Negative
AMD,It also came out later,Neutral
AMD,The most bang for the buck card this gen is definitely the RTX 5070 and the 5070ti to some extent. That's why these cards are outselling everything else this generation.,Positive
AMD,I doubt that. That card is as fast as a 3070 TI (5 year old card) how many people that can afford a $370 GPU are still on a system where that card would be a meaningful upgrade. Probably not many.  inb4 someone reply me about the 5060 and the 5060ti.  Nvidia numbers make sense when you realize 5060 numbers come mainly from prebuilts and the 5060 TI 16GB is the cheapest way to access 16GB on a cuda enviroment for productivity .,Neutral
AMD,Same here,Neutral
AMD,This is true.   RX 480 was better & cheaper than GTX 1060.,Positive
AMD,"Ah the ""Everyone except me is stupid"" argument lol.",Negative
AMD,"> That's just a reddit narrative  It's why there's nothing more worthless and reality distorting than reddit celebrating videocardz & Co. publishing the quarterly mindfactory.de sales numbers.  * a) Germany is a uniquely strong DIY PC Building market. Probably top3 in the world * b) Germany is a uniquely strong AMD market. * c) mindfactory in particular is AMD's preferred European vendor and was the exclusive distributor of the Ryzen 7600X3D on the continent. Their most attractively priced offers are almost always AMD cards  All of these facts combined distort the picture in favor of AMD. Even during the RX 7000 generation before AMD caught up in terms of features like FSR4, mindfactory had quarters where they sold an even split of AMD/nvidia GPUs.",Neutral
AMD,"They do, AMD has had a record quarter. Its just not as people portray them or nvidia for that matter.   For example, I bet next year we will see hate on forums from people believing as MLID claims for the 4th time that Nvidia is cutting supply due to lack of demand. Just you wait",Negative
AMD,The only way this can ever change is AMD investing billions of dollars into forcing their cards into dell/lenovo/hp prebuilts particularly laptops.,Negative
AMD,no one is buying them for 700 in the US. Only in other countries where the 5070 ti is like 900+.,Negative
AMD,"5070 Super 18GB at 549$ will be far bigger killer than 5070Ti Super. That thing will be ""fairly"" cheap for the VRAM and power it has",Neutral

AMD,That has to be the answer. The survey probes for the latest supported version and anything other than dx9+ goes into the bottom bin even if its null or invalid data.,Neutral
AMD,DX11 came out 16 years ago   “Ten years ago” was 4 years after the first DX12 GPU  DX8 was released ***twenty-five*** years ago. A machine running a video output adapter (yes I will call it that here) has no business being connected to the internet whatsoever.,Neutral
AMD,DX9 is over 20 years old. The last GPUs that dont support it came out in 2002 and ran on AGP BUS. Hard to imagine modern steam running on anything that old.,Negative
AMD,"mate 8.1 shipped in '01, intel integrated got dx9 support in '04, theres first world income and then theres anything made within 20 years, far more likely its just VMs",Neutral
AMD,"Unlikely, you need to opt into the survey. I doubt people do that when they’re debugging some issue.",Negative
AMD,If you write that I'm wrong provide an argument why. Now I can't respond explaining to you why you are the wrong one.,Negative
AMD,They are so fucking convinced that the RTX 5000 series is a big flop and Radeon was outselling (lmao) just because 9060XT is lableed as best selling on one or two pc part selling sites.  Truth is a lot of people don't trust AMD GPUs because of their repeated historical driver issues and below par driver team. Hopefully it is better now.,Negative
AMD,Yeah I upgraded from a 3060 and it wasn't the world's biggest bump but it was significant at 1080p and I'm gonna be upgrading to 1440 soon which I would not have had the confidence to do with my 3060. I feel like this card could have been this market's big midrange card and then... nobody bought it lol,Neutral
AMD,Sure they were being sarcastic.,Neutral
AMD,"AMD is killing it for mobile CPUs, but that is still a hard sell to the uninformed.",Neutral
AMD,> AMD though has itself to blame for it.  And it's certainly not Nvidia forcing OEMs to exclude Radeon GPUs from their lineups.    Good Guy Nvidia would **never** do something like that.,Negative
AMD,"If this was happening in sufficient numbers to make a substantial difference, then why does the Steam HW survey split paint an *even worse* picture for AMD than the gaming revenue split?",Negative
AMD,"5090s sure.   But 5060/ti, 5070 and 5070ti??",Neutral
AMD,That's because Nvidia GPU are usable and preferable in that situation.,Neutral
AMD,"The idiots who are downvoting this probably know zip about AI, but you're right. NVidia is making huge amounts of money from 5090s being used for AI. US sanctions mean much of this trade is being done under the table (see the GN video when it comes back up)  If you're running AI at any kind of scale 5090s are actually excellent value compared to NV's datacentre cards, provided your model can run in 32GB or can scale across multiple cards.  16GB 5060Tis are also popular as a cheap way of getting some AI compute with a reasonable amount of Vram for cheap. There's also a thriving market in taking low VRam cards and upgrading them - I've even seen old 2080Tis upgraded from 11GB to 22GB on sale from Chinese suppliers, and also 4090s with 48GB. Would not be surprised if this is being done with 5070s and 5080s too.",Neutral
AMD,"Knowing AMD too, they will overprice the GRE on release, put it in China only and then months down the line cave on the price and release it to the wider market too late to make a dent in NVIDIA's sales. AMD truly is their own worst enemy.",Negative
AMD,"i wouldnt call ""Slightly less than half the time since last launch"" as closely approaching.  The prices vary here. Let me go check today. 5070: 571 euro, 9070: 666 euro (note prices include 21% tax).  Difference today: 17%.",Neutral
AMD,The 9070 is the more expensive one.,Neutral
AMD,"Eastern europe. Altrough todays price difference seems lower, 17% more only. 5070 non-ti vs 9070 non-xt.  Linux support is better on AMD cards, but i rarely use linux and so does over 97% of steam users according to this survey.  Also you typed 5070xt, probably a typo.",Neutral
AMD,I don’t even think AMD even made as many cards in total for a generation than any one given sku of an nvidia generation.,Neutral
AMD,"I presume the Best Selling GPU list from amazon that has the 3060 ranked #2 is also fake, with +3K sales in the last month? [https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/284822/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/284822/)  It's not like the vast majority of DIY market is avoiding the 8GB like the plague or something and finding other options in that price range. Or 3060 gained a big jump in market share on Steam last month. No, no, no, everything is a conspiracy and everything is fake. /s",Negative
AMD,"Agreed.  I've seen several cases of people complaining about not being able to buy a 9070 XT for the initial advertised $599, and without fail, some people try to run defense for AMD by yelling how Nvidia is also bad and showing 9070 XT's available at Micro Center for...$699.  I have no idea how that's supposed to win hearts and minds. Not everyone has easy access to a Micro Center, and a $699 9070 XT is still *$100 above the original MSRP*. Worse still, I know my Micro Center at least has plenty of MSRP RTX 50-series cards; this cuts down on RDNA 4's value proposition and makes people justifying the inflated RDNA 4 price look like a bunch of bizarre and out-of-touch hypocrites.",Negative
AMD,Yeah the onus is on AMD to be competitive.  Consumers will not do charity. Offer the best value in the overall package. Nvidia -$50 with an inferior feature set will not work. AMD needs to stop pretend they are even close to Nvidia's value.,Negative
AMD,"I don't think you understand.    The 750 Ti was a super-budget ($100-150) card that was also on-par with the PS4 for performance, meaning it was relevant from 2014-2020.    RX 9060 XT is a $350+ GPU that released 3 months ago.",Neutral
AMD,"Imagine comparing a budget card from 10 years ago with a high one from a few months ago, but do you think about it when you write?",Neutral
AMD,"From a sales perspective, certainly, but you can't ignore what's happening in the DIY market, where people are more informed and make informed choices. These are usually people who carefully consider their purchases and don't just buy what's available. If you sleep too long, ignoring the DIY market, you'll experience a bit like what happened to Intel, where it's slowly being displaced from its dominant position despite having in the past almost total dominance. Generations of good products change things, even if only in the DIY market.",Neutral
AMD,Why are you downvoted. This is absolutely true,Neutral
AMD,This only makes sense if your game has perfect frame time health (no stutters) and is of course not CPU limited at any time. So basically eSports games and indie games.,Neutral
AMD,"The reason they test the differences at 1080p is because they want to compare how cpus fare against each other, if you go to 4k max settings you will be bottleneck by gpu, not the cpu  If you know you are being bottlenecked by your gpu, why upgrade cpu then?",Neutral
AMD,the worst is that they always test graphics intensive games. There's never any sim games or heavy duty multiplayer games that actually strain a cpu,Negative
AMD,"this was actually one of the most interesting things to me. I saw a lot of people hyping up amd cpus, especially the x3ds, and speaking of older cpus as if they were literally obsolete but whenever i saw actual videos of performance or sites that showed what their performance differences would be they were always kind of minor relative to the price differences. a lot of the claims are also just wrong. like i'd see someone say ""this amd cpu is waaaaaaaaaaaay faster than this intel cpu, get this one,"" and i look at performances to see that the two cpus are basically equivalents as far as gaming goes.",Positive
AMD,My favorite is when they put different CPUs up against each other and say one is slow and the games have 100+ FPS. Testing Games on youtube does more realistic reviews by using hardware in the same way the average gamer will by jacking up the settings as high as they can go.,Positive
AMD,"> HUB never claimed this ever lol.  There is a massive hate boner for HUB in this thread in particular.  I recently rewatched some of it and it's clear that HUB was referring to retailers serving the DIY market in Australia in the first launch week. Nothing else.  Looking at mindfactory data, we know that AMD did really well in their launch for the 9070/XT cards.  So any data we have shows that HUB wasn't talking shit.  What most of the ""HUB IS WRONG"" crowd don't get: Steam Surveys actually show perfectly well how tiny the DIY segment is.  It simply doesn't matter at all how DIY does, prebuilts will outsell DIY by two orders of magnitude. Shocking that HUB don't have insight sources inside Dell, HP and Lenovo. How dare they not have that.  So congrats AMD, you had a great launch in 1% of the market. But that won't mean shit for the overall picture.   Especially in a segment none of these companies actually care about because it's neither data center nor AI.",Negative
AMD,DLSS was a huge improvement for lower tier gpus too.,Positive
AMD,"Sometimes I think reddit/youtuber commenters can't fathom that there's a massive demographic of gamers who only play those kinds of games and maybe a few other games that may or may not be graphically heavy. I've given up on getting deep into that discourse because some people are stuck on how they think the world should be and not how the world is, i.e. people think 8gb cards shouldn't exist and get pissed at amd/nvidia for selling them and pissed at people for buying them because it's enough for them or they can't afford more.",Negative
AMD,"You dont need more than 8g to play any modern game too. We cant say about the future, but for now this competitive games talk is unnecessary when any game is playable.",Neutral
AMD,?  Insufficient VRAM is a major cause of stutter.,Neutral
AMD,> I havent seen a game dip below 10-11gb memory used in ages.  Allocation is not usage.,Neutral
AMD,"They lower RT in testing to medium because its ""unusable"" or ""will just favor Nvidia GPUs anyways"", but if the VRAM can't handle ultra settings, its ""planned obsolescense"" and ""killing PC gaming"". The quotes I put are real quotes and video titles",Negative
AMD,"These same reviewers are perfectly capable of dialing it down to medium when testing igpus, but somehow that's too hard for discrete cards.",Negative
AMD,It isn't perfect but it's better sampling than techtubers asking a single retailer how many GPUs they sold over a launch period. This also largely tracks alongside AMD and Nvidia's gaming financials in their statements.,Neutral
AMD,I got the hardware survey yesterday so my 9070XT will be recorded in the september one at least.,Neutral
AMD,I am talking about AMD cards here. Come on you can see the context. Also I disagree but whatever.,Neutral
AMD,> how many people that can afford a $370 GPU  This is not a lot of money. Wtf,Negative
AMD,1060 6gb was ridiculously good uplift though. Maybe 1060 3gb was the debait of the day?,Positive
AMD,Popularity=/Quality   4060 8GB literally the McDonald of GPU matket,Neutral
AMD,"I don't have a horse in this race, I buy whatever I can afford/looks nice at the time.  Ended up with an all-AMD system.   Still wouldn't trust Mindfactory numbers for anything beyond their own store.",Negative
AMD,"Or.. or they could try being better than Nvidia **overall** and not this ""were better at r but Nvidia is better at xyz"".   Good luck.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's baffling that they've totally ignored the mobile market, or rather they are ignoring gaming laptops specifically which are always big sellers.  They've got a pretty great, efficient chip that could surely be cut down and segmented for mobile and offer some obvious tangible benefits (12GB+ VRAM at a lower cost) that would make it very attractive in a laptop but nope... apparently not interested.",Negative
AMD,If it launches at that price it'll be Nvidia's next 1080Ti I think. More than fast enough for many for years to come and no concerns about VRAM becoming an issue for about the same amount of time.,Positive
AMD,Is that price confirmed or just wishful thinking?,Neutral
AMD,I got a windows 98 as well. It doesn't have steam but it does connect to the internet.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't use this computer for gaming, but i still have a  windows xp that still runs and all the hardware in it was made before 2002 and steam does run on it still. It's actually great for playing older games.",Positive
AMD,"They are still very popular in net cafes in China and south east Asia, you really do have a first world perspective on this issue.",Negative
AMD,I'm opted into the survey and my 9070xt came back as integrated. And no it's obviously not inactive lol  There's thousands of people reporting the same about their 9070s being submitted as generic amd GPU as well.,Positive
AMD,"More like AMD is killing mobile APUs by overpricing things like Strix Halo. The fact is you can buy more performance for less than a Strix Halo laptop by getting an Intel CPU and an NVIDIA dGPU laptop, pocket $500 and get better performance in games.",Negative
AMD,"Source it if you want to make that claim, sounds explosive.  The evidence we do have meanwhile says that AMD are just dogshit to work with as far being able to supply chips and have not forged relationships with the ODM's that matter in laptops like Compal, Wistron, Quanta etc. Intel and Nvidia meanwhile have and the effect is plain to see.  Of course AMD haven't even bothered to have a mobile dGPU this time around so it's not like anyone even could work with them on current gen gaming laptops etc.",Negative
AMD,"5090 contributes more to the revenues (since it's more expensive) which is what the argument is about, revenues.  They don't need to sell anything lower tier to the datacenters and the revenues could still be dominated by those sales. Also 5080 is I think most you can get in China through legal channels.  Just search online you can even rent 5070s for AI.",Neutral
AMD,"This has nothing to do with Steam survey, which we are discussing and which closely corroborates the revenue streams as well. Its a factor but nowhere near the factor",Negative
AMD,"eh, I'd definitely call 5 months close since thats within the timeframe that most people can wait before upgrading. (I for one have the money for a gpu right now, but am waiting for the drop because to me it is close) Even if it isnt ""close"" yet it's close enough that its not worth nitpicking",Positive
AMD,I'd expect the 5070to come in at 550-600,Neutral

AMD,"Someone's on the defensive, huh?  I can do the comparison of 5070 and 9070 if it can make you feel better with yourself, but it will still be bad, as for every 9070 there are 15 5070.",Negative
AMD,Goes against the narrative.,Neutral
AMD,"Because they have been called ""planned obsolescence""",Neutral
AMD,"It's not. PCI-e 4.0 doesn't change the fact that many games will emergency evict textures and you'll get early 2000 texture resolution. It also doesn't eliminate VRAM related stutter, just mitigates some of it some of the time.  Unless you know for a fact that the only games you're going to play actually require less than 8GB (e.g. that one competitive game you play, 2D indie titles, etc.) those cards are just bad value.",Negative
AMD,"It's a typical case of what you use them for.  Esports games, games like Tarkov, MMOs like WoW or ARPGs like PoE2? X3D chips have absurd gains. like 15-50% when compared to their counterparts. It's completely insane. They can literally mask terrible optimization really well.  AAA games and overall most singleplayer games? Mostly GPU bound and/or just way less taxing on the CPUs. So there you barely see any gains or 14900k taking the lead, simply do to the single core IPC wins Raptor Cove has vs Zen4/5.  So really, it depends on the games you play.",Neutral
AMD,> Testing Games on youtube  That's also straight up a fake info channel,Negative
AMD,"Yep, and DLSS4 is now good enough to be used even in twitch shooters without artifacts causing gameplay issues.",Positive
AMD,"Well, in a few select games, if you use RT and no upscaling, you do. But that means someone buying the card will need to play those specific games with those specific settings to even notice the issue.",Neutral
AMD,Look at any general GPU review of a 4060 8GB - for e.g. Techpowerup.  Minimum FPS averages to over 70 for the 4060 in the games tested at 1080p.  The idea that 8 GB is insufficient for budget gamers is a notion that is out of touch with reality.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah because if you do ultra settings on an igpu with modern games it’ll just crash out (due to not having enough vram funnily enough), or it’ll be so slow you’ll be measuring seconds per frame nor frames per second. At that point it’s a useless test.  It’s not like it’s impossible to test at multiple settings, but 1) reviewers have a limited amount of time to test cards, and the time they have is only getting shorter with each review cycle, 2) medium settings aren’t standardised. Leaving out naming oddities like GTA V’s high being the medium setting, what each game decides to reduce when lowering settings down to the medium preset isn’t standard, one game might disable grass textures entirely while another will barely reduce them, and so on. If you want all games tested to be on a level playing field, it makes sense to crank all the settings to max. And 3) the whole point of a test is to push the GPUs to the max. If you drop the settings down to medium, with the high end modern cards you’re going to be limited by the CPU. If you do all your comparisons at 1080p low, then you’ll conclude that a 5080 has about the same performance as a 5090, even if that is definitely not the case.",Negative
AMD,"It's not youtubers problem when redditors conflate launch day numbers from few retailers with overall sales since then, which basically every single person complaining about youtubers does. The assertion then that this makes youtubers wrong is simply disingenuous when it very likely that their exact claim was correct.  Also, I never said Steam survey is bad, it still is most accurate data about sales we have, but there are plenty of people who claim it's perfect.  My previous post is already at -2, yet downvoters can't provide a single reasonable reason for 9070XT to be entirely missing from steam survey.",Negative
AMD,"No, you participated in August survey. On 1st day of every month you can get prompt to participate then day later results are published.",Neutral
AMD,1060 was a good uplift purely because 960 was a poor uplift over 760 + finally being able to move from 28nm -> 16nm process.,Positive
AMD,"So you're saying the cards like the 4070, 4070ti, 4090 are all trash cards because they're popular?",Negative
AMD,"Maybe in an alternative reality  AMD is an enthusiast brand that has no mainstream penetration but also doesn’t have a high end. Their target audience is a subset of the enthusiast crowd that trends young with limited income, while also simultaneously not having an actual low end either.   I’m sure you can tell how well that goes.",Neutral
AMD,"Im sure their interested but why would they spend the time, money, and effort when they dont have enough wafers to go around. So they stay relevant in GPU, lead in CPU, and compete in data centers where the real money is at. That way they can afford more R+D.",Neutral

The reality is that Nvidia dominates the prebuilt market and the VRAM debacles just aren't as important as people pretend it is. Likewise all those little features that people claim don't matter with Nvidia GPUs end up mattering to some degree. AMD spent years without a good DLSS competitor.

Other places people would basically just be like ""oh nice grats"" etc. Whenever I'd find those no reddit there'd be a bunch of comments calling OP crazy, telling them the processor wouldn't last more than a few weeks etc etc. One particular comment I still remember was ""You better already have another one coming to you in the mail, because that'll be dead by this time next week.""   Well my i7-6850K that ran at 4.3GHz @ 1.425v for the past 10 years says otherwise...  Or another great is in that build I had a secondary GPU, because I run more than 4 monitors, and single GPU can only output to 4. Like oh my god the amount of people being like ""you don't need 2 gpus!"" and I'ld have to be like ""yes, to run 5 you do..."" and they'd just be like ""then only use 4"" and like ""ok but I need 5, so using less than 5 isn't an option..."" - Or you'd have them coming in be like ""You're just hurting the performance of your main GPU because it'll be running at x8 instead of x16"" and me having to explain ""No, i7-6850K has enough lanes so the bifurcation on the X99 Classified keeps both at x16..."" one even argued with me to the point I linked to the user manual stating if slot 1 and slot 4 it is x16/x16 on 40 Lane processors, and they still trying to say I was wrong up until I posted a photo of my BIOS screen showing x16/x16.",Neutral

AMD,15% is totally negligible if you go from 400fps to 460fps. Makes no real world difference because it’s not slow to begin with,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I've gone from Windows to Linux and found it rather painless, but I have a heavily OCed 4090.

With how poorly NVIDIA's drivers were this time, with poor availability for NVIDIA, with tariffs, with them ignoring gamers now, they're flying as high as they ever have! This was AMD's best opportunity in YEARS to make a dent in the NVIDIA mindshare and they failed by not being upfront about their own MSRP and availability. If AMD truly want to gain market share, they HAVE TO LOWER PRICES and take lower margins. AMD also has to compete across the whole stack, from the 6090 all the way down to the 6050.

So when a parent or someone who isnt tuned into the hardware market decides they want to buy a gaming PC, they're just defaulting to the Nvidia option that's within their budget. Probably don't even remember the name of the specific dGPU they have.

By the time the B580's launch the Xe graphics division was on **life support**  Xe3 discrete cards were likely canceled along with the B770 by the time of the B580 launch.  Conclusion:  **Intel badly misread the market and never thought the B580 would be a massive success. I.e. sell out on launch day**  Intel likely restarted Xe3 DGPU and B770 tape out and production after the massive success of the b580 launch  **That's why we do see leaks for Nova Lake A and AX big iGPU tiles in 2027 instead of any leaks about Xe3P Celestial cards and a 2026 launch for them**,Positive

When you factor in people buying PCs to run LLMs, which is almost always prebuilts from large OEMs like Dell rather than DIY machines, it's no surprise that Nvidia gained market share, and will continue to do so as long as AI is relevant. People think gamers are obsessed with buying Nvidia, try the boomers who are integrating LLMs into their firms who now see AI = Nvidia and won't buy anything else.",Neutral

Only after B580's positive reception did Intel hurriedly resume work and we saw some exotic B580 based offerings, but we never did see a B780.

It's in stock today, but it's also against two new GPU generations. Intel really needs to go all in on Celestial, it's not like there isn't a huge potential market just waiting for a good price/performance GPU offering out there across the entire performance range.",Negative
AMD,"Here's why Intel will never make a dent in NVIDIA's marketshare and why their situation is different to AMD/Radeon's.  1. Intel is basically an upstart in GPU, they have zero brand presence or mindshare to build off of. AMD on the other hand has Radeon which has been around for 20+ years. In fact the only thing gamers know about Intel's GPUs is their crappy Intel HD 3000 iGPUs that couldn't run games at playable frame rates. AMD doesn't have this issue.  2. Intel is slow to compete with NVIDIA. Look at Battlemage and how we're STILL waiting on the B770, it might not even release. People are not willing to wait for your product to release, if they want to upgrade, they will upgrade to what is available. AMD also doesn't have this issue, within a month or two, AMD was competing with Blackwell.  3. Intel had only bad press with ARC's initial launch, especially because of the drivers situation. Whilst Intel has tried to improve the drivers significantly and done a great job marketing Battlemage and the product even being solid, first impressions are hard to shake and had Alchemist had a better launch, Battlemage would have sold better. AMD doesn't really have this issue, they have for one or two gens but that was long ago and not anywhere close to the disastrous driver situation Intel's had. AMD drivers for the most part, might have a small issue in a few games on release, but they actually worked and were able to play games. Some games on Alchemist wouldn't even launch or run correctly.  4. Battlemage and Alchmeist doesn't compete across the stack. For what it's worth, only competing with basically the 4060 made Battlemage a sort of pointless generation because if you bought say an RTX 3060 years ago, it's not really an upgrade to buy a B580 or B570. Furthermore, if you have a 3070 or anything else, you literally cannot upgrade to a Battlemage card because it's a downgrade in performance. Competing across the whole stack is essential to getting sales and to convince people that your product is fast. This is probably the closest problem AMD has to Intel, but with RDNA3 they tried to compete across the whole stack, they just got destroyed.",Negative

AMD,"> Due to most of AMDs wafer capacity going to CPUs/Servers they don’t have enough for AIBs/laptops. AMD could have 100% sales at hardware stores but still lose out in market share if they aren’t in laptops/prebuilt desktops.  Almost like what we've been trying to tell the AMD fans for years, but we kept getting told by AMD fans that AMD supplies enough chips and that it's just some NVIDIA/Intel cartel keeping them out of laptop and AIB markets for GPUs. Time and time again I kept hearing ""But.. but.. RDNA1/RDNA2/RDNA3/RDNA4 is sold out everywhere! People love it!"". The reality is that AMD doesn't supply enough chips as you said and secondarily that I do think that gamers think Radeon is the 'cheap' brand versus NVIDIA GeForce and they're not willing to spend within $200-$300 of the NVIDIA alternative because DLSS, NVIDIA broadcast, CUDA, the NVENC encoder and RT performance advantage are just too good to convince people to switch for the price that AMD is asking for.",Negative

As I started using LLM, now I for certain know my next GPU will be Nvidia. Yes I still weight my options on price, but overall for now AMD alternatives are just not that much cheaper in Europe for me (100-120$ difference). So I'm asking myself, would it be worth it to give the gaming goodies in the DLSS suite as well the CUDA I use for LLM and the answer is simple no.",Positive

Go do me a favor and visit the Radeon (not the AMD subreddit but the Radeon one) and try to convince them of that because they keep making out like AMD can.  > DIY is a tiny fraction of overall sales  I wouldn't say it's a tiny fraction of sales, but sure let's agree it's not the majority. We don't really have the data as to what amount is DIY and what's prebuilt sadly, but let's be conservative and say 1/5th is DIY, that's pretty significant still.  > When you factor in people buying PCs to run LLMs, which is almost always prebuilts from large OEMs like Dell rather than DIY machines, it's no surprise that Nvidia gained market share, and will continue to do so as long as AI is relevant.  Who the hell is buying a prebuilt to run an LLM locally? Almost no one.  Anyone serious about running an LLM is probably renting a server, running a cloud instance or is renting a datacenter. Anyone wanting to try an LLM is probably going to try ChatGPT, or Grok, or DeepSeek out online to ask stupid questions. Or they will go to someone like Lamba or Vast or Linode etc and setup a cloud instance. I would say maybe 0-1% of all people interested in LLMs are going out and buying a prebuilt with an NVIDIA GPU to run one. If you can show me some hard data for this I'd be honestly surprised and happily retract what I said. But it's just not cost effective or smart to go out and buy a prebuilt to run an LLM.  >  People think gamers are obsessed with buying Nvidia, try the boomers who are integrating LLMs into their firms who now see AI = Nvidia and won't buy anything else.  Boomers who are integrating AI into their businesses are most certainly going to some other contractor who does it for them and those contractors likely run cloud instances, not local prebuilts in their clients' offices. Any big customer like a multi-national corpo is also likely looking at cloud or datacenter AI too.  Also Steam HW survey is showing NVIDIA 50 series is buying bought up and absorbed into gaming rigs.

Also, AMD constantly fails to make a good dGPU offering in laptop. The RX 7600S was basically in nothing that people could buy because AMD never supplied enough. I think the best device for that dGPU was the Framework Laptop because at least you could remove it later on and upgrade from it.

Thats subjective and relative really. Good compared to bad competition.  >I think you’d have to be an uninformed idiot to buy the comparably priced Nvidia card in both cases.  Not really, you get NVENC encoder, CUDA, NVIDIA Broadcast, DLSS, MFG, better RT performance and the ability to flex you bought NVIDIA.  > The market is fully in fuck around and find out mode at this point, in my opinion. AMD will never go away due to the key products I mentioned, so they’re just going to keep their heads down and do as they do. It literally just is what it is.  Key products?

AMD,"> Yeah how well has selling at low margins worked for Intel?  The reason no one is buying Intel for DIY is because their product is garbage, it's literally worse than last gen (Raptor Lake vs Arrow Lake).  However, they're doing well in pre-builts and laptop because they actually care about their OEM partners unlike AMD and they also have a good product there, like Lunar Lake is actually very solid and is a performance leader in the area that matters in laptop which is battery life.  >They've been fire selling CPUs and GPUs for years and it's losing them tons of money to the point they've sacked off half of their workforce and are in dire straits begging for subsidies from the US gov just so they can keep their fabs going.  That's only because Pat over-invested, the board didn't want to invest more money, but Pat said it was part of his grand vision and sold it to the board, then halfway through his grand plan the board decided to tell him to leave and go in a different direction. Not to mention, Intel was planned Government subsidies that they didn't receive in time that has affected this whole grand plan of Pat's.  It's not as simple as ""hurr durr, Intel has low prices and low margins and now they're broke"". Even then, Arrow Lake isn't exactly going for a fire sale either in terms of global pricing, in most regions it's hovering at MSRP, it's just that no one has a reason to ""upgrade"" to it because it's trash.  > You are forgetting that Nvidia have a R&D budget far larger than anything AMD or Intel can afford to spend on developing GPUs right now.  You AMD fans always say this inane excuse, yet somehow you also say AMD has slain the Intel giant with 1/20th the R&D. R&D money is great and all but only if you use it wisely as AMD has in CPU and they could replicate that same success in GPU, but they ignore GPU division pretty much entirely.  > If AMD cut RDNA4 prices to bare minimum, how would they afford the even larger budgets for future architectures like UDNA2, UDNA3, etc?  Well AMD is in a unique position because they have more than one product segment to fall back on. NVIDIA lives or dies by GPU, if the GPU they produce is utter garbage and GPUs fall out of favor in the wider market, their entire product portfolio is at risk and their future. AMD on the other hand has CPU to fall back on, consoles and handhelds. Considering how well AMD's CPU division is going right now, they can easily take away some (not all), but some resources from CPU and funnel it into GPU to improve it. So yeah you take low margins for a while, but because your whole company is buoyed by your CPU success, you can afford to do it while you improve the second division.",Negative

Now with all the features expected, the cost of production, and AMD still having to use more expensive nodes/process to compete there is no way AMD can compete on price.  You saw this with how they reacted to RTX 50. They probably assumed they had a nice price set to compete only for NV to come in less than just about everyone expect sending AMD back to the drawing board and the end result was a product that they had to rebate to even honor the price they set. Now, they aren't even shipping in abundance to satisfy demand and thus reduce price.",Negative

AMD,"RDNA4 was already a huge leap in features though. FSR went from subpar vs DLSS 2 from 3.1 to beating DLSS 3 with FSR 4, RT performance significantly improved and is now half way towards matching GeForce vs where they started and FSR Redstone will come eventually for ray reconstruction and whatever equivalents.  Now yeah it's still sorta behind especially before Redstone comes but it's not the massive disparity they had during RDNA1, 2 or 3 anymore. Or what do they need an entire generation for the casuals to get it into their heads that FSR isn't bad vs DLSS anymore?  But I guess AMD has to push hard with RDNA5/UDNA to CLOSE the gap fully or very close to it, and then ideally really have great MSRPs and stick to those prices with good supply or else there'll be another wasted generation of low marketshare where only the console business and iGPUs really justifies continuing the R&D costs of new architectures. But I guess UDNA is supposed to make it so their server and business stuff contributes to gaming dev anyway by unifing them.   I do think RDNA4 could have still been selling well if AMD just produced lots of GPUs at MSRP, and maybe lower the the 9070's MSRP so it's undercutting the 5070. 9060 XT however isn't selling much it seems even though it's probably the best GPU in its price class, guess they needed to price match the 5060 with the 16GB model?

Eventually, when the impact of those actions becomes particularly onerous and painful, there will also typically be much wailing and gnashing of teeth about corporate abuses and so on.

Well I think that's what ARC is, like GeForce and Radeon, it's just going to take some time to get that brand presence.

This correlates with: - JPR Numbers: Show that data collected from distributors reveals the anemic amount of units AMD is shipping. AMD ships 6 units to every 94 NV units. This correlates with the Steam Survey abysmal growth of AMD branded products. - AMD/NV Financial Reports: Show that NV's Gaming section (which only monitors GeForce products, so no Switch/Switch2 inclusion) dwarves AMD's Gaming section (which does include consoles, such as Xbox and it's variants and Playstation and it's variants) to the magnitude that NV's Gaming numbers dwarf AMD's enterprise numbers (that should tell you ALOT).  The end result is 3 data sources that would tell anyone with reading comprehension that there is absolutely no way for AMD to outsell NV outside of niche situations where the vendor is allocating more AMD products than NV, and even that would be a drop in the hat compared to the sheer volume NV floods the market with.  Even if NV only allocates 10% of their shipments to DIY markets, that's still 9 to 6, AMD would have to have 100% sale thru to beat NV only having 66% sale thru, and we all know that isn't happening.

Firstly, that's one retailer in one region. It doesn't prove ANYTHING about whether more RDNA4 shipped than Blackwell. I mean we can just see from Steam HW survey and JPR numbers that NVIDIA shipped way more stock in both Q1 and Q2 than RDNA4. So whilst Microcenter may not have gotten them or even maybe NA was neglected by NVIDIA, NVIDIA still shipped more cards to people on the whole. Again... your whole point was AMD was somehow masterful by delaying their launch so they could build up stock, yet the numbers do not reflect your theory. In Europe for instance there was barely any stock as evidenced by that same video. So AMD only cared to divert stock to NA and made other regions suffer.  Secondly, I wrote a whole lot and you NEVER answered it. So I'll try again. My whole point was you were trying to say that RDNA4 was smart to delay its launch so it could stockpile units, correct? Except that you also then said that there was only 3 weeks left in the quarter so that's why the Q1 RDNA4 numbers were disappointing.  So what is it?:  1. That RDNA4 had high volume and was smart to delay so they could stockpile lots of stock?  2. Or was it that it was an anemic launch that doesn't reflect in Q1 numbers because there was only three weeks left in Q1?  Choose.  > The fake MSRP is easily explained by AMD lying.

AMD simply made out like the MSRP was $599 by giving AIBs grants/kickbacks/allowances (whatever you want to call it) for selling a cheaper model at that MSRP on launch day for a limited run of units.

With woefully inadequate VRM components coupled with nonexistant or extremely weak cooling, those components will get HOT (110C+ tCase). When (not if) those components fail, depending on which ones fail since they are discrete parts, you can totally nuke the load (CPU)",Negative
AMD,modern cpus without a cooler can even boot. they just keep throttling themselves like crazy and takes half an hour to load windows. modern CPUs can also work fine in 100C. The throttling level for many are set at 105/110C.,Negative
AMD,"Asrock admitted fault, but other vendors having the same issue is a deeper problem though and perhaps there is some issue with Zen 5 CPUs.",Negative
AMD,companies dont really give a shit about consumer hardware evidently. its all about cutting corners on cost at every possible opportunity and taking 0 responsibility for whatever happens afterwards. the devs of GMPlib should know better than to run a heavy compute workload on consumer hardware continuously for months on end.,Negative
AMD,"It really is crazy to start a GN video where Steve starts with a almost 10 minute history lesson on some recent examples of AMD's incompetence only for Steve to give three thumbs up in the conclusion!

Nvidia is ruining gaming! Thanks, Steve!  HUB, I don't even think they know how to get into the BIOS.",Negative
AMD,"If they are reporting damage to the LGA they need to include a non-blurry image of the LGA. Any phone from the last 5 years can do that.  Also curious what the failure is. Can the units still POST or are they crashing during workloads?

This seems to suggest a gradual but predictable degradation.""  If they think they found an issue and are broadcasting it publicly they should have receipts / data to support the degradation claim (esp. if they have 10+ of these systems running the same workloads).   Not saying they shouldn't broadcast this, but basically all they said is ""CPU dead"". Hopefully they follow up with more details.",Negative

AMD,but other vendors arent having the same issue. they are having many many times lower amount of issues.,Negative
AMD,">Any phone from the last 5 years can do that.  Very minor counterargument - that's actually not true. Some of the newer phones with 'top' sensors have terrible close-focus capabilities as one of the tradeoffs.

That's the effect that's visible on the image.",Negative
AMD,"When it is a known fact that the failed set ups are using garbage motherboards with overvolted stock settings and an insufficient cooler, it seems stupid to immediately assume the CPU is the problem. Yes the CPU shouldn't damage itself, but also maybe it's not fair to basically set the CPU up for failure in every possible way then blame it when it dies. Imo all 3 components involved here likely share some of the blame",Negative

AMD,"ah, two ASUS motherboards vs 2000 AsRock ones.",Neutral
AMD,First gen ryzen mainly excelled in more heavily multithreaded things lile video editing.   And even on that front it wasnt THAT impressive.

AMD,"Back when it was ok to be 30% slower in gaming,  as long as it was cheap.",Neutral
AMD,A casual video that put into perspective that core count is not the only metric for gaming performances.  Ryzen 7 1800X (OC) vs Core i3 12300 in a few older and more modern titles.  Zen1 was never a great performer to begin with but even with 8 cores it's still way behind a modern 4 cores CPU.,Neutral

AMD,"Shoot i used a 1700 until maybe 1.5 years ago or whatever. IT was a solid CPU, yes it was not the best for gaming, but considering i came from a FX-6300, it might as well have been a Ferrari to my shitty commute car.  I just know that, just like with Nvidia now, i refused to buy Intel because they were so far up their own ass with ego. So yes i took a performance hit, but it was not that bad and i paid a fair bit less than for an i7. NEver regrated it and i built an entirely AMD system 1.5 years ago and its a beast.",Negative

Way, way better than the bulldozer stuff they were putting out before, but still a little bit slower than the Skylake / Kaby-Lake / Coffee-Lake stuff Intel was putting out at the time.   AMD made up for it by having really generous core counts. The single threaded performance was close enough, and the multithreaded performance was impressive.",Positive
AMD,I used a 4th gen i7 for modern games until last year. I'm sure this thing is fine.,Positive
AMD,"Still use my 1700 overclocked to 3.7Ghz daily. It helps that in the few competitive games I play, it's generally enough for me to get over 100 avg frames (with Marvel Rivals being my first regular game where I've really felt how slow my CPU is), and in the story games I do play, usually my 2060 is the limiting factor before my CPU in reaching a steady 60.",Neutral
AMD,and also the price for it... was a huge seller...,Positive
AMD,Yeah. People don't remember how bad the bulldozer family was.  Zen 1 could keep up in multithreading and was behind in single core. Zen 2 was ahead in multithreading and about even in single core. Zen 3 is when they were convincingly in the lead.,Negative
AMD,"The R7 line more or less matched the 6800x while running on $80 motherboards instead of $300 boards and also simultaneously being priced as low as $300 for the CPU (vs $1000)  The R7 line did NOT beat kabylake (e.g. i5 i7 7700k) in gaming overall but was still ""fine"" for people who didn't buy the fastest card on the market for 1080p gaming. It was often practically tied with an OCed 7700k at 4K.  The R5 line swept the floor vs the Kably Lake i5s (e.g. i5 7600k) in productivity. It also beat them in newer/more demanding games (lower frame rate scenarios). It did NOT win in older/high-frame rate esports titles.   My expectation is that in the real world (mid range CPU + mid range CPU), the R5 was generally the better gaming chip.  The R3 (4C/8T) vs i3 (2C/4T) comparison was VERY one sided and the clock speed gap was smaller than with the i7s and most i3 models couldn't be OCed if I recall correctly.   \------  This is at/near launch. AMD was generally (not always) ahead on everything that wasn't 1080p gaming with high performance video cards when comparing the top end parts.     About 6 months later intel upped the core count of their desktop line by 50%. This are up most of the reason to go for Zen 1 and in my view Zen + wasn't a big enough jump.",Neutral
AMD,Also the the R5 1600 was a better buy than 7600k with 4 threads.,Positive
AMD,"Man, I remember when AMD was selling the 8350 over and over and it was just so bad compared to Intel offerings. Huge fan of how they turned it around, I just upgraded my Ryzen 1600 to a 5700x last month on a b350 board.",Positive
AMD,> And even on that front it wasnt THAT impressive.   You could get a $399 1700x (but often cheaper) which basically performed as well or better than the 6800k which was like $1100.  Basically more than twice the perf/$$$. Not THAT impressive smh.,Negative
AMD,Yeah people were so shocked with what AMD had achieved with the Ryzen 1000 series because the FX line was so dogshit haha,Negative
AMD,"I just retired my r7 1800x back in April.   that thing was a monster. Loved it for productivity. Obviously it's showing its age now, but it did 6 years.   First Gen ryzen had snowflakey stuff like faster ram timing very affecting performance.",Positive
AMD,"I mean it's still okay to be slower at gaming if the price is right. Budget CPUs are budget CPUs. Zen 1 never competed with the 7700k well, but eh, you could make an argument for the 1600 and below given how anemic intel's offerings really were.",Neutral

AMD,"Its a fools game to plan for longevity except the extremely obvious. I have a slight preference for IPC over cores based on history, but its hard to know what moment of history you're in. In the early days of Intel 4c era everyone said you should get the 4c/4t part for gaming. And that proved correct for a long time. But if you still had that CPU by the time covid and inflation came around and everything was expensive you were pretty miserable compared to the corresponding 4c/8t part which definitely would last you longer.",Negative
AMD,R7 1700 for 330 was a steal,Neutral
AMD,Then Intel sold skylake for like 9 generations! I’ve been rocking a x470 through 3 different processor generations over 7 years and it’s still just fine for gaming. Intel would change sockets every few years just out of spite before they had real competition. I hope Intel can come back with a strong one soon to keep the rivalry going cause everyone benefits when they are trading blows,Positive
AMD,"Yeah, there were lots of little adjustments to make on the RAM side to get it to run to it's full potential. That said, those 1st gen x370 motherboards have proven themselves. I went from a launch day 1800X to a 5800X. I kinda wish I had sprung for the X3D but I upgraded before the price cut and it was hard to justify at the time.",Neutral

AMD,"R5 1600 for i5 prices was also another steal from zen 1, people may be used to 6 core being the main stream budget option nowadays, but before zen anything over 4 cores forces you to the hedt platform which cost even more on the mb side, not to mention intel 6 cores like the 5820k and 6800k cost around the 400 mark",Neutral
AMD,I remember everyone buying the 1800x which was $500 when all the benchmarks showed the 1700x (and often the 1700 on many workloads) performing like 95% of the 1800x. Never made any sense to me.,Negative
AMD,It was only a steal if you valued the extra cores. Even those only really mattered if you were hosting VMs or rendering really long videos. They didn't really translate in gaming or everyday multitasking. Pretty sure it launched right before the 8700k too and a ton of people were holding out for that CPU. For good reason.,Neutral
AMD,I just swapped to a 5800XT.   I am very much trying to ride til it dies on the am4 platform.,Neutral

AMD,"Yea lol. Also don't forget how suddenly everyone was doing 3D rendering, video encoding, physics sims etc, when in reality 99% of people who bought those's CPU's would rarely, if ever do such tasks. Furthermore, even back then, many of those could be done much quicker using GPU acceleration (i remember using nvidia's hardware video encoder nvenc more than 10y ago already). Nowadays the CPU is becoming even less relevant for those tasks as more and more programs implement GPU acceleration.  And finally the price, the 1800x was around the 500 usd mark wasn't it? A 7700k was 300 or so i think. Yes sure slower in those niche computation tasks, maybe a bit less suited for heavy multitasking, BUT cheaper, faster in almost all games, faster in web browsing and day to day usage.

Of course, the 9070XT also has 33% more SRAM (64MB vs. 48MB), so it’s not exactly a 1:1 comparison, but still… quite impressive.  In any case, I have a feeling things will really heat up on the Radeon side next generation thanks to GDDR7, N3, and the shift to a brand-new architecture (hopefully).

AMD,"Right now the claim is that lower end RDNA5/UDNA will use LPDDR5X on discrete GPUs to get around supply constraints on GDDR memory for GPUs that are in like the 60 tier class.   Now that claim makes no sense to me, because I can't imagine GDDR6 has supply issues with mostly only AMD needing it. But maybe LPDDR5X is cheaper, and with AMD's memory bandwidth, and cache changes, that benefits them somehow. Plus they can use the same silicon on their massive laptop APUs with 128gb to 256gb of RAM next generation. But their architecture and the way they are moving does signal this.",Neutral

AMD,"RDNA4 was itself a new uArch (RDNA3 is GFX11, RDNA4 id GFX12) with relatively few software bugs. Don't think I would expect driver woes at launch, at least with RDNA4 AMD actually showed that driver stability was a key focus and they held back the launch a bit to ensure it.   RDNA5 also looks to be a new uArch, with GFX1250 looking to be CDNA4 instead. So next should be GFX13-based GPUs for consumer grade GPUs.",Neutral

Scheduling is completely overhauled, CU gets a RDNA like rework, massive changes to RT pipeline etc...",Positive
AMD,They better do. They've been coasting since Ampere on a fundamental architectural level. NVIDIA needs a proper redesign and a massive RT increase nextgen if they want to distinguish from RDNA5 and its massive rumoured PT gains.,Neutral

AMD,"No one said this type of compression is new, just that AMD used a newer method for RDNA 4.",Neutral
AMD,I remember the Maxwell (900 series) reviews and the hype was all about compression to improve memory bandwidth as well.,Neutral

Delta color compression was how the ""Tonga/Antigua"" (GCN 3) with a 256-bit wide bus was able to compete with ""Tahiti"" with a 384-bit bus on the original GCN 1 architecture.  And like someone else pointed out, memory compression was how the Maxwell 2.0 got as good as it did, and it was further improved with Pascal (GCN 4 on AMD's side).",Neutral
AMD,"Do those even exist? I’m not believing Samsung until the actually product come out, just like GDDR6W.",Negative
AMD,Not true.   OCing the VRAM has close to zero impact on performance.  SRAM adds a lot of flexibility.  I'd rather them use GDDR6 again and stack 32-64GB I stead of jumping to 7.,Neutral
AMD,"It's not a supply constraint or a cost problem, the rumors simply say the smaller RDNA5 dies will be shared with mobile APUs (Medusa Halo and Medusa ""small"", if that will be a thing). By using lpddr they can also add a lot more memory, if needed.",Neutral
AMD,I can only see GDDR6 supply being a issue if AMD was going to go big on production for their cards.    I somehow doubt that will happen.  They seem fine with playing a very distant 2nd to NV.  The more likely reason to go with LPDDR5x for low end cards is cost.  Its a good enough cheap option which make sense for low end cards.,Negative
AMD,They have to move on from N4 at some point. That node is becoming the next 28nm with how slow everyone is moving off it (AMD and NVIDIA).  RDNA5 isn't releasing until prob +1.5 years from now. By then the CDNA chiplets are probably already on N2 or even A16.,Neutral

AMD,yet in comparable architecture chiplets still result in worse performance as evident by AMDs attempts to use them.,Negative
AMD,"People have been saying this for well over a decade. I still think Intel being a better contender with Druid is more likely. AMD just manages to disappoint in so many ways time and time again but I do think RDNA5 will be modern AMDs best uarch yet, better than gcn1? Time will tell.",Neutral
AMD,"It seems like RDNA5/UDNA has a dramatically different cache hireachy.  The conventional 2/4/6mb L2 cache +32/64/96mb of L3 infinity cache is replaced by a bigger pool of L2  that's smaller than infinity cache and much larger than the old L2  but likely has lower latency than inf cache.  If I had to guess why they did this, it's probably to save on die area allocated to on-die SRAM since scaling for it has collapsed with 5nm.  Having less levels of cache also likely reduces validation time since it's less complex.  AMD is instead likely going to rely on a faster GDDR7 memory and a wider memory bus to make up for the smaller capacity",Neutral
AMD,"the rumoured massive RT gains for RDNA5 would put it on part with 50 series though, so its not like they are eclipsing them. and AMD rumours never turn out to be as good as promised.",Negative
AMD,Yep node and architectural change. They can't do Ada lovelace ++ or Ampere+++ . They have to make fundamental changes to the GPU if they want to keep up with AMDs scalable AT0 monster.,Neutral
AMD,"I do think the wording implies this is some new AMD trick that makes AMD's GDDR6 equal to Nvidia's GDDR7. That only makes sense if we pretend Nvidia doesn't already have aggressive compression, which they’ve had for years. Historically, Nvidia's compression has been better than AMD's as well.  A ""\~25% fabric traffic reduction"" in gaming tests isn't a free +25% to external bandwidth, and it doesn't erase a \~40% raw GB/s gap. Even if we assume AMD just matched or let's even go as far as to say \~10% better than Nvidia's compression, they'd still be well behind on effective bandwidth.  The simpler explanation for those results is that the tested scenarios aren't that bandwidth-bound. Once bandwidth clears a threshold, other limits (shader/geometry/queues, cache behavior, drivers) dominate. So ""RDNA4 compression makes GDDR6 keep up with GDDR7"" overstates the feature by a lot.",Neutral
AMD,"No G6 24Gbps it's still sampling, not in mass production yet.   Doubt that'll happen before GDDR7 3GB becomes widely available.",Negative
AMD,They're not spending that precious die space on more cache.,Neutral

AMD,That he is.,Neutral
AMD,I remember reading about the kyro evil king when it came out.,Neutral
AMD,"A safe iteration how exactly? Pretty much everything across the WGP and outside of it was tweaked in some way. Out of order memory handling, oriented bounding boxes for RT, dynamic register reallocation, the hugely beefed up WMMA capabilities.  You don't get a ~50% performance bump per WGP - about 35% of which being per-clock - with just small iterations.  No, reality is like an other commenter suggested, AMD just held back RDNA4 a little longer whilst they focused on nailing down drivers for a few months. They left a larger gap between mass production and release intentionally compared to RDNA3.",Neutral
AMD,"Sony has a 30B contract.  I bet Microsoft is similar.  Like you said, the word is that they are using UDNA with a focus on Path Tracing performance.  Hoping for 48-64GB VRAM.",Neutral

AMD,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-announces-unified-udna-gpu-architecture-bringing-rdna-and-cdna-together-to-take-on-nvidias-cuda-ecosystem  Isn't the whole point of UDNA to unify RDNA and CDNA into one arch?,Neutral
AMD,"Due to the shitty MCM implementation in RDNA3. They're laying the groundwork for something better but it's reserved for a post RDNA5 as confirmed by the leaked ATx lineup.  It'll probably be a Accelerated interface die acting as a base die (with PHYs, L2 and CP) connecting directly to mem PHYs. This is the workload preparation stage (work items), then these are distributed and load balanced across autonomous shader engines that handle their own scheduling and dispatch. We can call these shader engine dies (SED). This will probably be clusters as one SE is very small, half the size of Zen chiplet rn. On the side AMD has a Media interface die with encode/decode, display, and IO.  Speculation but it's not far fetched, based on CDNA GPU packaging and AMD patents.",Neutral
AMD,"With how far behind Intel are on PPA even with Battlemage, it's probably going to take those 1/2 generations to get to Druid for them to catch up with a product that doesn't actively cause them to bleed cash whilst selling it.   I wouldn't count of a technically competitive Intel GPU product before 2029 at the earliest. Sure it can be competitive on market value if they're willing to continue to sell at a loss, but that doesn't help Intel in the long run that is already very cash strapped.",Negative
AMD,"Kepler\_L2 said L0 and L1 is merged in CDNA4. Maybe RDNA 5 goes even further and merges all CU level caches (including VRF) into one big shared flexible cache like Apple did with M3 and A17 Pro.   Like you said it's about SRAM scaling being bad and minimizing SRAM investment. N3P = no scaling, N5 poor scaling vs N7.      NVIDIA definitely has the advantage here while AMD's cache system is overly complicated and inflexible. The next logical step is to make caches into one big shared block that can be dynamically allocated for different purposes.   L1 will be much more important with the new WGS and ADC scheduling and dispatch within each SE. No more global scheduling only work item preparation and load balancing. This and other methods could explain why L2 will be less important and less used allowing AMD to use 24MB L2 on AT2 (According to MLID and Kepler\_L2 rumours).   Actually the rumour for AT2 is +25% CUs and -25% PHY width vs 9070XT, so perhaps AMD has some novel and forward looking memory saving technology in UDNA. AT2 on paper could easily be stronger than 4090 in raster and that's wild with 24MB L2 and such a weak memory subsystem.  Not expecting anything at AMD FID 2025 but maybe there's a slim chance that they'll share a glimpse into RDNA5. 2027 can't come soon enough.",Neutral
AMD,"Should've worded that differently. All I can say is look at the patents, including the ones Kepler\_L2 shared 3 weeks ago. AMD is matching and exceeding 50 series functionality + tons of scheduling overhaul. If we assume AMD just caught up to 50 series then AMD still has OBB + Dynamic VGPR allocation and Ray instance node transform in HW, NVIDIA doesn't have these rn. But like I said there's so much more in the patent filings going beyond NVIDIA 50 series implementation.  Don't care about the BS MLID PS6 perf PT >5080 or Kepler's RT 2X perf gain per CU.  What will likely happen is that AMD goes 20-30% ahead of Blackwell at iso-raster but NVIDIA cranks PT HW to eleven and more than doubles PT performance at each tier.",Neutral
AMD,"Compression aside, AMD relies on large caches.",Neutral
AMD,I didn't think of that!  And yeah its rumors but its still interesting to think of what they'll do.,Positive
AMD,"Now that NVIDIA has lowered the bar with 50 series drivers, then perhaps AMD can get away with more xD  We'll see.",Neutral
AMD,"Agree with u/Strazdas1 RDNA4 was about adressing a ton of issues in RDNA3 + AMD GCN baggage and obvious issues that needed to be fixed.  Meanwhile RDNA5 will literally change everything. Complete clean slate moment. You're comparing a Terascale -> GCN moment with a major architectural tweak, albeit still no more than a tweak.  NVIDIA has had OoO memory since Turing. WGPR is really cool but AMD wasn't the first to introduce it. Apple has had it since 2023. OBB is nice and actually an AMD first for once but I suspect this is really Cerny's doing more than anything. WMMA is just catching up to NVIDIA 40 series ML HW 2.5 years later.  RDNA4 had a small relatively IPC increase. I did the math months ago. Think it was around 6-8% but not sure. Only exception is 7600 -> 9060XT but that card used RDNA 2 WGP data stores and not the beefed up RDNA 3 stores.  AMD held it back because they wanted to see what NVIDIA priced the cards at, then they didn't invest enough in the driver team + had absurdly low stock at launch so they had to delay the launch.  AMD has not been serious about competiting against NVIDIA since IDK when. where's the prebuilt SIs and OEM contracts? 8% total market share what a joke, if you look at prebuilt vs DIY then it's not good for AMD. They need to increase market share in ALL markets not just some.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, a tweak everywhere to improve on RDNA3 rather than an attempt to make any real improvements. Going the same paths already taken by others and known to work.",Neutral
AMD,...Except better. Forward looking instead of regressive and reactionary. UDNA or whatever AMD ends up calling it is another GCN moment for AMD.,Positive
AMD,AMD never said MI400 is going to use UDNA architecture. I have been following the scene very closely and there's no proof MI400 and RDNA5 will use the same arch.  I believe the unification won't happen in the next generation and it needs more time. Unifying architectures doesn't happen at the snap of fingers. It takes a long time especially when architectures are very different.,Negative
AMD,How do you think RDNA5/UDNA will compare with Xe3? (Design work finished for Xe3 core ip in dec 2024)   More importantly if Intel wants to keep pace with RDNA5/UDNA assuming the WGS and ADC scheduling from the patents makes it into the final uarch then Intel needs to finish the Xe4 core IP in late 2025 or mid 2026 and release products using Xe4 in 2028 or 2029   **Intel vs AMD big APU's**  Nova Lake-AX will use 512 XVE's or 64 Xe3 cores and a mini version will have 256 XVE's or 32Xe3 cores according to rumors. Both of them will compete with RDNA5 48CU Medusa Halo and Medusa Halo Mini  Nova Lake will use Xe3 graphics and the Xe4 media engine (guess the core IP wasn't finished yet),Neutral
AMD,"if the patents you mean are ones you laid out in a few posts you did about it, i think the conclusion we came to was that it would put it on part with Nvidia, but Nvidia isnt going to sleep either so AMD unlikely to eclipse.  Also patent filing and actual product isnt the same thing. A lot of patents never get fully implemented. with AMD we have a history of overpromising rumous and underdelivering releases.",Neutral

AMD,There won't be a unification. The last thing AMD needs is another HPC Vega disaster situation. DC blackwell is entirely different from consumer Blackwell.  It's about merging the fundamental design (ISA + basic blocks) and how the chip cache hierarchy is configured. The rest will be wildly different.,Neutral
AMD,"Kepler\_L2 confirmed it's all in RDNA 5/UDNA. SWC, WGS, ADC, GMD, MID, Local launchers and likely many other yet to be disclosed changes. For RT LSS, DXR 1.2 compliance, DGF and prefiltering nodes, low precision ray/tri intersection, overlap trees and many more HW level changes to RT core in UDNA.   No idea but expect RDNA 5 to leapfrog pretty much everything else. This is another GCN moment for sure. 60 series might hold PT advantage and introduce novel NeRF ASIC block in 3D FF.  But Intel needs to expedite their Xe gen roadmap if they want to stay relevant.     Sounds very interesting. Didn't know Intel will have a mobile GPU targeting high end using LPDDRx as well. Interesting. First Apple, then Qualcomm, AMD, then NVIDIA and now also Intel.",Neutral
AMD,"The new patents changes things quite significantly especially the scheduling changes that align with GPU workgraphs, but that's reserved for games many years into the future (fine wine). Apparently also major cache level changes in RDNA5 so that's another source of potential RT gains.  Conclusion on Spring post was a conservative on par with NVIDIA Blackwell, new patents suggest significantly ahead. Yes indeed and I mentioned that at the bottom of my comment. They can't allow AMD to take the PT crown. Also maybe something insane nextgen like a NeRF ASIC within the geometry pipeline. IIRC NVIDIA had a paper on this a while ago.     That's true but the interesting thing is that if you go even further back IIRC I couldn't find an RT patent that didn't get implemented in RDNA4. So at least for RT patents most of them can reasonably be expected to be implemented in RDNA5. Skeptical about the DMM patents, but everything related to DGF and prefiltering nodes is pretty much a given.  Perhaps this time it's different, we'll see but not fully convinced either. And there is still the possibility that a lot of the patents might be reserved for AMD's nextnextgen.",Neutral
AMD,"Don't think that kind of thing will ever happen again. Designs are already extremely optimized on both ends. Doubt NVIDIA can do another Fermi -> Kepler or Maxwell (not happening) moment, but perhaps they'll surprise us. I could see them pulling a Maxwell moment with PT though. The fundamental core is still Ampere which at is core is still Turing/Volta so a clean slate might happen and that could have massive ramifications similar to AMD's RDNA5/UDNA.  On AMD side let's just hope the architectural changes are massive + AMD's patent derived (unconfirmed) scheduling overhaul is forward looking like GCN Async compute. Prob not relevant for launch and first couple of years. but the other changes can make a massive impact as well.",Neutral
AMD,"There's another patent supporting RDNA5 potentially being amazing if you're interested. Already mentioned it in the post 4 weeks ago, but I understated the impact. Local launchers are very likely to be arriving in each RDNA5 WGP. This will allow them to launch and schedule work and manage ressources on a per WGP basis with a 10x dispatch latency reduction vs the command processor within each shader engine (rn I think).   For workgraphs workloads this will result in insanely high speedups. Ray tracing and procedural code will see massive speedups. Unfortunately think this requires developers to change code like the Workgraphs API. But perhaps AMD can do some magic at the compiler level, but I doubt this. We'll see.  NVIDIA better have something major nextgen or AMD will leap frog them. Repeating myself here but Kepler already called RDNA5 the biggest change since GCN. I don't think that's inaccurate based on the radical patent filings and this probably isn't even exhaustive.",Positive

AMD,Intel needs to pour money and manpower into finishing the Xe4 graphics IP and pulling forward it's release date  Nova Lake-A and AX will use the Xe3 graphics IP (both are expected to release sometime in 2027]  Intel needs to have Xe4 versions of both big APU products ready in 2027 or 2028   **What I think happened**  I think Exist50 was right. Xe3P based Celestial products were likely canceled after the disastrous midyear earning call in 2024  After the unexpectedly huge success of the B580/B670 Intel must've then restarted their DGPU/Large iGPU plans  That's because We're not seeing any DGPU Celestial leaks but we are seeing Nova Lake-A and AX that are supposed to ve ready in 2027  Considering Xe3 will be used in Panther Lake (Q4 2025 and Q1 2026 release) it supports my hypothesis.  **Intel's DGPU future:**  If we don't see DGPU Celestial products in 2026 then either we don't see them or Celestial will be like Battlemage and Intel will have to sell bigger dies that compete with smaller AMD and Nvidia counterparts in 2027 (likely sharing GPU silicon dies with Nova Lake-A and AX)   If they do release a Celestial DGPU then it will likely only be 1 or 2 SKU's that compete on price and are ready in 2027  It will likely be very quickly replaced with Xe4 Druid DGPU's in 2028 which should look more like a proper    AMD/Nvidia  GPU lineup.,Neutral

AMD,I've used Gigabyte boards for years and they've been a bit of a letdown.  Sure they work but their feature set kinda seem like a bit nickel and diming.

It may or may not work out, but I personally think AMD shouldn’t have done things any differently up till this point.",Neutral

If they do this, they will probably integrated it into the SDK, but I absolutely don't expect to be widely adopted.  Also for casual users that thing might prove counter intuative - imagine turning FSR4 in option expecting FPS increase, but in reality you actually lose performance or have just a small bump.  Let's say you play on 60fps (16.6ms) at 1080p. You lower your internal res with this FSR4 version and gain 30% performance. now you are at 78fps (12.8ms). Now add this 2.3ms cost, we are back to 66fps.  But I get it as this is more about image quality rather than performance. You only gain 6fps, but gain better image quality and this will be good, but again, all the caveats and hoops let alone official integration are feeling like big stretch.  Also to ask - is there overhead for the convert/simulation of fp8 to fp16 on top of the 2.3ms or that is the whole cost?",Negative

AMD,"What does 2.3ms spent on upscaling mean in practical terms? I feel as though older AA techniques/implementations would hurt performance at least that much in the first place, and DLSS4/FSR4 seem to me to effectively be the best AA you can get nowadays. I'm vaguely remembering toggling AA on in 2005-2012 games dropping some ~10-20% performance at times, but may be misremembering.  For context, I use DLSS4 myself for two reasons: to make sure I can maintain a solid >=60FPS in some titles, or to drop power draw in other games where I can already achieve very consistent framerates by now rendering a lower base resolution^(1). Can RDNA3 see efficiency gains in this way, or is FSR4 computationally expensive enough in some way on the older architecture that it largely negates the drop in render resolution?  I'd like to give it a try on my HX 370 at some point, but I'm lazy and don't game much nowadays in the first place.

AMD,">You're losing 20% fps to get better image quality vs FSR3.  As I explained in the post, it's not a flat 20%. As framerate increases, the gap between the two increases. If we were talking about a 20% performance difference at like 50fps native, so after upscaling it would be the difference between 60fps and ~75fps sure. But it wouldn't be. If after FSR4 you were averaging 60fps (16.67ms per frame), then with FSR3 you'd be looking at around 66fps (15ms per frame) on average.  The reason why that matters is I'd be a lot more concerned about the performance difference if I were struggling to break 60fps with FSR4. Reality is, the difference in upscaling quality vastly surpasses the difference in performance when both techniques surpass >100fps. Also, with FSR3 I would never tolerate below quality preset at 1440p, because artifacting becomes extremely noticable. Even at the quality preset FSR3 is a clear downgrade from native at 1440p, it's just in the realm of being an ""acceptable compromise"" for me.  For FSR4, honestly even performance preset can resolve things better in some instances than FSR3 quality, even if it's probably not altogether better in terms of image detail. I showed off the ultra quality preset to prove that FSR4 does reasonably well in terms of performance, if I showed off the balanced preset in this scene, performance would be similar to XeSS for better quality still. It would end up looking best no matter how you slice it.  >You're gaining 10% FPS for probably slightly worse image quality vs native with TSR.   Yeah, no. FSR4 at ultra quality preset is hugely overkill for trying to achieve native TSR-like image quality. That bar of ""slightly worse than native"" is where I'd put FSR4 balanced preset at 1440p, not the ultra quality preset. The latter resolves detail much better than native TSR.",Neutral

AMD,"That's a whole lot of strawmen in one post, finishing off with 3 statements that are just very wrong.  The bit about frametimes is dead wrong and that's literally the whole point of this post. It's also not ""image quality similar to DLSS"", it's ""image quality superior to DLSS3"". And lastly, FSR3 upscaling is strictly worse than FSR2.1 upscaling - AMD made pretty significant steps in the wrong direction with regards to image stability.   You know what those frametimes at the end remind me of though? DLSS3 framegen frametimes, where even a 4090 needed to take >3.5ms to run DLSS3 framegen, making the technique that was only useful at higher framerates almost useless when you had high framerates to start off with! And what's worse, FSR FG and XeSS FG are so much better that they visually achieve the same thing with half the  frametime cost! Good thing Nvidia gave up and made DLSS4 less temporally stable than DLSS3, because at least now it's not a total embarassment in terms of frametime cost (although XeSS FG still makes it look terrible).",Negative

AMD,"2.3ms is plenty fast for most use cases. A lot of slower RTX cards spend that much time doing upscaling (from say 1080p -> 4k) with DLSS3 and especially 4. 2.3ms is even fast enough to be useful at high frame rates- i.e, if you have a 8ms render time at 4k native (over 120fps), a 2ms render time at 1080p, then adding a 2.3ms upscale step back to 4k still gives you 232 fps. In practice, your probably going to have other things bottle-necking you more than the 2.3ms upscale time.   Of course, it's even more useful at low FPS. I.e, if you're rendering CP2077 at 4k with RT on at 20fps, turning on upscaling (just with the simple ""1/4th time to render the frame + upscaling time"" naive equation) would give you 67FPS. We pretty much already see that in action with cards like the 4090 getting 15-20fps at native 4k with PT, but hitting 60fps with DLSS performance mode on. At those points, upscaling is less so ""a nice feature"" and more of a hard requirement (and this isn't due to bad optimization- PT is just extremely compute intensive and we need things like upscaling to make it run reasonably).",Neutral

AMD,"That's why it's only technically. It can run it as well as that Punto laps the Nürburgring, but it can do it.  The forward-thinking move by Nvidia was dedicated hardware acceleration IMO. AMD's strategy of using raw compute power on the general shaders for things like AI and RT has its own tradeoffs (area & complexity vs performance) but it quickly boxed them in with things like RDNA3's FSR situation. Nvidia gave themselves a path forward that had much more room to grow, and as a bonus has a longer catalog of hardware that can stay backwards compatible.  AMD just now created that path forward for themselves in RDNA4, so hopefully they stick to it through UDNA so FSR5+ can be usable for these cards as they age. The 9070XT and even 9060XT are going to be plenty of GPU for a lot of people for a long while, so they should get continued support. As RDNA3 and older age out, users of those cards will either continue using work-arounds like this or upgrade to something like UNDA or UDNA2, which is what I plan to do.",Positive

RDNA3 was a significant step up in FP16 throughput, and that throughput is necessary to get usable performance out of FSR4.   But within the RDNA3 stack excluding the small APUs (so Strix Halo, 7600 and 7600XT), FSR4 is definitely perfectly usable.

It might seem scary it first, but once you've done it once, you'll find it's actually a pretty simple process. It's just copy-pasting some files and running a simple script in your terminal, and you can do pretty much whatever combination you like, and even improve the upscaled quality too.

AMD,">I've seen you post a lot about risc-v over ther years. You have been saying 2 years for what 4 years already?  It feels like I've been talking about RISC-V for a long time, because I actually have. Got my first board in 2019 (kendrite k210, a MCU that's based on pre-ratification specs from 2016, OK for user code but not so much supervisor mode / running Linux and such), and also got VisionFive2, the first large-scale SBC, in early 2022. That uses U74 cpu from SiFive, based on the ratified 2019 spec, again 3 years.  I have been consistent, and it has happened consistently: 3 years from core announcement to hardware. Note many IP vendors develop while tracking specs closely, and typically announce their designs shortly after the specs are ratified.  RVA22+V hardware arrived 2024, right on schedule. And RVA23 hardware will be out in 2026, without a doubt, as microarchitecture announcements also happened shortly after spec ratification. And this timeline seems to be on track. A few months ago Tenstorrent presented at a RISC-V conference, and mentioned they were about to tape out the Ascalon design. Ventana commented similarly about Veyron V2 production at scale.  RVA23 has consistently been the target for both Google and Microsoft, thus I will not be surprised when mass market products (such as netbooks or android phones) show up in 2026.  >Risc-V still has a long ways to catch up  The ISA caught up in RVA23. It's not just better than x86-64 (a low bar), but is also no worse than ARMv9, actually doing better in the metrics that matter for an ISA, such as code density or having shorter chains of interdependent instructions (long such chains block superscalar execution). This is with current compilers, not theoretical.  Now it's time for the microarchitectures to shine. The performance promises are there, for the hardware we'll still have to wait for 2026.",Neutral

Then there's the performance issues, granted most of these are due to the way below average linux support, but they are still valid, especially since RV boards are less likely than arm boards to get vendor support and kernel updates (visionfive2 i believe is on the 4 year old end of life 5.15 kernel). Worth noting that most of the benchmarks that make RV boards shine only result in real world performance an entire chip tier below old arm designs.          Then there's the lack of consumer hardware using RV (2 laptop models, probably less than 1000 sold, compared to hundreds of arm models and millions sold.     Then there's the relative lack of users compared to arm.     Then there's a lack of margins compared to arm (for example the main benefit of RV is cost, but the boards aren't cheaper).    Then there's the lack of scale compared to arm.     Admittedly there are some real wins for RV right now, in bringing down costs for manufacturers for routers and IOT devices (this should be bringing them better margins even if they are not being passed down to consumers, but eventually that might change).

AMD,"> Specifically I've been reading about feedback from users; the issues resulting from bad linux support for basic hardware (like ports) seems comparable to arm about 10 years ago.  First mass-produced SBC. Its purpose was precisely to bootstrap all of this, and it did its job.  Debian's RISC-V port is built by a mix of VisionFive 2 and older SiFive development boards using an older version of the same core (U74). It is the third architecture with the most packages built (over 98.5%), close to aarch64 and amd64 (x86-64), and above powerpc.  Driver-wise, most is already upstream in the Linux kernel, only the GPU is missing, and that's solely imatech's (of powervr's fame) fault.  Mine currently functions as my home server, with ZFS root on m2 ssd and another pool on external UASP enclosures. It runs Debian Trixie, with its mainline kernel (a generic kernel not specific to the board). Before this, I used it as a second desktop.  >Then there's the performance issues  U74 is an in-order microarchitecture, a design comparable (but actually smaller and more power-efficient despite faster) to Cortex-A53.

I do believe you got it running on trixie but I would bet some stuff is broken even if you aren't aware of it. A home server has very minimal requirements, and that could have been served similarly by any $10 cortex-a53 sbc.   Though I distinctly remember you saying it was better than cortex-a72 in 2021.   Efficiency is not just a factor of the cortex model, a53 is made on many different nodes, with many different instruction combinations and designed with different power envelopes in mind; there is no one cortex-a53. If it really is more efficient then an a53, then It's kind of surprising we haven't seen it in a single ereader model so far. I'm not sure if you're aware but something like 95% of current ereader models use 4*A53 or 4*a55 cores, while running debian or android.

AMD,"If we all want vanilla, the same flavor, the same performance, then forcing board makers to adhere to AMD's recommendations is fine.  Many enthusiasts are building pcs to tinker with them, to make adjustments to make them a little better a little different.  This is why we have options in bios to make changes.The ""p"" in pc stands for personal, we want to make it ours.  Manufacturers understand this and create products to sell into the enthusiast market to meet this need.  The manufacturers need to be mindful of the risks they take and not go to the extreme of torching cpus and mobos (a la Intel).  The manufacturers are trying to balance performance vs longevity.  In general they do a good job.  The problems with Asrock boards effected a small percentage of boards.  A significant number of boards were impacted to be sure, but still a small percentage.  The estimates I've seen are perhaps 1 to 2%.  Had it been as widespread as some think, 50%+, Asrock would have had to pull their boards immediately because that high a failure rate is unsustainable financially AND it will destroy the brand's credibility.    It is helpful to keep perspective on the magnitude of the problem and why the manufacturers are enticed to take risks.  The board makers are appealing to builders who are looking for competitive advantages.  Sometimes, the engineers fly a little too close to the sun.  This is similar to the problem Nvidia has with the 12vhpwr connectors.   There is no doubt there is a problem, yet the vast majority of 5090 cards run fine with no melting cables.  Most people with Asrock or other boards suffered no failures.  If you were someone whose board/cpu failed, it was a major problem and unacceptable.  I get that.  It is important to keep perspective.  I encourage the designers, engineers, manufacturers to push the envelope to wrest better and better performance from their designs and products.  When they do this we all benefit.  Amd occasionally, mistakes are made.  The test is how people and companies respond to the mistakes.  Will we own our mistakes, make amends, learn from the mistakes and move forward?  Or do we want to prosecute and persecute those that made the mistake?  If companies like Asrock were more forthcoming in publicly owning the mistake, then it might diffuse things.  We are all in this together and need to work together.  Thus endeth today's sermon!",Neutral

AMD,"Definitely agree. Yet it seems complicated when it comes to XMP settings to run RAM above default jedec speeds. Different minimum voltages needed for different memory vendors and specs of the kit, not just the memory voltage but the VSOC voltage for the memory controller on the CPU. A lot of the AMD cpu failures were from mobo makers juicing the VSOC too high to guarantee the memory is stable.  It’s possible to enforce it but a lot of effort needs to go into testing and verifying minimum voltages needed needed on every single board and every single memory kit. And it leads to more product RMAs when just a tiny bit more voltage is needed to make a certain kit stable but the board isn’t giving it. IMO they should be making the effort though. Could cause increased costs but that’s better than ruining reputation frying chips and getting all that bad press.  Not saying the current situation with the mobo vendors is OK, they seem pretty lazy about setting too high voltages, especially for VSOC, when XMP is on, and just calling it fine and shipping it. They could do better. Not to mention straight up bugs and bad code in the UEFI and interface that cause overvoltages even when it *should* have worked fine.",Negative
AMD,I would be okay with a first party motherboard too.,Neutral
AMD,"The problem is most do, until you enable XMP or Expo, at which point the board makers go nuts and start cranking power and voltages to make their board seem artificially better.

Different minimum voltages needed for different memory vendors and specs of the kit, not just the memory voltage but the VSOC voltage for the memory controller on the CPU.

Personally I'd like to see the whole memory ecosystem overhauled, especially now that JEDEC is being more forthcoming in defining frequency specifications with DDR5.   We shouldn't need cruft like XMP/Expo, and the likes of AMD/Intel should be more explicit about what their platforms are capable of, rather than coy statements about ""sweet spots"".",Neutral

AMD,"Easier to just set the SOC voltage to the maximum safe/stable votlage for all RAM tested per CPU family. For example, set the default SOC to 1.3V for Ryzen 9000 CPUs when enabling XMP. 1.3V was the guideline AMD set for the chips. Then overclockers can play with it and undervolt as they see fit. Solves your testing issue and stops boards frying too.",Neutral
AMD,"There's no good solution for all cases, the ""silicon lottery losers"" simply won't work in all cases. It's especially tricky lately as even the old overvoltage solution doesn't cover all cases, as too much voltage can also cause instability, likely with overdriving increasing noise.  However there are incredibly helpful tools and solutions for power users which are either just not presented to users, or usage of them are even presented.  A lot of chip(let) to chip(let) communication is already covered by ECC or at least EDC, and error counters are commonly available, they are just not properly (especially not uniformly) exposed.  For example on modern AMD CPUs, increasing FCLK too high can result in experiencing stuttering, making it highly likely that the IFOP is protected by some EDC. EDC error counters being exposed to users could be helpful with treating errors before they turn into crashing, and they could be also useful for faster and more reliable stability tests.  Then there's that whole ECC memory issue of reliable memory not considered being important for regular users. XMP/EXPO problems would be significantly better if users could look at error counters (even better, getting error notifications) instead of just running long memtest sessions and then hoping for the best.",Negative

AMD,"Intel did actually make desktop motherboards up until about a decade ago - they got into the business to reduce the ""white box junk"" that was being sold around the 386 in order to avoid that having a knock-on effect of tarnishing Intel's brand, and to a lesser extent, box out AMD an Cyrix who were also making competing CPUs at the time.  There's not a lot of money to be made in making desktop motherboards when the vast majority of machines sold nowadays are laptops (and servers), and the vast majority of desktops are OEM desktop models using custom designs.

It does take time to identify the real cause of the problem.  As I said, if a large percentage of boards had been affected, then I believe the response would have been different.  If you were affected by this problem, then it was catastrophic.  I don't dispute that.  There were thousands of other Asrock board owners with 9800x3d chips who were interested but not impacted.  My point is we need to have a balanced perspective.  We can take a zero tolerance attitude and as a consequence we will see prices skyrocket and innovation stifle.",Negative

Even without going into the details of hidden tech info, just consider the much simpler localization problem, users robbed of the opportunity to learn English. The degraded language skills as a result were already visible online several years ago, but I've started seeing more and more non-English posts/comments in otherwise English environments, seemingly with the expectation of others using translators (or does ""new"" Reddit automatically do it?).  Of course there are people who don't even try, but a lot of people learned not by actively seeking out knowledge, but just solving challenges on their way towards a goal. When an Apple phone user (think of all the tablet kids) isn't even allowed to know that files exist, or a gaming console user isn't allowed to run anything not related to gaming on what's essentially a locked down x86 PC, then how are they supposed to learn without even knowing what they are missing out on?  Hell, I'll go as far as claiming that curiosity about technology is even punished, and not even culturally like kids calling you a nerd. Can't even do a lot of tasks on a PC anymore because a lot of services are phone-only, and then it turns out that the phone crapp isn't willing to run on a non-stock OS. Why learn and experiment when anything else than just going with the flow gets you in trouble, and culturally we seem to be in a phase of the majority of the people being okay with everything getting dumbed down, users being expected to just consume without thinking too much?  We had a golden age of computing where people could (and had to) learn quite a bit about technology to get to their goals, and many people could do so with having to learn English first. Nowadays people are funneled towards entertainment/consuming with just a few clicks/taps, and even if anything goes wrong, the technical details are often hidden, only presenting a ""Something went wrong"" or ""Oopsie woopsie"" page.

AMD,the pricing would be my real question as it seems to be too much for both,Neutral
AMD,"they're both overpriced, is this USD?",Negative
AMD,Nah. MSRP is 350. +/-50 is what I'd accept. 100+ more is crazy. That's 30% upcharge.,Neutral
AMD,What country are you in? It would depend on local pricing and what alternatives are priced at. Sometimes countries are just expensive unfortunately,Negative
AMD,usd equivalent of php,Neutral
AMD,where can we get msrp ones im from the philippines.,Neutral
AMD,"if I had to overpay for something, it'd be amd over Intel.  Especially because their new CEO has been threatening to discontinue their GPUs",Negative
AMD,I see. Are the 9060 xt around those price?,Neutral
AMD,thanks for that info ill keep that one in mind,Positive
AMD,on stores here yeah around those price,Neutral
AMD,I see. Then I guess it's fine to buy it. It's a much better card that the b580 by 25%.,Positive
AMD,The RX 9060 XT is just ever so slightly better. Its better at RT and will be more future proof,Positive
AMD,"If you plan to use this card as long as you used the 2060, the 9060 XT is going to be 80-100 USD less due to the power consumption difference.",Neutral
AMD,Remindme! 14 days,Neutral
AMD,"Hey!   I’m in a similar situation, but with the Ryzen 3 3600, and I don’t know how much money I want to invest in the old system before upgrading. Waiting for AM6 looks like a long time. I upgraded the RAM to 32gb at the last PrimeDay.  If you plan to sell the whole system in some time, then choose whatever you like. If you wanna keep the GPU and sell just some of the stuff, then buy the 9060 XT.",Negative
AMD,"Honestly I am not used to using RT because the rtx 2060 almost couldnt handle any game with acceptable framerats when I turned RT on. I am also not a big fan of using DLSS to increase performance because most times everything started looking blurry and a bit jello(?) like.   So you would say that the RX9060 XT is a better choice, instead of buying the RX6800 XT which is on sale right now at 400€",Negative
AMD,I ve used the RTX 2060 SC for about 2.5y now bought it near the end of 2022 on sale from 300€ to 230€.  It was an emergency buy back then when my older GPU moved on.,Neutral
AMD,"Appreciate your thoughts thank you,   I am not thinking about selling the PC anytime soon, I am looking forward to using the CPU for at least 4 more years, after the GPU upgrade the GPU will be used for at least 4y too.   Maybe its the lack of sleep but I couldnt exactly understand your last sentence.",Positive
AMD,Sometime next year a game will release with mandatory RTX and you desperately want to play it (just an estimation). Now you love your past self because you went with the 9060 XT instead of greeding out on a few more fps with the 6800 XT. The 9060 XT will produce less noise and puts less heat on your other components (cpu!).,Positive
AMD,"Yeah, same - need more sleep. lol.   My little fear is always, that the system is outdated soon and the performance lacks. So, I’m trying to think of my future self: would I want to build a new system with the upgraded GPU? (The today-bought GPU would be the oldest, slowest part of the system, so I would try to max it out in the present)  Or would I build a whole new system anyway - and just need a GPU that lasts till, let’s say, 2027.",Neutral
AMD,"I appreciate your insight and taking your time, I ve ordered the 9060xt",Neutral
AMD,"tbh the price difference of the nvidias with better performance are 150€ more expensive and its just not worth it, after reading other members answers on this topic and researching a bit more I ve ordered the 9060xt 16gb.   I understand the fear of  it being outdated possibly soon but this is almost standart with a lot of tech stuff. Honestly I dont think the prices will get better anytime soon and if there is movement for better tech I can still resell the 9060xt for a fair price and wont regret, until then I am pretty sure the 9060xt will serve me for at least 4years.",Negative
AMD,"Intel CPUs of that generation have a question mark over their reliability, specifically possible thermal degradation over time.   Therefore, these Intel chips are so cheap because shops are desperately trying to move their stock. This will impact their resale value in the second-hand market as well so you'll need to keep that factor in mind as well.   I'd probably choose the more expensive Ryzen option for the peace-of-mind, upgradability and future resale value.",Negative
AMD,# 7600X3D,Neutral
AMD,"I think the 7600x3d would warrant the price for the performance alone, then again because Intel will probably require you to upgrade the motherboard if you ever want to in the next generation, but is there a reason why you want the 7600x3d specifically?    If the 7600x3d isn't significantly cheaper for you and you're willing to pay the extra money, you might be better off considering the 7800x3d since it can be found for only $30 more",Neutral
AMD,"I’d recommend a better motherboard if you go with the 14600K, the one you have picked has an incredibly weak VRM setup.",Positive
AMD,"I had the 14th gen K chips and replaced it with a 7600x3d recently (kids and wife are using a 14900k, lol). Performance in gaming is about the same at 1440p and above. The other stuff I do, Intel is better and the 14600k is a screaming deal. I’d take the savings and get a better gpu.",Positive
AMD,"7600X3D is slightly better in gaming, while 14600K wins in productivity by a lot.",Positive
AMD,"If you decide to go with the 14600k, which I have by the way, make sure you do the bios updates for your board first thing, that is all and you will be good. Also, if ya do go with the 14600k you should for sure go with a better motherboard bro, no point in getting a K skew chip of ya not getting a Z790 Board. The board u mention  ya may aswell get a non K skew chip, the K skews are the better overclockable cpus and that board you have on there is not good man. Your getting a beast of a cpu and putting it with a dogshat motherboard... I understand budget is a thing but ya, no point getting the k skew if ya getting that board. Z790 board for sure or change the cpu to non K.",Neutral
AMD,[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/B9OmKHTqBMQ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/B9OmKHTqBMQ)  this video sums it up perfectly imo  7600x3d = better upgradability but the 14600k can be a great option still,Positive
AMD,"If you’re just gaming, 7600x3d. If you’re doing productivity stuff, 14600k",Neutral
AMD,"The 14600k is a beast of a chip. The only downside that it can be a little hot, but your AiO can handle it easily. You probably will not have to upgrade your chip in the next 4-5 years or so at 1440p (GPU will be the thing you'll need to upgrade first). So don't worry about ""upgrade path"", or resale value.   At that price difference, I'd get the 14600k. AMD chips are good, but they've been a little bit overpriced right now (following the same footsteps of Intel in the past).  Yes. Downvote me, AMD fanboys. You guys are ignoring the fact that AMD has become a luxury brand, and are suggesting something almost 2x the price for very similar performance (or even worse in normal usage).",Positive
AMD,Intel by far...,Neutral
AMD,The 7800x3d is about €50 more expensive. But I think that one is a bit overkill for the rx9060xt.,Negative
AMD,"If he gets either of these rigs tho, he won't need to upgrade for years. That PC will be fine in 5 years easy.",Positive
AMD,"Yes, if going with an dead socket, live a little and get a nice motherboard at a discount. Deals are out there. Though not everyone likes used, so YMMV with new LGA 1700",Positive
AMD,That is a interesting point. I could upgrade the 9060xt to a rx5070 for about the same money,Positive
AMD,But is it €130 more better than the Intel one?,Positive
AMD,Normaly i would agree with you. But not if the non-k version is 2* as expensive.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah.. not sure why you're getting mass downvoted.  The 14600K is only $150 right now via Newegg and comes with BF6 for ""free"".  **Effectively $80 for the CPU itself assuming you were planning on buying the game at launch.**  Considering he's playing on 1440p, the FPS difference won't really be super high unless its some CPU bound esports game or ms flight sim.  This is obvious due to cache.  People might argue AM5 upgradability, but this only makes sense if you're planning on keeping a platform for like 5+ years.  Selling off the mobo and CPU every 2-3 years is more logical IMO.  The 14600K performs a little better than the current AMD 8 core single CCD's ATM for MT related stuff.  I wouldn't exactly look at this like a 6 core CPU.. It's generally competitive with a 12900K due to clock/ring speed differences, minus some MT performance being left off the table.  There's nothing wrong with AMD, but if OP is planning on buying BF6.. it's kind of a no brainer to go 14600K with a half decent board.   He should be able to net min $200\~ in the next few years when he wants to upgrade.  Power draw in most games is actually within 40W of each other when left stock... Only outlier is likely battlefield where the game will leverage a full CPU and draw like 150W max.. but it's really only this game engine.  I'll go against the grain a little.. I don't think this CPU runs hot.. at least relative to the 8+8 alder/raptor configs.. which tend to hit 100C pretty easily.  Edit: just realized hes in Europe. Changes some aspects, but it will generally come down to price still.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, this sub hates Intel lol. I have used AMD for the last 5 years, but there is a certain price where getting 5 years on a 14600k is worth it. $100 after selling BF6 is pretty damn close to that price!   I also love how everyone parrots ""spend more - who cares how much, because you can upgrade on the same socket and save a few dollars!"" Like bro, save the money up front instead, get a great performer now, and just upgrade when you need it. It comes out to similar cost in the end, since everything will be cheaper (ie cost / frame) in 5 years. If you need to upgrade sooner than that, you probably made compromises in your initial CPU choice, or you are an enthusiast and wouldn't be making this post.    As I prepare for the downvotes, I will add I feel good about 14600k, but not 14700k or higher. At that point I would just get AMD. I might go AMD anyways, but for anyone who wants to save money up front or wants the best deal, 14600k rips",Negative
AMD,100% 14900kf is cheaper than 9800x3d rn.,Neutral
AMD,You might find this video interesting … compares a lot of CPUs performance with the 9060 XT.  https://youtu.be/NqRTVzk2PXs?si=bbn7bpSd1jHb9Bgz,Positive
AMD,For 50bucks it is well worth it to upgrade.,Positive
AMD,"I'm actually surprised you saw the 7600x3d for a good price because that was a limited-run CPU with limited stock.    I think you can go as low as the AMD Ryzen 5 7600x and it would be JUST good enough for the 9060xt if you're on a strict budget. You should be able to find the Ryzen 5 9600x for about the same price and that should beat the Intel i5-14600k in most games, assuming you won't need the multi-thread performance for anything like video editing or rendering",Neutral
AMD,"I'd recommend going with AMD just so you aren't hard locked into the Intel upgrade path, and then because AMD uses much less power and takes less investment to keep cool.    I think both the 7600x3d and the 7800x3d would give you all the performance you want and then some for the future, but if you don't want to pay extra and still want better gaming-specific performance there's still the 9600x",Positive
AMD,"I was actually thinking of just around 8 years and that they might want to do plan upgrade just before the end of plantform life cycle in prices do a repeat of this generation, but I just fired up my crappy laptop with integrated graphics and it looks like everything I was playing was optimized just enough to get a playable experience where I wasn't happy with the Ole Xbox before.   They definitely should be good and it sounds like Intel was the much better deal for them",Positive
AMD,Unfortunatly second hand mobo in the EU market is not as big as in the US. What micro-atx board would you recommend?,Neutral
AMD,That's a subjective thing to say. There's plenty benchmarks on youtube pitting both CPUs against each other. Just check their comparative performance at the resolution applicable to you and make a decision :),Neutral
AMD,"The Intel was at the moment of writing about €130. Now back to €145. Still good. (no free bf6 sadly). My last few pc's i've kept about 8 years, that has been about the point when there are a few titels that get me to upgrade. This time it was bf6 with their stupid anti cheat haha...  An other redditor had the idea to put the €130 in a better gpu instead of a cpu, that would be a upgrade to a rx5070.",Positive
AMD,"Because in the last few years, people have become AMD fanboys (with good reasons). They have forsaken all logic and just immediately go ""intel sucks, buy AMD"".  Intel has been reducing their pricing by a lot and many of their chips, especially in the budget range, are now way better choices than AMD counterparts.",Negative
AMD,"Where I live the 265K costs literally 30% less than a 9700X and people here are still recommending AMD cuz ""dead socket"" as if anyone is gonna need to upgrade a 265K for 1440p gaming before AM6 comes out.",Negative

AMD,"Can you check eBay? I'm not sure what's available to you, but get something that has a little more than what you need for features, and probably get something that you think looks nice and has a built in io shield. Usually those models have better VRMs. If you don't know what that is, just get something that looks heavy haha.    If you can't find a good motherboard at a good price, don't bother with 14600k and go AM5.",Neutral
AMD,"Ah yeah.. that's a tad more competitive and I can see both CPU's being valid in this case.  Like I said, unless a game is super CPU bound, they're competitive fps wise give or take up to \~40w in most games.  I would view it this way.. If you play competitive games (low res, optimal settings) and want a long term platform, then maybe AMD makes more sense here.  I view the 14600K as the better ""all arounder"" atm (better productivity/streaming), but it does lack in specific situations.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, a gpu upgrade will do you much more than cpu (and the 7600x3d is not even better than the 14600k in most games at 1440p)",Neutral
AMD,"The only argument that's valid to me is esports gamers. There are situations where running an    X3D just nets much higher FPS, especially on low res.     1440P and high graphics? More than not, these two CPU's are quite close... bar the intel chip running slightly more wattage at lower res.     I've been building PC's since 2002ish and socket longevity never really mattered. People would always hover to the price to performance option on the latest release.",Neutral
AMD,"The price range is between us is bigger than i thought. The best price for the 14600k shows as $165 for me, while the 9600x is $189, but I could've sworn I saw it recently for $10 or $20 less   I was actually trying to watch the 7600x3d to see if it ever comes back in stock and I gave up when I saw $450 when the 7800x3d dipped close to $300, but the 7600x3d is now showing as $310 for me. I wanted to help and even made another list to make sure it stays in your price range, but the range is too much 😭",Neutral
AMD,Could you share the list you made? With conversion a lot of the prices get pretty close. I could look up the build you made and see what it would have cost here.   14600k: $165 = €140 - eu price €139 9600x: $189 = €161 - eu price €196 7800x3d: $410 = €383 - eu price €316 7600x3d: $310 = €264 - eu price €273,Neutral

AMD,"Why?  Just because you had a board go bad doesn't mean the same thing is going to happen to the next one.   Just make sure to update the BIOS on the new board if its an older version, enable Memory Context Restore, Power Down Enable, and set EXPO and you're set.",Negative
AMD,"It's just rma process will take many weeks and I am not sure how easy is the process in India. It will take some time to convince them and when they will be fixing, I want to use my pc.

AMD,"RMA process is mailing it to Taiwan, they verify its covered under warranty and send you a replacement if its covered. Otherwise they'll deny warranty and send it back to you or offer to repair it anyway but they will charge you for it.   Unless your mail service is inefficient, at most you'll be waiting 10-14 days for the whole process.

AMD,3500x doesn't have hyperthreading which kind of sucks. So it's 6 threads vs 12 on the 3600.,Negative
AMD,Huperthreading can matter depending on the game. Many games benefit from more than 6 threads. Many games however do not. You'd want to look at the games you play to make that decision. Source engine games will not benefit. what are you playing/etc? Are you having issues with performance or just want to upgrade? It may be better to wait for the 5500 or 5600 to lower in price and upgrade to that.,Neutral
AMD,Personally maybe an AMD Ryzen 5 4500. Idk about your country but where I live it cost 54€,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah but the 3600 is quite a bit more expensive. second hand is near impossible to find & new is $88, quite a bit over the budget",Negative

AMD,"Good looking build! Why the 2TB and 512 drives? I bet you could just grab a 4TB m.2 for a similar price!  Also, when you’re playing the mental games trying to find out how to get a deal, *never* save your money in the PSU department.",Positive
AMD,That is a solid build. Just make a test bench to test the components before the final assembly. Try to install your os before you put it in your case. That will save you a lot of time. I did that when I built my PC and it took about 6 hours in test bench phase. Everything has to be install and the ram check.,Positive
AMD,Thanks! I'll try to watch some of his vids!,Positive
AMD,I was trying to separate my OS and put it on the 512 drive. Also do I need to change my PSU or is it okay already?,Neutral
AMD,"Just grab a thumb drive and have an OS backup on it I case you need to reinstall windows for some reason!   And as it stands, you PSU should be good to go. Just avoid discount brands/ratings for your PSU.",Neutral
AMD,Try and get on am5 if possible with ddr5 ram (Ryzen 7600x or 9700x etc) its gonna be worth it in the long run   Other than that its a decent build,Positive
AMD,"Can you make a pcpartpicker list with these parts to ensure compatibility, the best deals, and for ease of tracking? You have a lot of really old parts on this list and sometimes old stock costs 2x the new product because they know uninformed buyers will buy it.

AMD,"You should instead consider building on the AM5 platform since youre gonna be using davinci resolve, you will benefit from ddr5. Also, dont get a motherboard that starts in A, B650 and B850 are best for am5, B550 for am4. And dont underspend on a psu, go for 750w.

AMD,"If I was choosing between 5060, 4060 and 9060 XT, I would've gone for the 9060 XT as well.  For me personally the choice is simple - I can't stand frame generation, and I prefer minimal upscaling. With that, the 9060 XT's raw power wins even considering its slightly weaker RT performance.  Also, from just purely my memory - AMD's driver CPU overhead is lower than NVidias, at least currently. AMD is also well known for their GPUs aging like fine wine - driver updates increasing performance over time.  FYI - I am saying this as a 4070 owner (and a long term nvidia user overall).",Neutral

AMD,"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Founders Edition at $999  If you ordered it, you can afford it and it is 3rd fastest consumer GPU considering you are basically running in between 1440p and 4K.",Neutral
AMD,5080 or get a 5070Ti. 7900XTX is a good card if you ALREADY have one. but i wouldn’t buy it new,Positive
AMD,5080 FE Obviously.,Neutral
AMD,Don't get the xtx. Upscaling is the future and the xtx has horrible upscaling.,Negative
AMD,"Do you play 20+ hours a week of VRchat using a VR headset?   If not, go with a 5080.",Neutral
AMD,"7900xtx. Its a great card, much cheaper, and you dont have to keep giving into Nvidias price gouging.  Like $1000 for one of their gpus when you can get almost all of the performance from a 7900xtx for way less",Positive
AMD,5070ti or 9070XT.,Neutral
AMD,"Just received my new PC  Specs:  Ryzen 7800x3d  Radeon 9070XT (gigabyte gaming oc)  32 ram  2tb ssd  So it looks pretty similar to your build.  Switching from i7 11700 and rtx3080 10gb, I can see the performance boost in many games  9070xt was about 250$ cheaper than 5070ti in my country  Will see how the 7800x3d performs on Ubuntu/Fedora for work  Long story short, I'd rather recommend considering 9070xt instead of 7900XTX",Positive
AMD,"People are saying 5070ti, but 5080 with a 5-6 year upgrade cycle imo. You won't miss the little extra spent (comes out to like $50 a year) and the minor improvement over the others can make a big difference towards the end of the life of the card especially with framegen really wanting 60fps base.",Positive
AMD,Yeah it's really hard to recommend RDNA3 or older at this point with the poor upscaling and poor RT. An XTX would have to be like $600 or cheaper for me to even think about recommending it. It's going to age so poorly compared to RDNA4 or any decent Nvidia GPU from the last few years.,Negative
AMD,Why,Neutral
AMD,"I was originally looking at the 5070 Ti MSI Trio at $849, but then considered the 5080 FE at MSRP. Now, after the BF6 announcement that it won’t use Frame Generation, I’m wondering if I really need all the extra features of the 5080. With the $300 difference, would it make more sense to go for the 7900 XTX at $699 instead for my games (WoW, LoL, BF6) and my 3440×1440 ultrawide setup?",Neutral
AMD,"I barely play wow 😅, but will keep the 5080, ty!",Positive
AMD,9070xt and 5070ti are both better cards that will last longer than the 7900xtx for barely more money,Positive
AMD,"Honestly as it stands right now the XTX is perfectly capable of running almost anything without any need of FSR, I can't think of a single title where it has struggled natively especially at 1440p, now of course the 5080 will age much better with DLSS and the more impressive RT but honestly if RT is not a concern then the XTX will be fine for another 4 or so years.",Positive
AMD,Because pre-FSR4 AMD upscalers are bad. And even with the top line GPU you will be pushed to use it. Even if you think for now that it won't happen.,Negative
AMD,"Because FSR3 is a blurry shit. Here, real life comparison, just look at first 10 seconds and you see it's a night and day pretty much:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZU0\_ZVZtOA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZU0_ZVZtOA)  If you are not planning to upgrade in many years then you will need to use upscaling at some point. And FSR4 looks okay, DLSS4 looks decent... but FSR3 is crap that results in artifacting and blur all over the place.  And unlike Nvidia which supports DLSS4 just fine on 30/40 series you can't use FSR4 on older cards.",Negative
AMD,"i mean all of them will run great, maybe bf wont exceed 150fps at max setting for the xtx but 50series feature are nice to have, especially if u are not planning to upgrade soon",Positive
AMD,"Hey, sorry to derail, but what was this news about frame generation with BF6? I tried googling but couldn’t find what you are talking about!",Neutral
AMD,"Think of frame generation as future proofing. You don't need it for anything now sure, but in 4 or 5 years when that rig isn't maxing everything out no problem like it is today, instead of buying a new card or building a new rig you can try switching on frame Gen and maybe get another handfull of years out of it. I'm sure this new tech will be more prevalent in games 5 years from now than it is with today's titles.",Neutral
AMD,"I got a 5070 ti and don't regret it, even tried some 4k games in my tv with dlss. Can't wait to play BF6 Ultra Wide 3440x1440 with it, I had the 4060ti during the beta and it was already good getting around 90fps at performance preset without dlss. I also have a 9800X3D so it helps a LOT. If you can get a 5080 go for it but if you want to get the cheaper one go for the 5070 ti, you can overclock and undervolt to get more performance.",Positive
AMD,"I played the battlefield beta on my 7900xtx + 13900kf rig and it performed beautifully. I also play games like Helldivers, Gears of war, Total War: Warhammer 3, Silent Hill 2 remake, etc and I have not been disappointed in any of these games. I never use any of the upscaling features and typically play on High/Ultra settings. The 7900xtx is a very capable card. It has served me dutifully since 2023. Even going into the future, if you’re willing to play games at medium/high settings in the future the card will serve you well. Plus the 24gbs of VRAM is very nice.   I also play all my games at 1440p.",Positive
AMD,"You need FSR4/DLSS for BF6, it’s unplayable blurry mess without them",Neutral
AMD,9070xt is better if you intend to raytrace.i definitely wouldnt pick Nvidia either way.,Neutral
AMD,"I use fsr 2 and 3, and they're good to me",Positive
AMD,For the life of me I cannot tell the difference between these two videos,Negative
AMD,"My bad, just checked and it’s “no ray tracing” I thought it was the same 😅",Negative
AMD,No you don’t. Beta ran fine. What are you playing on?,Neutral
AMD,They can sometimes be slightly usable. But fsr 4 is magic compared to them,Neutral
AMD,"Load it at 1080p at least and look at the fur. In FSR3 it glitches out as it moves, has weird sharp edges etc. In FSR4 image is stable/consistent.  Similar thing occurs here:  [https://youtu.be/EZU0\_ZVZtOA?t=553](https://youtu.be/EZU0_ZVZtOA?t=553)  Tree in FSR3 is glitchy, blurry and unstable. With FSR4 it finally mostly stops shimmering.  Or if you want screenshot format:  [https://gamersnexus.net/gpus/amd-fake-frame-image-quality-afmf-fsr-4-vs-fsr-31-comparison](https://gamersnexus.net/gpus/amd-fake-frame-image-quality-afmf-fsr-4-vs-fsr-31-comparison)",Neutral
AMD,"Most people never use it or RT. If you are playing purely solo games and like to stop and look at puddles, maybe. If you are playing something fast paced or fps games. You won’t notice.  Recently some games have decided to not include support for FSR/RT. (I.e. BF6)  I’ve got 2 rigs with a 4080 and a Saphire 7900xtx. Both run great and I’ve never turned on the frame functions.",Neutral
AMD,"Haha, all good! Getting rid of DLSS on BF6 would be a pretty terrible move so I was a little worried that I had missed some crazy news 😂",Negative
AMD,"Who said anything about fps? I’m talking about default TAA, which looks simply awful. Game was almost unplayable with “No DLSS” bug that happened during week 2. I was forced to use DLDSR to fix it",Negative
AMD,Omg! Those fsr3 pictures are how my current 7900xt (that I’m also returning) looks like 😫 and I hate it! I thought it was my monitor!,Negative
AMD,Okay I can see it in this one thanks. I don't think I would be personally bothered by this when gaming but I can see how it would be annoying to others,Neutral
AMD,With any half decent GPU you won't need to upscale at 1080p,Neutral
AMD,"you still need FSRAA or DLAA at 1080, because TAA at 1080p is absolutely awful",Negative
AMD,I always read this argument.   You know what looks absolutely great and not blurry at all?  FSR4 at native. You don't have to use the upscaling if you don't want to.   I play 1440p with my 9070xt and just run native res with FSR4 enabled.,Positive
AMD,Really depends on the games TAA implementation but yeah fair I guess,Neutral
AMD,"When it comes to overclocking, the hardware you choose plays a big role as well.   When motherboard manufacturers make motherboards, they design a plain reference board and then they tweak it slightly to make lots of variations.   2 slot RAM boards are a bit extreme - they're often either the absolute worst lowest quality or top notch.   4 slots really isn't technically needed, and even at a technical level actually harms signal and overclocking potential.   But 4 slot boards tend to be mid-high quality, especially if you can find a 6+ layered PCB one.   I've seen 6000 RAM fail to work properly on many 2-slot cheapo 4-layer AM5 boards.",Negative
AMD,"Then the problem here is the motherboard, right?",Neutral
AMD,"I like the 9700x but at that price I'd probably just get the 9600x, also I'd just stick to the 9070 XT  EDIT: alternatively, you can get a 9700x on Aliexpress for cheaper",Neutral
AMD,"https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/Q3zLQd  Roughly same budget, you get the 5070 Ti but with a more power hungry CPU for base speed being better than the 9700x",Neutral
AMD,Think x3d is more than slightly better but I haven't checked benchmarks. It has 3 times the cache,Neutral
AMD,"In regards to the CPU and power efficiency, don't look at the power levels as stated on the box - they're inaccurate at best and just wrong.  Under gaming loads, the 7800X3D is much more efficient than the 9700X (though the 9700X has a 65w rating; the 7800X3D 120w).  See [these power measurements from Techpowerup](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d/23.html) \- under gaming loads, the 7800X3D is drawing 50-60% less power than the 9700X.  The 7800X3D is objectively the much more power efficient CPU during what would be your primary usage.  Many of the parts in your list seem expensive, as there are less expensive alternatives.  Suggestions below that upgrade the CPU to a 7800X3D and the GPU to a 5070 Ti, plus some other improvements (including being more power efficient) for €3 less.  * **CPU**:  Upgraded to the 7800X3D for better gaming performance with less power draw. * **CPU Cooler**:  Less expensive listing at Amazon Germany of the better Phantom Spirit. * **Motherboard**:  Less expensive B650 with wifi and bluetooth. * **Memory**:  Less expensive same spec RAM. * **Storage**:  No benefit to paying a premium for the 990 Pro for games.  Switched to a much less expensive still good spec 2TB PCie 4 NVME. * **Video Card**:  While the 5070 Ti is more expensive, it provides [a little better performance](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-radeon-rx-9070-xt-pulse/32.html) and [draws less power](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/sapphire-radeon-rx-9070-xt-pulse/41.html). * **Power Supply**:  Less expensive just as good quality 850w ATX 3.1 unit (having a higher rated wattage, it should be slightly more power efficient when the pc is under load, as it will be nearer to 50% draw). * **Case Fan**:  Added a 120mm PWM case fan for exhaust at the rear to help with airflow. * **Monitor**:  The Asus are expensive/overpriced.  The Samsung have the same specs (resolution, refresh rate, max brightness) for far less cost.

AMD,I was also thinking about the 9600x.  But I felt like going with 8 cores might be worth it in the long run.,Positive
AMD,Thanks for the suggestions! Looks like a really good alternative :),Positive
AMD,Thanks of the input! I will look into the power draw more. But generally looks like a good alternative. I must admit the monitors where a bit of a placeholder and i didnt look into it in more detail yet.,Positive
AMD,"If you're comfortable with getting one from Aliexpress, then I'd recommend buying it there. With coupons and price adjustments, you can find one for as low as 190 euros. Of course, Aliexpress has its risks, so if you plan on ordering, make sure to check the ratings, number sold, and reviews, especially the ones with pictures and the negative ones. Keep in mind there’s also no warranty  Personally, my baseline before even checking reviews is >2k sold and a rating of at least 4.7  The reason I’m recommending it is because I got my 9700x from Aliexpress and it works fine in my build",Positive
AMD,Good luck with your build,Positive
AMD,If the reviews are good go for it. Just understand you could be screwed depending on what the exact tariff situation is atm.   Ive bought both a 5700X3D and 7500F from Ali Express to be delivered to the UK and had no issues.    Go for a decent seller though.,Neutral
AMD,"Yea it's probably fine, I paid $225 AUD for mine and it was all good.   As long as they have lots of sales and good reviews you should be fine.",Positive
AMD,If it is legit it's probably a tray CPU. It will have no warranty.,Neutral
AMD,"You can buy the product if it has good reviews and sales. You can also use discount coupons.

AMD,do you know the seller name?,Neutral
AMD,i asked the seller and he said that this cpu has 3 years warranty,Neutral
AMD,Then go for it if the price is good. Just make sure to pile on any coupons that are available. Iceberg Tech is a youtuber ive grabbed codes off before.,Positive
AMD,"Unfortunately the price isn't the same anymore, they change very fast",Negative
AMD,Well if you gaming at 1080p 120hz a low end modern card is plenty for older triple a titles or lower demanding newer games. Example 5060ti 16 gb ver or 9060xt 16gb ver. What games are you looking to play?,Neutral
AMD,"For now, just The Witcher 3, but I want something that can also handle The Witcher 4 and ""*The Blood of Dawnwalker""* when they come out. (I also play some smaller games like *Gatekeeper* or *Cult of the Lamb*, stuff like that)",Neutral
AMD,If your games ran fine on 2gb vram I'd say a 9060 xt 8 gb would have enough vram for you now but might not be enough for Witcher 4. I wouldn't recommend Nvidia because of their CPU overhead since you're on a r5 7600,Neutral
AMD,Ok ok i see ! Thank you so much !,Positive

I never bought a Titan since the value over the highest non-Titan cards were abysmal, but otherwise I've always been nuts with GPUs since the Diamond Monster Voodoo 1.  But I always sold my cards, at least from 2 gens back, to buy the latest.  Can't believe you had No GF3 Ti 500 or Ti 4600?  Also more than one of the crappy 5000 vacuum series Nvidia cards?  That was the time to just go ATI.  I'm not a collector myself, but a decent trip down memory lane.",Negative

AMD,Please make plans to ensure these go to an actual museum before you die. Imagine the estate sale and they are trying to yardsale these to pennies for some grandma to smash and make computer themed mobiles for toddlers or something.  Tragic thought.

AMD,"Damn I thought my first GPU was a Geforce 3 TI 500, but now I see that's an AGP card.

AMD,I can't remember the model.. Do you have the first 64 mb GPU from ATI?  I had one as a kid and it was really interesting.  Was right before direct3d/opengl really took off so it did not have great game support but it was actually two 32mb cards grafted together.    You could actually turn off half your GPU for compatibility with old games.,Positive

At that time (early 2000's, sometimes before 2005 I think), Radeon 8500LE was the strongest ATI card, and nVidia had the monster 4600Ti (and more price friendly 4200Ti and 4400Ti which where miles ahead of 8500LE). Then, all of a sudden, ATI comes up with 9700Pro and blasts all the nVidia cards into oblivion. After that, next few years nVidia struggled with keeping up with ATI as their FX cards came with loud fans (those turbines) and marginally better performance if any at all. This was the best time for ATI to keep the crown and continue, but then they got lazy and nVidia got back on track with GTX cards.",Neutral

AMD,"I'd go with the AMD AM5 socket option. Cheaper upgrade option in the future due to not needing a new motherboard, and it avoids the risk of Intel's degradation issues. There are BIOS update fixes for it, but the degradation isn't just a software issue, it's also a physical design defect/flaw. So I don't trust that a BIOS update resolves the issue good enough to prevent the CPU from still degrading after a few years.  Also the AMD CPU is more power efficient so it may have a long term effect on the power bill and will be easier to keep cool.",Neutral
AMD,Okay so reading all of the comments this is what looks probable for now [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) (CPU and GPU from MicroCenter)  I havent inlcuded MC bundle here because 9700x bundle doesnt come with microatx motherboard so i will have to go and ask if i can switch the motherboard with something else but other than that this is how its looking right now.,Neutral
AMD,isn't 7800x3D around same price as 9700x? Intel is okay but I would pick 9700x otherwise if bundle does save you money.,Neutral
AMD,how about performance difference tho? i looked around and it looked like 14600k was more powerful. not sure how correct that is tho,Neutral
AMD,"It depends on whether your production apps can leverage the E-cores effectively. If they can the 14600k will be faster, though whether that makes up for the reliability problems and dead platform would depend on if you really need your school projects to compile 20% faster.   For gaming the performance difference between the two is much smaller as games don't effectively use the E-cores and probably not hugely relevant given what GPUs you could get on a $1400 budget for the entire system.",Neutral
AMD,Yep I have a 9700x and 9070xt and my submission showed both AMD Radeon(TM) Graphic and AMD Radeon Graphics.,Neutral
AMD,FYI this has been a known bug with steam where 9000 cards will report as generic amd,Negative
AMD,So AMD hilariously failed to provide proper identification for their product in the most important platform their user base and potential customers use?,Neutral
AMD,"Something worth mentioning is that the 9070 XT does show up under Linux, likely meaning that Linux drivers are correctly reporting the 9070 XT. There, it makes up 1.05%.   We can't directly correlate these numbers, as Linux users are likely to build their own systems, and generally prefer AMD over Nvidia, unlike Windows users, who predominantly buy prebuilts/gaming laptops and prefer Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Eh, that doesn't really make sense as an answer either, those two generic listings aren't trending up like you'd expect with a newer GPU. They're going down or sideways.  It's possible they're lumped in there but those don't specifically represent RDNA4 GPUs.  They're reported properly as 9070/9070 XT/9060 XT if you look at systems running Linux specifically but that's an entire different can of worms as a variable.",Negative
AMD,"That often happens when an iGPU is active and it can happen no matter what your gpu is. Steam doesn't ignore rx9000's specifically from the survey. Check gpu's compared by supoorted directX version. You'll find 9070 in dx12 category. And considering other reports about supply, sales & profits of GPU's of Radeon and nVidia in Q2 25, I think the steam survey result is not completely wrong.",Neutral
AMD,My 9070 XT shows as such in the Steam survey. Why is that then?,Neutral
AMD,"Those are IGPU and integrated graphics, if you look under linux you can find the 9070 at 0.15%, the fact that this conspiration theory has 1824 upvotes is shocking, we just had an official quarter report from both Nvidia and JPR and shows amd at 6% market share.   Those cards did not sell well period. You can find a steam survey from last year and compare the numbers on those two supposed sections, their numbers have increase marginally.",Negative
AMD,The Steam survey has always been vague but with the new JPR sales report Nvidia now has 94% of the consumer AIB market,Neutral
AMD,There's quite abit of straw-manning in this post,Neutral
AMD,"It only asked me to do it last evening, and I had it since release. And it was Radeon Graphics. I also think it should be higher since at least where I’m from, they were flying off the shelves for a good period after launch because they weren’t as overpriced as the green ones.",Neutral
AMD,"We can see the financials.  They sold 750M in RDNA4.  AMD increased sales by 70%.  I personally got a 9070 because it's awesome for Linux.  These are hit pieces designed to move the stocks.  Nothing more.  Nvidia does not have 90%+ of the market.  They have 75-80% though.  Now that AMD has a good product, buying Nvidia just means prices will continue to skyrocket.  Tragedy of the commons.",Positive
AMD,"RX 90 cards are still not present in meaningful enough numbers to show up in overall share (>0.15%)   However you can find:  * the 9070 at 0.20% and 9070 GRE at 0.02% if you sort by WIndows (Vulkan) systems * the 9070 at 0.10% and 9070 GRE at 0.01% if you sort by WIndows 10 (DX12) systems * the 9070 at 0.10% and 9070 GRE at 0.01% if you sort by WIndows (DX11) systems * the 9070/GRE/XT at 1.05% if you sort by Linux systems, where Linux accounts for 2.64% of the steam ecosystem  They simply dont sell enough of them   We literally just got a market report from JPR showing that Nvidia has a 94% market share for q2 in GPUs. While AMD has 6%>  They were 92% for Nvidia and 8% for AMD in Q1 of this year.   https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q225-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-increased-27-0-from-last-quarter/",Neutral
AMD,"AMD fanboys definitely like their daily cope... Look, if you like your Radeon GPU that's fine, but it doesn't change the fact that on a global scale basically noone buys them, which is correctly represented by steam hardware surway. There may be some bugs here and there like you mentioned (which is also AMDs fault), but it doesn't mean all these unidentified GPUs are 9000 generation. On the contrary, all available evidence suggests that all of them combined are no more than 1% of total GPUs, so the discussed arrticle is most likely still true despite AMDs another fuck up with their GPU identifiers.",Neutral

AMD,"It's more of a bug with AMD putting generic descriptions into their driver inf files so that what shows in Device Manager is so generic as to be completely useless.

AMD,"Genuinely yeah, seems like it.

AMD,"The generic name shown that people are referring to is what shows up in windows for the AMD igpu on 7000/9000 series chips.  I'm willing to bet that something in Steams detection logic is taking the AMD integrated instead of dedicated on systems with 2 AMD gpus.  I wouldn't be surprised if detection logic is as simple as, if Nvidia, use that (because anything remotely modern doesn't have Nvidia integrated), if AMD grab first AMD, then use Intel.

Also, AMD cards aren't really available in pre builds, so thats another route for the Nvidia offerings to be sold.   I think there is an over reaction to the jpr data. AMD by Q2 just did not have the quantity to compete against Nvidia offerings. It has nothing to do with quality. I would love to see the end of year data. Even though, AMD wont have as much quantity as Nvidia, they would have more than just the two offerings in Q2.",Neutral

It’s just Reddit bubble where people are under the impression that AMD sold a crap ton of cards because thats what they see here, Sure but comparatively, they didn’t well at all.   Q1 shipments were only 750,000 AMD  dGPUs compared to 9+ million for Nvidia GPUs…. and market share was 92%-8% So any stockpiling that happens was mostly on Q2 and it couldn’t have been any better because the gap between AMD and Nvidia dGPU shipments got even bigger. 94%-6%.     All the data lines up but I guess the feelings don’t and that requires some coping and mental gymnastics.",Neutral

The weird thing about the ""AMD Radeon"" entries is that they're not really growing, going from a combined 4.1% in April to 4.0% last month.

Even if they were mostly RDNA4, it wouldn’t matter much because guess what Nvidia shipped out in same period of all their dGPUs……..9.2 million. Yah that’s 750,000 vs 9.2 million. This amounted to 92%-8% market.   That was Q1, the Q2 report just released and the gap is now 94%-6%.  AMD LOST 2% share… so clearly it wasn’t ramped up to where it mattered and still lost market.    Nvidia is out producing and out shipping AMD 94-6. We’re literally comparing thousands to millions lol, wtf did people think was gonna happen?  If I put 100 cards in a box and tell you randomly pick 10…… what’s the probability you’ll pick AMD when there’s only 6 AMD cards in the box and other 94 are Nvidia????

AMD just didn't have the quantity to compete for market share. So it's not really about quality. Nvidia outnumbered AMD for those particular periods. End of year data would be more telling imo, because there would be more AMD offerings in the market with the 9070,9070xt,9070gre,9060xt,9060 ( prebuilts)..still not more than Nvidia, but much better than just the 2 offerings back in Q1/Q2.",Neutral

The Steam survey is asking *every single device* who they are, it's simply not possible for Valve to know every single device in the entire world by their hardware IDs and whatnot. This is why there exists a standard way in which the devices themselves announce who they are to the operating system (via drivers), and then Steam asks the OS what devices it has.  This is assuming that the other person is correct in their initial claim of ""*a bug with AMD putting generic descriptions into their driver inf files*"" in the first place, if it's something else entirely then obviously the responsibility can shift. For example some people in the comments here have been saying that AMD reports 9070 XT properly, but Steam incorrectly picks the integrated GPU instead, in which case the fault would again be Valve's. I'm not sure who's in the right or if there are multiple issues going on simultaneously.",Negative
AMD,They do provide exactly the kind of information AMD puts there for the world to see.,Neutral
AMD,"Windows, and HW info both show that I have a rx 9070, steam reports it as AMD graphics   Steam is fucking up",Negative

AMD,"Have you seen Microsoft errors lately? Killing SSDs, rampant micro stutter issues, usb issues, like they aren’t getting the basic shit right",Negative
AMD,"It has been a recurring theme. This is just one example. There has also been another issue where if you update driver via AMD software, Windows would update a completely seperate version on its and refuse to run the Adrenaline version.  I mean, sure, AMD can run after Microsoft or adjust their code to fix it asap. But to be clear, this isn't even just AMDs fault - there are many other non-AMD drivers where you run into similar issues because Microsoft is slower than their cycle or w/e. So clearly, the way Windows is getting its drivers is flawed. Nvidia has no issue because they effectively set the standard.  But either way, Windows should not just kill working drivers in the background. If Windows recognises an issue with an unrecognised driver, it could just open a pop-up and ask ""You are using an unrecognised driver. Install the Windows recommended driver? Yes - Later - Skip this version"". And that's it. Issue fixed forever for all hardware.",Negative
AMD,"That was one of my replies a few days ago to one of these posts. The 7800XT selling super well out of nowhere to appear on the list was very sus, but since this list is one of the only bits of information we have on the gaming hardware market share, people are going to give it more credibility because it obviously reports the Nvidia GPUs properly",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe so. But I don't think it is a surprise that AMD didn't gain any market share for that particular period. The 9070 series launched near the end of Q1, and went out of stock after a few days of it's launch. This lasted quite some time. In that time the 5090/5080 started to gain more stock, the 5070ti was above MSRP but available . The 5070 launched and nobody was interested. AIB's had to cut the 5070 price for it to sell. In fact, it was the first GPU to drop below MSRP. This was the only reason for it selling, as everything else from AMD side was not available. Then the 5060ti is in the market for couple months before the 9060xt launches near the end of Q2.   So Q1/Q2 was never a settled period for anyone trying to buy a 9000 series card. The only real option was a Nvidia offering. And most consumers will rather stick to what they know than wait for something they never experienced.  Q3 is the only period where every GPU is easily accessible. So, I believe end of year will show a different data.   AMD has to take some blame for postponing the initial launch and marketing ect. But  AIB's also play a part. I see their part  as market manipulation. Some of the prices they set was just ridiculous. Nvidia GPUs in the majority did not face that level of extortion.",Neutral
AMD,And it also mentioned strong radeon gpu demand,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, we're on the Internet so obviously it has to be a conspiracy!   AMD finally have competitive cards this generation but they're not producing them in the same volume as Nvidia, probably because the last time they tried that they ended up with too much inventory.",Neutral

AMD,So it's a casual survey sent to you not something you can search in steam?,Neutral
AMD,"That I agree with, obviously.  But if you’re doing a survey you kinda have to make sure you’re providing the correct information.  So in my option the blame is shared.",Neutral
AMD,"This or similar post comes up every single time the survey comes up. Only to be then questioned because half the people say it is reporting correctly and other half is vehemently saying it doesn’t (though they often fail to provide any evidence of it).   At the same time the survey is at random selection. Perhaps there aren’t as many RDNA 4 users when it was conducted?   Per Jon Peddie research/report, in Q1 2025, AMD shipped only 750,000 discrete GPUs and bulk of those were RDNA3. During this same period, Nvidia shipped 9+ million. Thats a HUGE difference. This accounted to 92-8 market split.   Q2 2025, where you’d expect nothing but massive RDNA4 shipments actually Dropped. That split is now 94-6…… a measily 6%.  When Nvidia is out shipping AMD GPUs 94:6, the probability of being selected for survey is already very low. So it’s no surprise that it didn’t pass the minimum threshold to show up on the Steam charts.   But I guess copium is an addictive and powerful drug and will blur out the facts and reality.",Neutral

AMD,"As far as SSD issues, it's generally the manufacturers firmware or drivers at fault.   They should be able to survive a particularly intense round of writes from Windows update.

What does that tell you?   > usb issues  Again, what platform or devices?   Microsoft does a lot wrong. They've nuked production servers with updates, broken countless device drivers with security updates, and definitely had their share of basic missteps, but you can't just blame everything on them.",Negative
AMD,"I explained the what and the why - AMD can fix this themselves. It isn't a ""run after Microsoft"" to fix it, Microsoft didn't do it.   Where it's an issue, the manufacturer has messed up their version and recommended driver info - so if they want to fix that they can, but they choose not to.   AMD also has issues with driver detection and upgrades, and again that isn't Microsoft's problem. I've had to fix issues with this before, where AMD's ""solution"" to the problem they created was to reinstall the OS.   I'm just pointing out that Windows and Microsoft get a lot of blame for things that aren't really their problem.  Edit: For context, I run Linux on the machine in my flair and game on a 5800x3d Radeon 6800 system. Y'all downvoting fanboys need to think a little instead of assuming I'm saying ""AMD bad"" or Microsoft is flawless.",Negative

AMD,I haven't seen the report you mentioned but does it show the difference between sales to corporations and sales to individuals? I would bet that even though Nvidia has far more sales much less of them as a percentage would be going to individual consumers than to corporate AI/Server usage at this point.  My reasoning for this is Steam is mostly surveying individuals playing video games not the GPU market as a whole and I believe more Nvidia GPUs are used in business applications due to higher power and CUDA support.,Neutral

Within those groupings the higher the model number the higher AMD is rating its performance. I.e. 9800x > 9600x. The first number of the 4 also indicate what overall generation the CPU belongs to. All 5000 series CPUs are (mostly) part of the same generation for example.   Just like with Intel CPUs, there are exceptions and cases where the higher number isn't necessarily better for every use case. For a full picture you really need to read reviews and see some benchmarks of the CPUs doing things that are important to you.",Neutral
AMD,"Okay so the 3/5/7/9 whatever is irrelevant. Ignore that. Just like Intel. The 3/5/7/9 on Intel is also irrelevant.  The important bit is the four numbers, as these are unique to each CPU.

If you wanted the Zen 5 generation, it'd be a 9800X3D.  Exactly the same as Intel.

AMD,"It's supposed to be the same but but are pretty inconsistent with their names.   First of all, it doesn't matter as much which CPU you buy for gaming or single threaded loads. The performance is slightly better on higher end parts because of higher clock speeds but it's not really relevant. The key difference between them is in core count and multi threaded performance.   And this is horribly inconsistent, especially for AMD.    Both dropped the i3 Ryzen 3 or u3 designation which makes comparisons more difficult. But if we go by current multi thread performance it's roughly like that:  Ryzen 5: equivalent to non k intel u5 (would have been a Ryzen/i3 back then)   Ryzen 7: equivalent to intel u5/i5 with a k   Ryzen 9 (X900): equivalent to i7/ u7   Ryzen 9 (X950): equivalent to the i9/u9",Neutral

When you go to the final top end CPUs like 7950 there becomes a slight issues, as they are often 2ccds, so don't run games as well, most games can't utilize both CCDs. They are better for production.

AMD,"This low key sucks ass, unless the game is genuinely impressive with graphics, physics, and AI.  Also using frame gen to get 60 is a terrible idea.  You shouldn't be using frame gen with a native 30fps.  Good thing I got this game for free.",Negative
AMD,"The feeling, when you see your CPU, is mentioned as recommended.",Neutral
AMD,This makes absolutely no sense…so I could play ultra settings with 4080 super but not really because I have 7800 x3D? Also isn’t this CPU faster in games than 14900K? Somebody use chat gpt to make this I swear 😂,Negative
AMD,"The GPU requirements for low were ok until i read ""30 fps"" + paired with the somewhat elevated CPU requirements for all settings...  Lets not even talk about FRAME GENERATION FOR ULTRA 60FPS > im tired of companies abusing this technology to skip doing a proper optimization work.  Based SOLELY on this requirements chart, the performance will be shit.",Negative
AMD,i almost never buy games on launch day.  10$ says this is going to be buggy and broken initially so i better just ignore it and wait a year,Negative
AMD,30fps should be deleted from being minimum in any game. No one wants to play a jittery slideshow.,Negative
AMD,They're recommending a 7900GRE and 4070Ti for 4K HIgh. I think that's pretty good isn't it?,Positive
AMD,Ill just play on high lol. My 9070xt isnt even going to try ultra 4k 😅,Neutral
AMD,The Beast was meant to be a DLC for a 2022 video game.  Don't get too excited by the low system requirements 😂,Neutral
AMD,"And my 7900 GRE will need FSR, because why not?",Neutral
AMD,"It all depends on how intensive the game is. We routinely used the RTX 2080 Ti for 4K 60FPS gaming, and the B580 on that same kind of level.  Given its requirement for 4K60 at ""Ultra"" is just 12 GB VRAM, this probably isn't a hugely intensive game.  All that said, however, this is likely a mistake. The B580 is already in the 1440p 60 boxes and it isn't keeping up with an RX 9070 or the RTX 5070 alternative.  What's weirder than this are the CPU requirements. The 7950X3D (Ultra) is **slower** than the 7800X3D (High) unless the game is using utterly silly numbers of threads. The ""Minimum"" Ryzen 7 5800F isn't even a real thing!  Nobody has put much thought into this at all.",Neutral
AMD,70gb storage  https://i.redd.it/hbfuai741tmf1.gif,Neutral
AMD,"This seems like some nonsense. B580 for both recommended and ultra? Cpu requirements are insanely high too. The best option, like always, is to wait for the game to come out and check out some youtube videos w.r.t. to your specs and then make a decision.",Negative
AMD,Why do you need a top X3D 16c chip for 4k Ultra with RT + FG  That's asking for too much even for 4k High,Negative
AMD,ohhhkay so my 1080 should do 1080p60 at medium-high.. as it does with everything else. yay.,Positive
AMD,I have an RX 6600 and an i7-11700 and a 1080p monitor  I have absolutely no bloody idea how this game will run for me. But I'm hoping for at least medium settings at 60FPS. Probably wishful thinking on my part.,Negative

AMD,First time I've ever seen the GRE mentioned in one of these lol,Neutral
AMD,This game is supposed to be basically a DLC of DL2. so why the fuck a 6750xt is for 1440p medium? If it can max out DL2 easily at 1440p native. Cut the bullshit,Negative
AMD,Man the specs are cooked low 30 fps even with a ryzen 7.,Negative
AMD,"I'd imagine cpu specs are that high because of how many zombies can be rendered at once and if they have more than the most basic of AI save for the mutations.  Still, box specs aren't always a great metric to go by.",Neutral
AMD,I’d guess it’s a mistake?,Neutral
AMD,"the Ryzen 7 5800F doesn't exist. why is the B580 both in 1440p medium and 4k ultra? why does 4k ultra (with frame gen, so technically the cpu renders 30fps) require a Ryzen 9 7950X3D when 4K high requires a Ryzen 7 7800X3D (here cpu renders 60fps), those cpus have the same perfomance. why does 4K high require a 4070 Ti and 4K ultra a 5070, which is slightly weaker.",Negative
AMD,"Talks about the 7900 GRE (Sold way less then an XTX) and 9070xt but not the 7900xtx? 7800x3d which is faster in gaming recommending for lower then the 7950x3d which is for higher recommendations but performs worse? Then Intel Arc B580 recommended for 1440p60 and also for 4k Ultra Ray Tracing 60fps (THIS CARD BARELY DOES 1440P)? Huh? And then a 5800f? What is that? this CPU doesn't even exist! THEN A 7800X3D FOR 4K HIGH? THE DIFFERENCE IN 4K FOR A 5800X3D AND A CREAM OF THE CROP 9850X3D IS LIKE 5-10% (In BF6 it's 7%) WHO TF MADE THIS? WITH FRAMEGEN AND UPSCALING FOR THIS?  This genuinely makes no sense, this cannot be real. This also has to be the most demanding ""traditional"" game for these requirements I've ever seen. Framegen to get 60fps on Ultra 4k? What is going on? This started as a DLC for a 2022 game? This has to have been made by an unpaid intern using ChatGPT. Monster Hunter Wilds spec chart is like half as demanding as this games and we all know how that played out. Rip Techland, this game wont' sell because no one can play it.",Negative

AMD,"This shit is so wrong on so many levels, they don't even care to put real hardware on it.  ""Ryzen 9 7800X3D"" doesn't even exist, 7950X3D isn't faster than 7800X3D in most games, so why it's included for 4K with RT/FG, shouldn't it be 9800X3D?.  ""Ryzen 7 5800F"" doesn't exist. Arc A750 Is 87% faster than 5500XT and 1060 and has more VRAM and it's in the same category for 1080p 30fps low.  The Intel I5 13400F doesn't change from ""30fps low"" to 60fps medium"" but the jump from 5800F (X)?? to Ryzen 7 7700 is pretty big.  Arc B580 being for ""4K with Ultra RT/FG"" and for medium 1440p/60FPS is insane. The 9070 and 5070 are 80-100% faster than that.",Negative
AMD,"this chart doesn't make sense to me. my ryzen 5600x cpu and 7800xt gpu should be more than enough for 1440p 60fps, and should be enough for far more than that, but this chart is making it seem like the cpu will be a bottleneck for performance?   Looking at the chart again, the recommendations just aren't adding up to me. Im thinking this chart has, possibly, misinformed or incorrect information right now, and that ill probably be fine for 1440p 60fps.",Negative
AMD,Ryzen 7 5700F ???,Neutral

AMD,In what world is the b580 equal to the 5070/9070?,Neutral
AMD,"Is this AI generated? These are rarely consistent or but this one is really bad. An A750 can only do 1080p 30 but a b580 can do 1440p 60? A b580 can do their medium, can't do high but ultra works again? A 5070 being significantly better than a 4070 Ti? And what the hell is a 5800f? Ultra including frame gen?   What were they thinking?",Negative
AMD,People makes games in 15 min at UE5.  No optimisation.  Game sector went fast food from fine dining.,Negative
AMD,"FSR 4, hell yeah.",Positive
AMD,want this game!,Positive
AMD,Does a Ryzen 7 5800F exist? It's listed under 1080p/30 or did they mean 5800X?,Neutral
AMD,"These days, resolution and framerate targets are both useless... We need to know if this is at NATIVE resolution and with or without the fake frames...",Negative
AMD,"i dont trust the cpu requirements, i would definitly take something newer than a 14xxx series from intel",Negative
AMD,The CPU requirements are nonsensical. They recommend a 7950X3D for 4K Ultra with RT and the 7800X3D for High 4K when the 7950X3D is slower for gaming than the 7800X3D lol.  I wouldn't worry too much about it. Your CPU will be more than fine.,Negative
AMD,"Its funny how games like cyberpunk and kcd2 recommend a 7800x3d, but a 7600x is perfectly fine and will give you high fps even in cpu intensive areas, yet a game like stalker 2 which recommends a 3700x, you will be bottlenecked at 85 fps",Negative
AMD,Yea it looks to me that these have to be typos.  Can’t imagine it being that intensive especially at 4K when it comes to the CPU and then regarding the intel gpu……..maybe it’s the persons first day on the job?  This seems wrong that’s all I’m saying.  However optimization these days is rather lack luster so who knows?,Negative
AMD,That’s what I was thinking… seeing something other than 5700x3D or 5800x3D makes me wonder…,Neutral
AMD,Does cou requierement ever actually matter?  So manny times it says I will need better than my 13600k but there are never any issues,Negative

AMD,"Same with ""Ryzen 9 7800 X3D""  Also who tf use frame gen to reach 60 FPS?",Neutral
AMD,"At 30 fps no less (60fps fg, so the CPU only sees 30 fps). This tells you all the people who made/approved this chart are clueless.",Negative

AMD,4k 60 with RT... With a 5070...,Neutral
AMD,With ray tracing though.,Neutral
AMD,ppl forget ultra usually is future proof settings. using frame gen to achieve it makes sense,Neutral

AMD,"I don't know if it's true but I think it's intel sponsored game(people in dying light sub claim it is) , but still even that won't push b580 for 4k ultra gaming lol , and it was posted by someone official from techland in dying light sub  Edit: why down votes?",Negative
AMD,For real. Guess my rig is now trash 🤷🏽‍♂️,Negative
AMD,Well.........yeah u had me here,Neutral
AMD,And look at cpu recommended. They feel insane   My poor 3600xt crying in the corner,Negative
AMD,"Where does it say that?   It usually says if the requirements are with upscaling taken into consideration, as with the FG for 4K Ultra RT.",Neutral
AMD,The Ultra requirements are aiming for 60 fps with frame gen so actually 30 so it kinda makes sense...  There's also no talk of upscaling here which I find hard to believe.   This is probably made my an intern.,Neutral

Captured in a CPU heavy area that they use in all their CPU & GPU testing. You can easily see the differences between CPUs. Even my 9800x3D is CPU often limited in many ways. Not so much when playing with locked 120Hz, but definitely when going any higher.   Edit. One addition. When using high GPU intensive path tracing, it will also tank the CPU performance. Something that actually got my mind blowed when I tested this on my 5800x3D & 9800x3D. Already CPU intensive titles have a hard time when using the PT.  https://preview.redd.it/yyw9oejud0nf1.jpeg?width=1216&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fef5205dddcf03ee0df8972aad5e3b6c8da0f6b9",Neutral
AMD,"3070ti for native 1440p 60 fps at medium doesn’t seem to be horrible. I’m sure there is many settings that don’t change fidelity a lot but eat up fps, so putting some to low and some to high may be a better experience. This also seems pretty damn general of a spec sheet here, almost like it’s useless based on some things here.   Throw on dlss with the 3070 ti and enjoy probably like 80 fps.  It does seem to be a gorgeous looking game too.   However, I’m not trying to defend it, and I would expect it to be optimized for the money that they’re asking. Like any game these days. And if it’s not it should be hated on.",Neutral
AMD,"To be fair, dying light has always been a very AI heavy game, so requiring a beefy CPU makes sense. Specially if any of the zombies can parkour at all.",Neutral
AMD,60 fps target with raster performance is a very sensible target.,Positive
AMD,and in 4K,Neutral
AMD,I don't mind if they recommend frame gen for something more logical like 120+ fps where the latency won't be super horrible. But requiring frame gen just to get 60 fps means the experience is going to suck. I'd rather play at 30 fps than with the weird feeling latency that frame gen causes when working with a low starting frame rate.,Negative
AMD,It still is the input latency of 25fps,Neutral
AMD,"With cheese Mr Squidward, with cheese.",Neutral
AMD,"No it’s a perfectly valid thing to point out, there is a massive difference between 4k 60 and 4k 60 with frame generation.   This is coming from someone who generally enjoys frame generation, but what has allowed me to enjoy it is knowing how to use it properly, and going from sub 60fps up to 60 is not the right way to use frame generation.",Neutral
AMD,fuck the devs,Negative
AMD,"If it's not a mistake, maybe frame gen and upscaling make it technically possible, but with unbearable latency.",Negative
AMD,"I was being ironic. Every UE5 game I’ve played needed upscaling to hit 60+ fps, e.g. MGS3 Delta, Oblivion Remastered, KCD 2 (real good game). But that's just me being annoying, wanting everything on ultra.",Neutral
AMD,"yeah ""intel sponsored game"" but Arc A750 that is 87% faster than the 5500XT/1060 is for 1080p low 30fps, and that argument is dead. B580 doesn't have enough power to play at 4k, the difference between B580 and 5070/9070 is so massive it won't matter anyway that it's better optimized for battlemage architecture. That's just cope",Negative
AMD,"Oh great, my 14900 is going to overheat just like in bf6",Positive
AMD,Isn't the non-X3D CCD basically turned off when gaming? By the X3D boost setting?,Neutral
AMD,"It’s not ‘it’s possibly’ it’s most likely what it is, for some reason many people think cpu > next to irrelevant but it absolutely isn’t for *specific* games, devs put this out there for a good reason probably",Neutral
AMD,Multithreaded optimizations are notoriously difficult for most developers. I doubt this game needs that much throughput.,Negative
AMD,9950X3D is notably an exception to the rule. The 7950X3D was and is slower than the 7800X3D.,Neutral
AMD,"Emmm the game looks just like DL2, and that gpu maxed out the game easily, so why now barely 60 at medium?  crap optimization",Negative
AMD,"But as we're told by Jensen, AI runs on the (Nvidia) GPU, right?",Neutral
AMD,It's with the Ray Tracing ON that's why it requires frame gen especially on Ultra 4K. Stop rushing and read more carefully.,Neutral
AMD,... The B580 definetley has 12GB of Vram wdym.,Neutral
AMD,If they implement every single optimiztaion intel recommends then its more than possible to get 4K 60K on the B580 with FG.,Positive
AMD,"Ah, I guess it's not out of the realms of possibility these days anyway 😂  Yeah UE5 is the worst. I've not *had* to use upscaling on my 9070 XT at 1440p ultra for a playable experience but since I prefer a higher refresh rate experience then I've usually had it stick it on to quality to get that experience when other games/engines I can easily play native and do that.  The newest version of XeSS is decent if you're on RDNA 3.",Negative
AMD,"To be fair, Bf6 is particularly CPU heavy. My wife's 5600x was at 100% usage the entire time the game was open. My 9950x3d would be as high as 60% avg on one or 2 maps",Neutral
AMD,"No, it is still active! The problem with the 7950x3D (and 5950x3D) is that some processes can go to the part without the 3D-Vcache. So you could say the problem is that it isn't turned off, or rather that the scheduler doesn't prioritise correctly.",Negative
AMD,Not if you bother spending 10 seconds properly configuring your $900 CPU.,Neutral
AMD,You can literally just turn off CCD1 on the 7950X3D and it'll run as a slightly upgraded 7800X3D. Proper CPPC and Process LASSO configuration will make it always run better or the same.,Positive
AMD,I got like 85 fps in ultrawide with a mixed/ ultra settings. What are you talking about?,Negative
AMD,Why are you assuming I didn’t know it was with RT on?,Neutral
AMD,"The issue is that FG is a “win more” tool. You don’t use FG for sub 60 to get to 60, as it has poor latency. Generally not a good experience.",Negative
AMD,"The issue is I’m expecting 4K Ultra out of a 1440p card; as I game at 5120x1440, about 20% shy of 4K.      But honestly, I don’t care that much, I’ve played games at 40/45 and still had fun with awesome graphics. I just need stability.",Negative
AMD,My 5070 was bottlenecked by my 5700x3d in bf6,Neutral
AMD,"I throttled my cpu and had no dips in performance, temps went back down to 60ish. I don’t think they were utilizing the cores correctly or something.",Negative
AMD,"To be perfectly fair, a lot of people who are spending $900 on a CPU are fairly reasonably expecting it to just work best out of the box.  A lot of the ""value"" of most super premium consumer products is the fact that everything is handled for you.",Neutral
AMD,Wow sounds like a great deal for hundreds more lol,Positive
AMD,"but you have a 5070 not a 6750xt/3070ti..................................   Edit: also, barely 80fps on a 5070 on and old gen game is HORRIBLE",Negative
AMD,Man do you even realize how demanding the RT is? they put a 5070 there not a 5090.,Negative
AMD,"Makes sense, my 7800xt was about right with my 5700x3d. There was no bottleneck since all my components were fully utilised",Positive
AMD,"If money isn't an issue, yeah actually. It's at parity or slightly better in gaming with massive headroom, and completely shreds it in productivity.",Negative
AMD,That’s what I got with my 3070ti and 5600x. I just recently upgraded. I get far more fps now on max settings with raytracing.,Positive
AMD,"Yes, I use RT often so I know how heavy it is, in fact I used it in the DL2 base game, but that’s neither here nor there when it comes to my point.   They really shouldn’t be labelling it as 4k 60 if they are using frame generation to get there. Nobody will realistically want to used FG to get from sub 60fps up to 60, so they should have just put 4k 30fps in that category.",Neutral
AMD,"You won't need frame gen to hit 60 if you have a current gen card like 5080.   5070 has the performance of a 3080ti or 4070ti, both cards for 2K nowadays. Look at it as a sign of good optimization for those that have 4K monitors.  I also don't use FG, but the graphic looks better rather than slapping 5080 there to brute force it.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah I’m aware of all of that, but again it’s not really my point, my point is that they really shouldn’t be marking it up at 4k 60 for those cards, probably in the hopes that a lot of people will just skim over it and not see the bit further down in brackets that you actually need to use frame generation to achieve that with those cards.   It’s misleading at best, as those cards won’t get near 60 fps with those settings without it, and it’s not the way FG is supposed to be used, it would be an awful experience, they either should have listed the actual cards you will need to get 4k 60 with those settings, or marked that category as 4k 30fps.",Negative

AMD,"EXCELLENT DEAL, the 7900xtx is one of the very best gpu's its a little better then the 9070xt which is a 700$ GPU, and the 7800x3d is a great cpu worth around 360$ the rest of the parts are high quality and balanced, if you tried to build yourself it would cost a fair bit more  Buy it and enjoy",Positive
AMD,Seems a little high considering it is used,Neutral
AMD,"its decently priced, you could always try to haggle it down a hundred or 2.",Neutral
AMD,"I don't think it's worth it. You can build a 9070 brand new system for 1500$ and it has the same performance as the 7900XTX, but much better power efficiency and an actual usable upscaler.  https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cPyBVF",Negative
AMD,Thank you! It costs a decent bit more especially considering I’m in Denmark and the prices differ a bit on the parts than in the US.,Positive
AMD,"Thank you!! Hopefully I’ll get to buy it, I’m in the process of doing so right now but the logistics is a bit of a challenge 🤞",Positive
AMD,It can't be very used and maybe not at all. The x870 hasn't been out that long.,Negative

AMD,I’ve actually haggled it down 350$ so this is the lowest he’ll agree on - but thank you!,Positive
AMD,"A 9070 XT doesnt perform as well as a 7900 XTX much less a 9070. It only has an advantage in ray tracing and FSR4. And FSR 2/3 is more than usable, games actually support FSR 2/3",Neutral
AMD,"Hopefully so, if there is competition at all you can outbid the opponents a little :)",Positive
AMD,oh okay I was thinking of pricing in the US which is normally cheaper than most countries. This is probably pretty decent value then,Neutral
AMD,For $1150 it's a great deal.,Positive
AMD,"oh it's the XTX. My bad I looked up the XT. FSR 2/3 is really shimmery in modern games and UE5, so while it is usable I think it is too much of a downgrade in visuals if you're not playing at 4k. But yeah the 7900 XTX is better than the 9070, my bad",Negative

AMD,Dont really trust the Ai but thought id check it out. Thanks for the tip.,Neutral
AMD,Thank you for this.,Positive
AMD,No problem,Neutral
AMD,Try disabling the integrated graphics in your Radeon settings and then restarting your PC and trying the game again. Also turn on freesync and enhanced sync if your display’s refresh rate is less than your FPS,Neutral
AMD,"* Your RAM is only at 5200MHz, is this expected? * Is your storage more than 90% full?",Neutral
AMD,got 200 fps and my refresh rate is 144 rn so that isnt an issue either. Im gonna try to disable the integrated graphics,Neutral
AMD,yeah its supposed to be 5200 didnt buy 6000 and the pc is new I got 1.7 TB left,Neutral
AMD,I’ve had displays where there was screen tearing because the FPS was higher than the screen’s refresh rate. Enhanced Sync will keep screen tearing from happening if your FPS is higher than your screen’s refresh rate but it Enhanced Sync doesn’t lock the frame rate and cause lag like V-Sync does,Neutral
AMD,how do I enable that? but idk it isnt screen tearing its stuttering. like my fps drops. Ive build plenty of pcs but this is the first time I experience this,Negative
AMD,It’s in your Radeon settings. Make sure to disable any v-sync options in your game’s settings,Neutral
AMD,yeah already done that,Neutral
AMD,cant find it tho. this is my first build with a radeon card,Neutral
AMD,Inside the Radeon settings click on gaming and then graphics and you’ll see Radeon Enhanced Sync,Neutral
AMD,"Being that two completely different computers (different motherboard = different computer) had the same issue, it’s probably your router or modem",Negative
AMD,"These might not help, but it's easy to try and won't mess up anything (and it's easy to undo):  If you're on Win11, open the Control Panel (not the settings gear icon, the older Control Panel) you may have to use the search function to find it. Click on System and Security, then on Power Options. Once there, select the High Performance plan as your default and then click Change Plan settings under it. From there select Advanced Power settings and a small window will pop up. In these settings, make sure Wireless Adapter Settings (expand) > Power Saving Mode (expand) > Maximum Performance is enabled. Then scroll down USB settings (expand) > USB Suspend (expand)> Disabled. Then hit Apply at the bottom, then wait a second and hit OK.  After doing that, press the windows key and select shutdown. Once the PC is fully shut down, physically unplug it from the wall. Then hold the power button on for 5 seconds. Then plug it back in and turn on the PC and see if that changes anything.",Neutral

AMD,"Just give me ""Metroplex heeds the call of the last prime."" A 64 Gb card so we can run decent local models",Neutral
AMD,"Does any of this even matter? I got an RX 9070 non-XT because after vouchers and platform discounts it was cheaper than even the cheapest RTX 5070 in my region. Undevolted really well but it performs like a drunken master. Some games like 10-15% faster than something like a RTX3080, in some games nearly twice as fast. It's all over the place depending on title all white consumption was around 230W a good 100-110W lower than most OC RTX 3080s yet people are still buying Nvidia, JPDR now reports 94% market share. AMD will be forced to answer to investor pressure as they are not doing anything remotely useful to push their cards into the hands of gamers. The fake MSRPs are so bad in some places that after vouchers and platform discounts it is cheaper to get Nvidia.  My region and Mindfactory are the exceptions not the norm.  RDNA2 was a better showing but we never got to see how that would play out had the crypto cancer not happened.",Neutral
AMD,So MLID was right about that. AT0 = Alpha Trion.  https://i.redd.it/eh5jsgh7u0nf1.gif,Neutral
AMD,If UDNA/RDNA5 does not catch up in a meaningful way to NV or be heavily discounted compared to the last few gens I think AMD's discrete GPU division is dead.,Negative
AMD,AMD naming scheme strikes again.,Neutral
AMD,Hurry up! I am waiting to upgrade from my current 6900XT,Neutral
AMD,"Given their piss-poor track record of competition against Nvidia, maybe they should have started with Go-bot names.  They can upgrade to Transformer names when they decide to either beat Nvidia significantly at performance or undercut them in price by a significant amount instead of just coasting along at slightly under what Nvidia charges for the same performance...",Negative
AMD,Nvidia are going to be fucked when VOLTRON is formed. Flaming sword in their ass.,Negative
AMD,"Can they please just have it avaliable for the advertised price lol....  Wanted a 7 series...but ray tracing performance fell short of claims....so no 7900xtx.  Wanted a 9 series...but not in stock, and 600 was all but a lie...and i really didnt want to be stuck with a 16gb gpu anyway....so no 9070xt...  I still want a new gpu.....amd... Can you please offer me something at the performance you claim, for the price you claim, that is actually available with minimum 24g and ideally 32g+...my wallets open....but i want value....",Negative

AMD,Till all are one,Neutral
AMD,"Considering that the next architecture is supposed to be UDNA, not RDNA5, I don't have high hopes for the accuracy of the rest of the information.

AMD,What? Why not MegaUnicronPrime?,Neutral
AMD,the halo product that sell poorly?,Neutral
AMD,steam deck 2  codename squall when?,Neutral
AMD,they keep dropping older GPUs that have pytorch support that builds and runs just fine as well... very annoying.,Negative
AMD,You can already run PyTorch today using TheRock https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/RELEASES.md,Neutral
AMD,"""Ultra Magnus"" is at least a name I know.",Neutral
AMD,"That’s me, I don’t need 5090 performance, I need 5080 performance with more vram! That’s really it for my 3440x1440 set up. I was on the fence between the 7900XTX and the 4080 I got. Honestly I should have got the 7900xtx",Neutral
AMD,"I feel like thats been said for generations now and 9070XT launch, availability and price was a joke.",Negative
AMD,gonna be 9 years soon since ROCm has been waffling around.  for reference you could already use CUDA for enterprise and consumer software around 3 years in (Used it for avc encoding in editors back when SpursEngine was considered an actual viable choice).  AMD finally got video encoding to comparable quality only like two years ago. This is with 100x the money nvidia had when developing cuda. They are turning into Intel where they are slow as balls and push all the development work onto users.,Neutral
AMD,"The problem is not gamers in the DIY market. Figures from resellers in Europe show that the 9070 XT sells more than all RTX 5000 combined. In the US, it's less favorable due to higher prices for AMD which indicates that there is demand anyway.  I think the 94% come from China which favors Nvidia,  from OEMs which is dominated by Nvidia in prebuilts and laptops.  If AMD wants GPU market share, they need to attack those markets more aggressively.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm gonna get myself a 9070 (non-XT) this December, because it's the cheapest card of all",Positive
AMD,Easy there buddy... you'll anger the MLID reddit hate squad lol.,Negative
AMD,"I really hope AT2 XT is more than 18GB of VRAM, bc RDNA5/UDNA is supposedly coming out in 2027 and 18GB just won't cut it for the high end imo.",Negative
AMD,"they were ""dead"" between 2014 up to 2020 (when RDNA2 launched) and even that wast 1:1 parity with Nvidia feature wise  the GPU divison isnt going anywhere and they are at much better position now, even if they arent making high end GPUs, they pretty much closed all feature gaps (RT in RDNA4 is very decent, FSR4 quality is good, Perf/W and Perf/Area is very close) and they very likely going to keep designing console's GPUs and mid-range cards like the 9070xt",Neutral
AMD,Any time now.,Neutral
AMD,Get ready for a long wait and dissapointment,Neutral
AMD,"its not a grim as they put it....   Amd GPUs are still in consoles, all of the recent handhelds, steam decks, and a shitton of laptops have radeon graphics onboard.  amd graphics arent going anywhere. imo",Neutral
AMD,"For AMD, its never late as long as they sell enough cards to make a good profit. In recent years the RADEON side has been mostly production constrained. AMD sells mostly every card they produce. The issue with market share is that the production is small because CPUs are much more profitable.   For you, does It matter? ir you but what is best for you, does It matter if the market share is higher or lower? Games ""use"" RDNA. They won't run slower because the market share is lower.",Neutral
AMD,how can someone believe this,Neutral
AMD,"I bought a 9070XT for a few reasons. I got a reasonable price on one of the better reviewed cards, AMD has vastly improved their drivers over the last few years including the excellent FOSS Linux drivers, and the performance target was right where I wanted.   For what I paid, the card is excellent. It's reliable, it's not too bulky or loud, I use it on Linux. I can even play demanding games like *Monster Hunter Wilds* at 4K60 with ray tracing (some upscaling but no frame generation).  Even though nVidia might have market dominance, AMD's current offerings absolutely stand on their own.",Positive
AMD,I'd wait for rdna5 :) if amd won't fuck it ip,Negative
AMD,lmao,Neutral
AMD,little redditors trying to support a 260 billion dollar company  LMAO,Negative
AMD,"Properly done games use API not tied to specific hardware brand, like DirectX 11/12, Vulcan etc  So there's no problem as long as features required by games are supported by the GPU driver",Neutral
AMD,amd has like 100% of console gpus market  That 94% is silly numbers  only userbenchmark and hired nvidia shills believe such nonesense,Negative
AMD,"amd has overall 17% market share, even excluding igpus its still well over 10%, sales numbers don't mean that much, amd volume always stays on the shelves for long but once the price drops they are the best deal and everyone buys them, these stats only reflect the current gen gpus but most popular right now are still 7xxx and even some 6xxx,   back in 2018/2019 amd was selling so many rx 570/580 (because they were already old and very cheap) that they had like 50% share in sales",Neutral
AMD,"You fundamentally misunderstanding how game development works doesn't mean your new card will suddenly be unusable. Developers don't optimise for specific hardware (except in the case of consoles which, funnily enough, use all AMD hardware!) They use engines with features that both companies develop to utilise, and some products are better at that than others. You buy the underdog because it's (often) cheaper and you like a bargain. If you don't want that, don't buy it. Nvidia cards have better features and more widespread and robust support for those features.",Negative
AMD,"""wtf did I buy the underdog for beyond better morality?""   Well, avoiding the potential risk of fire for one",Neutral
AMD,its the best for your pricepoint at the time you buy. thats the end of it.,Positive
AMD,posts as of late are using udna and rdna5 synonymously under the auspice that engineering internally is doing the same,Neutral
AMD,Even Mark Cerny mentioned RDNA5 as the future of AMD. People interchange RDNA5 and UDNA because it's the same thing.,Neutral
AMD,Even Mark Cerny referred to RDNA5,Neutral
AMD,UDNA only means unified tbh. The micro arch is going to the original gcn days (gcn being the micro arch and not the isa) and that means the cdna and rdna is gonna merge. You may as well call it rdna and I won't be surprised. NGL rdna sounds so much cool,Positive
AMD,As someone that isn't much of a console guy what has Microsoft done to ruin it? All I know is they've never been as big as Playstation and thanks to them releasing console exclusives to PC we now have Sony doing the same. Seems like a huge win for PC gamers.,Positive
AMD,Primus sucks though,Neutral
AMD,And lower end should be called **Incontinentia Buttocks**.,Neutral
AMD,Any reasons they cannot make a halo product that sells wellly are purely technical in nature lol.,Negative
AMD,I'd like to remind you that on Steam alone there are more 5090s than any AMD GPU of the current gen,Neutral

AMD,"Not on windows without wsl, which also comes at a big performance loss",Neutral
AMD,"> should have got the 7900xtx  It sure seems like I am going to have mine from Jan 2023 until whenever they release RDNA5 so realistically ~4 years, and wow, just look at me cry a river because I am so sad about not having Nvidia that whole time, my tears are flooding the towns and drowning the townspeople, Noah's Ark is rising",Negative
AMD,"Same for me, my 2080Ti was a bit long in the tooth and 3080/90 was sheer unobtanium at that time. Got the 7900XTX. For 1440 ultrawide it is perfect and only real upgrade path is a 5090. That is not going to happen unless I win the lottery.",Neutral
AMD,"I will probably get the R9700 when it’s available. I use a Mac for training for the memory and MPS and ROCm are both 2nd class citizens for now, but I think that will change in the next 6-12 months.",Neutral
AMD,"lol there was maybe a bad two months before those GPUs were fairly available, with some models at MSRP. 9060XT stock is already completely stable, and that’s been out for less time as well.",Neutral
AMD,How was the pricing a joke if they couldn’t keep it in stock? NVIDIA and Apple have a massive part of the production of all of the latest nodes.  And I don’t think you know what rocm 7 has.,Negative
AMD,"You should tell the AMD customers that are spending billions on their datacenter GPUs, this is great, well researched info and they need to know.",Positive
AMD,"Figures from Europe? What are you talking about. What's your sources? Steam survey, JPR, all disagree with what you're saying. And don't even try to quite Mindfactory here. There's no way the numbers will be true if a single card variant 9070 XT outsells an entire product stack.",Negative
AMD,"Given  that in most titles at 1440p the gap between the XT and non-XT is not that impressive, it will come down to price in the particular region. For me I saw the XT prices were like 31% higher, not worth it. I can just undevolt non-XT keeping the same power target to close the gap in most cases. If you can get the XT for like 10% more that'd be the way to go and still undevolt it to get efficiency gains. If non- XT is the best value in your place just go for it, it's a very good card.   Surprised me in a lot of titles that nobody tests any more. A widely reported outlier and current AAA title is AC Shadows, non-XT is significantly faster than 3080 but I have seen this sort of outliers in older games, my example is ME Andromeda. I used a specific point in the game to test the most brutal frame rate drops.   Undevolt is a lottery, I was expecting to not be able to go lower than -40, maybe -50 but I've been good at -70 and -100, keeping it at -70 for the moment. Will try playing around a bit more to see how much further I can get it to undevolt. In any case without any undervolting the non-XT is a very good card at stock.",Negative
AMD,High-end is 36GB.   AT2 XT = 9070 XT sucessor = mid-end.,Neutral
AMD,"I'm sure if they could switch to Nvidia they would. I'm actually wondering why they don't. The first Xbox used Nvidia and currently Nintendo is the only manufacturer using them.  They've been behind on a lot of stuff we have on PC because they had to wait for AMD to catch up, and that hasn't fully happened yet",Neutral

AMD,"The fella that works at Sony?  > Big chunks of RDNA 5, or whatever AMD ends up calling it, are coming out of engineering I am doing on the project  That was the quote I could find, it doesn't sound like he had access to its proper name.",Neutral
AMD,"From what little I have read from actual AMD employees, it seems it is called unified not because they are merging the two archs, but because they are unifying the software stack between corporate and consumer hardware with the new arch, and providing only a single arch between them.",Neutral
AMD,"There are more reasons, but it started with the Xbox One. Just look at their *gaming* console reveal. The main message was not gaming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nULp0pGKCS8  In addition to that they wanted always online DRM and to fuck over customers that buy physical games in regards to reselling [0] and sharing them with friends.

AMD,I should have waited for few hours and got 7900XTX for less than 470€ instead of buying GRE for 430€ (was shopping for a used card few months ago and this still makes me annoyed at myself) What makes it worse is the fact that my GRE sucks at at any kind of OC so it's basically just a more expensive 7800XT,Negative
AMD,"I doubt rdna will launch in 2029, it will be more likely late 2026/early 2027",Negative
AMD,How much did they produce to begin with?,Neutral
AMD,"That has nothing to do with broad rocm support. no shit a company spending billions has engineers to write their own software. you fanboys are the reason they get nowhere with their software and I wouldn't be surprised if they went down the same route as intel in 5 years (straight into the bean counter toilet thanks to hubris).  and for comparison, nvidia has 7x the sales and higher profit margin. they are doing better than AMD and Intel combined. good job to AMD for losing leadership and tens of billions of dollars every quarter to a younger company I guess?",Negative
AMD,"Steam survey is the least reliable source as it includes every PC on the planet that installed Steam. For recent GPUs it's ok but the percentages are not representative of actual sales.

AMD,"Because Playstation, XBox, Steam Deck and practically all PC gaming handhelds use AMD GPUs?",Neutral
AMD,"First because dGPU is not even the main market for games. The console market is the main market and AMD dominates it. Game devs will very often plan their performance and graphics quality based on the console hardware.   Then, for the most part, devs don't even optimize that much for specific brands. The brand-specific optimization comes from the GPU-maker sending their own engineers to do the fine tuning. This is usually something proactively done by Nvidia/AMD, not something requested by the devs. As long as AMD is willing to invest in doing it, they will keep doing it.",Neutral
AMD,Every console game is made for rdna?,Neutral
AMD,"I mean rdna4 isn't big deal against rtx50 with greens better features like DLSS od Ray Traycing. Let AMD cook and see what happens next. Maybe their FSR, Fluid Motion Frames and ray traycing can get much better? And maybe not?

AMD,4 years from the time he bought it (in January of 2023) would be 2027.,Neutral
AMD,"I appreciate the passion, over a computing library...  rocm 7 (which it still seems like you do not have any info on) is a huge step forward, and for the first time AMD has committed to getting it to run on their consumer GPUs.  Logically somewhere between ""it sucks"" and ""it's awesome"" there must be ""hey this is pretty decent now"". I think people who actually use these tools are definitely seeing AMD getting to the third one now. One way they are doing this is to make the API much closer to CUDA so some ports are trivial. The R9700 has the same memory as an RTX 5000 and costs 1/3. For many people like me who do ML and don't need 4/8 bit or use transformers, it's a steal.  It takes 3-4 years to build a new architecture - you can bet in 2022 AMD shifted to making something more competitive with the tensor cores. Look what they did to intel with Zen. So I would expect this time next year a very different landscape.",Positive

AMD,why is your picture covered in mold,Neutral
AMD,This is exactly my point there is no reason for even gfx803 to the disabled... yes somethings will not work but it the code still functions for what it can even in the lastest ROCm... they just disabled it and shot their customers in the foot for no reason.  If it were unsupported and they only accept patches for fixes and dont' provide them themselves we'd be much better off than them entirely disabling working code.,Negative
AMD,Well it was just bad luck as i had been looking for a card for few weeks with nothing good coming up. So instead of paying 400€ for a used 7800XT or 3080 i went with the GRE. Then obviously few hours after i bought it that XTX came available.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah I can easily wait another 18 months. If the 4090 could have pumped the G9 57"" at 240Hz it would have been an option, too. But that only became possible with Blackwell and the upgrade to 5090 from XTX modOC is maybe 40% which would uhhh, not improve things much in practice with driver frame gen at 120fps cap. It would literally just be a $2500 Nvidia 7900 XTX for me. And then I'd block it and try overclocking and melt the goddamn 12 pin, nah, bro. I can wait.",Neutral
AMD,"> rocm 7 (which it still seems like you do not have any info on) is a huge step forward  I'll believe it when I see it. AMD doesn't exactly have a brilliant track record with ROCm thus far and there's no evidence to suggest that anything's going to change. ROCm isn't going to get any better without more money getting thrown into it.  > It takes 3-4 years to build a new architecture  And much longer to come up with an actually useful, well documented and well supported software stack that rivals CUDA.  >  Look what they did to intel with Zen  Zen 1 was a minimum viable product that did its job to keep the company afloat. It really wasn't until Zen 3 and the X3D series where they actually started consistently beating the shit out of Intel at their own game, with Intel obviously doing itself no favors by basically sitting on their laurels and getting hardstuck at 14nm++++++ for the longest time. It's a great comeback for sure, but context matters and it's not something that can be easily replicated if any of the conditions didn't line up (like TSMC incidentally also being in the business of producing 3D Vcache). Nvidia isn't Intel.",Positive
AMD,"It absolutely does lmao thats cope, Every modern high end game is built AND designed around the next gen consoles, aka an amd chip. Switch is not only a minority as most games on pc are NOT switch ports (rather the opposite), but also the switch is an arm, so even if it was the case it wouldnt even give an advantage to nvidia gpu.  desktop pc are a complete oversight for game developping, most devs do not design nor build and not even sometimes optimize their game them",Neutral
AMD,"Switch 2 is irrelevant for the conversation, it didn't catch up to new consoles. Switch 2 AAA games(outside of Nintendo's own) will remain either as ports of old games or handcrafted Switch 2 versions in order to adjust to its shit specs.

With the 9060 XT (16G) at the 369€ MSRP and most custom models around 400€, paying 450 for a 16% faster RX 7800 XT does make sense.

AMD,"Yeah, that's butt ugly.",Neutral
AMD,"Can only recommend it, was really easy to build!",Positive
AMD,"Yeah i really like it! Excellent airflow, easy to build in, good price what do you want more? And no fishtank like 90% these days.",Positive
AMD,Thank you very much! Yeah i changed the Rgb already a bit it was the startup config of the fans. https://imgur.com/a/uwGhcvl#89DwRkZ,Positive
AMD,For CPUs they are. They're way behind with their GPUs.,Negative
AMD,I don't think you can buy them. Maybe direct from Lian Li.,Neutral
AMD,"Glad its useful, for the fans i used 2x120mm at the bottom and also a 120mm as exhaust (140 could be to big) The top ones from the AIO are 2x140mm. (I say this because others stated that a 140mm as rear fan has not much room, also at the bottom with water cooling mode)",Neutral
AMD,"What really? I dont know, maybe we both wanted a nice machine!",Neutral
AMD,thanks!,Positive
AMD,True but on a good way. And if you look at raw price to fps ratio they nail NVIDIA.,Positive
AMD,"good to know. i won’t be doing water cooling at all. 2 intake at the bottom, as you have, plus 2 exhaust at the top. all 120 to be sure",Neutral
AMD,"Not with the latest generation they don't. They're pretty much equal at entry-mid level in price to FPS. They're behind on RT still, but are catching up. Their previous generation was actually better than Nvidia in price to FPS but that was only in raw rasterization. Nvidia GPUs are also significantly better for productivity.",Positive
AMD,"I have not seen a full Wraith with a CPU for a while now, nor can I see I see Spires very often, seems all I see are the Stealth which was always a poor cooler. With the price of decent coolers now being so low, I would rather see the chips solid without a cooler a small price reduction.",Negative
AMD,"It's a shame they're discontinuing the Spire and not the Stealth, that's a slightly better cooler for the current crop of lower end AMD stuff. But I understand the stealth is much cheaper to build and ship out, it's just that it was always borderline e-waste :-/",Negative
AMD,"Without competition, amd is doing the exact same shit Intel did with their stock coolers.   Remember, amd is not your friend.",Negative
AMD,"I've used the same Wraith Prism on a 2700X, 5600, and now a 5700X3D. It's served me well.",Positive
AMD,"i didnt know that they even still put coolers in their cpus since all the am5 cpu box pics looked too thin to include one. I havnt looked deep at am5 since im waiting for at least 2nd gen am6 till i upgrade again and honestly thought that they stopped including them after am4.   Every am4 chip iv bought iv gotten the prism, or the original wraith with the r1700, and just thought it was the standard and that the spire and stealth were phased out after am3, its not like i was going to research it further for worse heatsinks but looking at them now the spire and stealth were only am4/5",Negative
AMD,I gave my Wraith Prism away. A Hyper 212 was $20 and performed much better than it.,Positive
AMD,I still use my wraith prism. It is so awesome for a stock cooler,Positive
AMD,"I think more lower end processors should come with them. Basically all Ryzen 5’s other than maybe those with 3d cache. The 5800xt however does not need a wraith prism and should really be cooled by a better cooler. I think adjustments being made are a good thing, but it should be both give and take, not just taking away stock coolers.",Neutral
AMD,Does anyone know who builds the coolers?,Neutral
AMD,I had a wraith prism on my 2700x. Was a good looking and decent cooler.,Positive
AMD,"AMD's box coolers used to be a big deal back in the early days of Ryzen, but thankfully better aftermarket coolers can be had for dirt cheap these days so I can see why they're being discontinued. There is still an argument about saving money by not needing to buy a cooler in the first place, but with how much you're already spending on a brand new PC are you really that bothered by another $20-30?",Neutral
AMD,I don’t know it still came with anything. I thought AM4 was the end of them outside of stealth coming with the R5 cpus. I’m clearly out of the loop.,Neutral
AMD,"prism, like one of the best ones",Positive
AMD,"I guess my main problem with this is how unstable the market has been for entry-level coolers.  For example, right now in Canada here are the cheapest regular price AM5 coolers I can easily get:   \-Newegg.ca: ""JONSBO CR1400"" for $42 CDN   \-Memory Express: Arctic Cooling FREEZER 7 X CO $34.99 CDN   \-Canada Computers: DeepCool GAMMAXX AG400 $24.99 CDN   \-Amazon.ca: Vetroo V3 $19.99 CDN  (Not counting any of the Hyper 212s currently on sale)  Like if someone puts together a build guide for a budget PC, whatever great value cooler they name is a crapshoot whether or not you're going to be able to buy it here. It was insanely bad during COVID, and the current global trade situation is probably not going to help in the long run.  My secondary problem with this is that I always thought the Wraith Prism was super cool with some of the best lighting effects I've ever seen, a good cooler design for its small package... it would have been cool to see AMD/CoolerMaster to develop it a little more. Oh well. I least I have a spare one, waiting for a good excuse to be cycled back into operation",Neutral
AMD,"Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO, under $50 and one of the best air coolers on the market.",Positive
AMD,"I think it's good. Those stock coolers, although not terrible like the ones Intel had, weren't good. If they can decrease the price of the boxed processor by 5-10$, then a 15-20$ cooler from Amazon will be a much better choice for 99% of people building a pc.  It also makes sense marketing wise. If someone who doesn't know much about cpus and coolers buys an amd cpu and uses the stock cooler, he will complain about the high temps / loud noise. This won't happen if he instead just buys a way better cooler for like 5-10$ more.",Positive
AMD,"They're getting rid of the two better ones but keeping the worst one lolol. I have used all 3, the prism and spire are better than the stealth.  In one case, the stealth just did the bare, bare minimum for a R5 5600x and I needed to buy an aftermarket cooler. In another rig I'm using a prism for an R5 5600  and it does an amazing job believe it or not lol",Negative
AMD,"You can get a decent cooler for so cheap nowadays, is amd still going to package with some CPUs or going the way of the dodo. Stock coolers do a good job for the majority of folks",Positive
AMD,"Sucks for those real tight on cash but oh well, the aftermarket cooler space is great anyway considering effective tower ones are still rather cheap, like 50AUD, 30USD is getting you a dual tower. And you can still go cheaper with a single tower that's still gonna beat a stock cooler and most Ryzen users probably already have a cooler so most models won't need them and the poor coolers will be e-waste or if they're lucky sold off on some marketplace cheaply lmao.   Of course it's good if AMD keeps some CPUs to have a stock cooler, and I'd imagine in more mass purchase scenarios it could be useful.",Positive
AMD,i saw the 9600 has a wraith included in it... anyone know how it performs? wanted to see tests if it was enough for certain uses,Neutral
AMD,No problem. Just get whatever Thermalright makes. No big cost.,Neutral
AMD,I think I have 3 or 4 Wraith Prisms...  I use 2 on my old Tyan S2927 Board (Dual Opteron) and also 1 for my Athlon X2 5200+ EE. They do wonderful on chips that are under 90W TDP.,Neutral
AMD,"I bought 2 wraith prism and 1 Wraith Max they're good cpu coolers kept my FX, Athlon 860K, and 3900X systems cool",Positive
AMD,Still installing them on AM4 paired with 5700x3d (prisms) along with some AM5 builds as they are honestly one of the best looking and quiet stock coolers that more than handled the tasks.,Positive
AMD,"Also, AM5 is backwards-compatible with AM4 coolers and, since many AM4 owners are upgrading, or more likely to upgrade, to AM5, therefore reusing their coolers, bundling a cooler doesn't make much sense now (especially the Stealth, which I promptly replaced it with a Deepcool Gammaxx 400 because my 3600 was reaching 85º with that thing).   >I would rather see the chips solid without a cooler a small price reduction.  But will they really reduce the price?",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, 20 bucks gets you a proper tower cooler.",Neutral
AMD,"It's funny how the ""Stealth"" was the fucking loudest fan ever lol",Negative
AMD,Some years back you could buy TRAY variants of the CPUs that had no coolers.   It is just an issue with warranty because those are supposed to go in bulk to system builders so they don't have the usual 3 year warranty. If you are in the EU you still get the 2 years EU warranty which is fine (either you have a dud and it won#t take 2 years till you have issues or its fine and an extra year won't do much).  Nowadays those TRAY variants seem to not be available to the public anymore. Or all of the vendors I checked just stopped selling them.,Negative
AMD,Stealth was more than sufficient for early Ryzens. I had one for my 1600 and it did it's job adequately.,Positive
AMD,"Wraith prism were made by coolermaster, pretty good too. Shame.",Positive
AMD,"Best option would be to have an option of buying it with the cooler or not, but that would be a logistical nightmare so it's either this or continuous e-waste which I'm against. My stock cooler is just gathering dust and will eventually end up in a landfil.",Negative
AMD,I always find it funny when people are like i know nvidia is better than amd and even for the same price i ll go amd because i dont wanna give my money to greedvidia ... acting like amd is running a charity,Negative
AMD,"No corporation is your friend, especially private, for profit ones.   They only care about quarterly profits. Exclusively. That’s it. If they get that by being nice to you, then sure, they’ll be nice. But the second they make more money by screwing you, they absolutely will.   It’s funny, because if this were an individual human, we would call that person a narcissist. But with corporations, we’re supposed to *expect* them to screw us",Negative
AMD,"lmao if I'm not wrong, back when the 3600 released with no competition from intel their prices were like $300.",Neutral
AMD,"Same here, the old prism with vapour chamber (Ryzen 1000 & 2000) has no problem cooling my 5700x3d.",Neutral
AMD,Yea AMD introduced them with the 2000 Ryzen series. Like you said before that there was just the original Wraith and the older square coolers from AM3(+).,Neutral
AMD,"If they lower prices by 20-30USD (depending on the cooler that came with it) I think most people would be fine with it. I bet a lot of people that assemble their own PCs change that default cooler on the higher SKUs anyways, so a bit less cost would be nice.  And I agree, give all the 65W CPUs the spire and they would be more than fine. Stealth sucks and should be discontinued, even 65W CPUs are running 95°C with it.",Positive
AMD,"Once upon a time I read the ODM was Cooler Master, but don't quote me on that.",Neutral
AMD,I think it was cooler master,Neutral
AMD,"Even the Stealth was a beefy looking cooler compared to the small, stock coolers with 70mm fans that came with pre Ryzen AM3 CPUs.",Neutral

AMD,"Seriously, my Freezer 36 keeps my 5700x under 60c no problem",Negative
AMD,"£16 gets you a proper tower cooler, a tube of thermal compound instead of a tiny sachet and best of all, a digital screen for displaying thermals.Saves me having to setup a separate small screen(even an old smartphone can be used) for metrics and figuring out where the most aesthetically place is to put it inside the case.",Neutral
AMD,"The Stealth was alright for the couple of months I used it on my R5 3600, but not out of the box. The stock fan curve had an annoying tendency for the fan speed to ramp up and down. Making the fan curve less steep reduced how annoying it was drastically.",Negative
AMD,"Depends on the location I guess, but most stores in my country  sells tray versions of AMD CPUs. They have a small stock of CPUs with boxes, but most stock usually are tray versions.",Neutral
AMD,"Aliexpress and other marketplaces are the places to look for tray CPUs, still going strong",Positive
AMD,">Some years back you could buy TRAY variants of the CPUs that had no coolers.  I bought a R7 7700 for my test-bench in May as Tray version, just the cpu in that plastic holder.  >If you are in the EU you still get the 2 years EU warranty which is fine  I'm in the EU and I got it with 3 years warranty, Monster Hunter Wilds game came with it too.  There are plenty of shops selling Tray/Oem version from the cheapest 8400F all the way to the 9950X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"In Chinese markets TRAY variant CPUs are still readily available, provided that you put a bit of effort searching for it. We also tend to buy motherboard and CPU in a set which has a small price reduction, and they let you select TRAY variant for another usually 100CNY (roughly $13) reduction.  And we still a 3-year warranty if the TRAY seller is still running and you have your records. If they go down there is still a chance in legal aspect too.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, in Germany you can buy a tray version of the Ryzen 7700 for 190€. The price was around 200 for more than a year already.",Neutral
AMD,Many people use the stock cooler though. They're pretty good if you're not going to do anything crazy with it.,Positive
AMD,"For many AMD CPUs there is the option to buy the boxed (with cooler) or tray (without cooler) version, atleast in my region/my favourite e-/retailers.",Neutral
AMD,There is a big difference at least right now between nvidia practices and AMD. So people will go with AMD when they clearly see that nvidia is very evil in comparison.  What you might be eluding to but worded it very wrongly is that people start idolising corporations and celebs/people in high positions. Which is wrong to do.  One needs to remember is that big corporations are never your friend. However if there is business you must do with one then do it with the least evil one.  Although with AMD(so far) is that they make stupid decisions rather than outright being evil like Intel has and nvidia is. However in due time AMD growing will eventually start doing same things. So one has to always be careful with big corporations and never side with any of them to a great extent.,Negative
AMD,Show me one person who acts that way.,Negative
AMD,intel was very competitive at the time and 3600 was 199$ so you re wrong on both statements,Neutral
AMD,"Intel 10th gen was still competitive back when the Ryzen 3000 series released. It was only after with Rocket Lake where Intel took a step back on the CPU front (as rocket lake decreased core counts specifically on the top end, and the rest of the stack didn't change much. 11th gen's saving grace was updated pci-e and that tiger lakes igpu made intel igpu not garbage)  the 3600 was popular because it was priced very well. intels competitor to that (the i5-10400) would come out much later.",Neutral
AMD,$20-30 price decrease on a $10-15 retail price cooler would be wild. They probably pay $2 or less for the cooler. Where they are really saving money is shipping costs being able to ship the processors more densely packed.,Neutral
AMD,"If they lower prices by 20-30USD      they will not lower the price lmao      Its a company, they love money and they take all the money they can get.",Negative
AMD,"I know they made prism coolers, but I'm not sure about the spire or stealth.",Neutral
AMD,For £16? No way!,Neutral
AMD,"I'm still using a Wraith Max, it's great.",Positive
AMD,They're really not good at all. They're *adequate*.  And they are no longer *adequate* for the TDP that CPU's have reached.  Aftermarket coolers have always been a necessity for anything outside of spreadsheeting and internet browsing.,Negative
AMD,Be it stupid decision or not . Custommer should look for his own interests not adopt the mentality of lets go for the underdog becoz i think x company is badall corporation are bad its just that amd isnt leading the market . Let mr give u an exemple when i bought my 7900xt  till today amd isnt proposikg any upscaler of the level of xess . They did shrunk their drivers team ... u may judge its a stupid decision i  see it as forcing u to go buy new gpu to get new fsatuews that u can get a lite version of those jf they wanted . So they re going the same nvidia road in the end u should go for the better product when the price is same or close enough . Then its up to amd to fjx their stupidity if they do care abt their share and inovate .,Negative
AMD,"The prism has a solid copper plate and heatpipes I bet you its a lot more than $2 that AMD pays for one. I was only talking about the higher end SKUs that had a cooler, not the CPUs coming with the stealth.  All the tests I have seen the prism was a fine cooler, keep in mind it is also very low profile. It surely isn't a fit for a 150+W CPU or if you wanna OC, but for a 105W CPU it is decent.  I.e. the Silverstone Krypton KR01: costs 21€ here and is worse than the prism.   An ARCTIC Freezer 8A CO is 17€ and about the cheapest tower cooler you can get that is decent for its price. But I wouldn't change a wraith for that because you wouldn't gain much but a bit more silence in prolonged high stress scenarios.   There is a reason the prism goes for like $40, it IS one of the best flat coolers, its just most people don't need that.",Neutral
AMD,Shop online and its there right in front of you.,Neutral
AMD,Tdp’s have been pretty stable or even going down. The problem now is that the dye size is so small and the heat is so concentrated in one small area that even with an IHS it’s not able to transfer the heat as effectively as in the past with a larger die.,Neutral
AMD,A ton of OEMs use the stock coolers on their low-mid range systems aimed at gaming as well.   There's always someone willing to spend $20 on an extra 5% performance and even more people willing to save $20 to lose 10% off advertised boost or whatnot it seems,Neutral
AMD,"You made the claim, you have to back it up with a source.  If you can't do that, or don't want too, then don't make a fool of yourself by making a claim you can't back up with evidence in the first place.",Negative
AMD,"That’s fair, the prism does have copper and would be worth more than the spire. I still gotta believe manufacturing costs would be in the $10-15 range. It’s also kind of in a weird spot in terms of height. It’s not particularly low profile so won’t fit in most Itx cases, but isn’t as big a standard basic tower cooler.",Neutral

AMD,"I disagree. Computer parts are becoming ever more efficient and drawing fewer and fewer watts. It’s far more likely that mobile ships will start to take over the low end and medium range Desktop chips. Sooooo much more energy efficient and it decreases sku count for what they need to manufacture and when paired with even a wraith stealth, the chips can boost higher in a desktop form factor due to much better cooling.",Neutral

AMD,"I did say high-end. There's always a divergent path for HEDT where they don't look at maximising EE like for mobile or datacenter/SC cluster use.

So who knows what form it could take.  It's all just imaginationland when looking out that far heh.  ETA: And besides that, as density goes up so does power use, moors law doesn't scale like that lol. We get more compute but it's not free... Computers are using more electricity than ever. Home computers used to use like less than 20W. They're more efficient now to be sure and we can pull a lot of performance from 20W but that's not what they want to sell us.

If they did a 32gb version of the 9060XT and 9070XT im sure a bunch of consumers would buy it for at home AI work... thats the next market... because WHO wants to let big corporations control everything you do with AI? And even have to PAY them for it anytime you want to do something? Hell no. The future is running AI locally and for that you need AT LEAST 24gb of vram. Whoever provides consumers with 32gb vram for AI work for reasonable prices first gets a lot of sales. And lets be real, 16gb of GDDR6 costs like 35$ at most. So they could sell a 32gb 9060XT-9070XT for 50$ more than the normal version and still make a profit... and it would make nvidia mad as hell... because it would make it look like the greedy bastards they are to every gamer on the planet.

AMD,The 9070GRE is a cut down of the 9070. So it should be along the lines of the low end of the 9070 cards,Neutral
AMD,"Such an odd one. The gre was less than the xt for the 7900xt, better than the 7800xt  But now that we already have a card that's non xt, the gre is less than that? Such an odd place to sit. But I guess there's far more room between the 9060xt and 9070 than there is between the 9070 and xt",Neutral
AMD,If it delivers it'll be a good gpu for $450,Positive
AMD,$400 to crush NVIDIA,Neutral
AMD,If it's in the $400 range I would definitely buy it!,Neutral
AMD,The 7900 gre (which is the performance equivalent to the 9070 gre) is 25% faster than the 9060 XT. It's not a negligible gap. The 9070 GRE with more memory would be maybe 30% faster in cases where it was previously memory limited.  It makes sense as a card. The gap between 9070 and 9060 XT is too large.,Neutral
AMD,The 12GB version only had a 192 bit memory interface due to the left out memory chips. Maybe the 16GB performs better.,Neutral
AMD,"If performance is close to a 9060XT, then it's just a way to bin faulty 9070XT/9070 dies that didn't make the cut",Negative

AMD,I see. So it's between 9070 and 9060xt?,Neutral
AMD,"The 9070 is already 10% cut down from the full chip. I doubt they have that many bad chips for the GRE, and now with them also getting 16GB, the only real manufacturing price savings are also gone.",Negative
AMD,"maybe they want to keep the price of the 9070 up, so they push the 16GB gre between there so the don't have to price drop the original model.",Neutral
AMD,Would have loved to see the 9070 GRE 12GB if that means it could have been cheaper than 9070 GRE 16GB.  Don't really need 16GB of vram unless I am paying more than let's say ~$450  And then with pricing looks like this in mind:  9060 xt 16GB ~$350  9070 GRE 12GB ~$450  9070 GRE 16GB ~$525  9070 ~$600   9070 XT ~$700   I know 9070 and 9070 XT were supposed to be $50 lower... but reality is different,Neutral

AMD,"We don't know, but just expect its gonna be cheaper than the 9070 unless the VRAM pushes it up. Its more about demand I think, and if there is suppy. Ultimately the smartest thing to do when buying a GPU is to wait a while after launch to see how prices look.",Neutral
AMD,"Looking at the European prices where the 9070XT is already closing into 630-650€ territory while the 9070 is barely going below 600€, I can totally see an scenario where the 9070 is discontinued and all the cut-down SKUs (both 9070-worthy chips and all of them that are too defective to make a 9070) are suddenly turned a 9070 GRE 16GB for 480-500€ (around $450 in the US) to undercut the 5070 with a similar performance.",Neutral
AMD,Ok but they can only charge what people are willing to pay for it. It's lower class than a 9070 so people won't pay the same as a 9070,Negative
AMD,"I'm not sure who you watched but the 25% figure comes from Tech Power Up who do frequently test their cards to reflect any changes and they're reputed.   So, no. It's not gonna increase performance by 30% but it doesn't have to. It's just to alleviate the cases where a lack of memory is a bottleneck.",Neutral

AMD,I was there in that 2 hour microcenter line for msrp pricing… I was there…,Neutral
AMD,"That MSRP was just the launch price, sold out in a day.  I'll be surprised if any 9070 xt gets much below $700.",Neutral
AMD,"For many it would be price. In my area the ASUS 9070/xt are more consistently sold at MSRP and even their ASUS TUF version goes on sale every now and then close to MSRP.  In terms of performance the cards are good as well. So when people see MSRP card it will sell.  Yes their practices with their warranties and such have been awful in recent years. But ASUS seem to be more aware of taking advantage of different regions in terms of putting their shit on sale earlier than others and more often.  A lot of people wont be aware of ASUS customer services. Also in regions where people take their warranty claims to the retailer very rarely get hands on experience with ASUS themselves as retailers handle it. In those cases the customer wont care as they wont have the same shitty experience as others for an example.  I am sure XFX, powercolour etc are selling well in other regions but you rarely see sales on their models in my region. They arent taking good advantage of different markets in different areas as well as ASUS does.  On top of that ASUS knows how to play the market. In terms of how they sell their products in different regions differently does give them an upper hand. Also cause they are so big they can at times take a small hit just to get more customers on their side for future products. ASUS seems to always make sure to have good availability for their products(from my experience observing the market here), some companies dont adapt to each individual market or are slow to do it.  Also they will clearly have a white version to sell that will be just a bit cheaper than other white versions and those who want white model will get the cheapest one. ASUS clearly have good sale numbers for 9070/xt hence the new white version to take sales away from other brands white cards that are all overpriced too much in most regions.  Im no fan of any company and not defending ASUS just saying why you see them have success even with the bad practices they have.",Positive
AMD,Or powercolor or Sapphire,Neutral
AMD,"Price, looks, availability. At least in the US, XFX cards have had some of the highest prices for AMD partners cards this gen. Which is odd as they use to be known for having very affordable cards the last 2 gens.",Neutral

It was a $250 motherboard and unfortunately the issue didn’t appear until it was too late to return the board. I bought an OEM CPU and the vendor opted to replace that. Once I got it, everything booted fine and has been working alright.  I am of course nervous I’ll start to get issues again.

In the case I linked it could be user error and such, I'm not an expert nor have I done some thorough investigation. But it appears that ASRock is either making the issue worse than other board makers, or they're just extremely unlucky.  All I know is that when it's an NVIDIA card that burns, it's NVIDIA's fault. When it's an AMD card that burns it's PCI-SIG's or the AIB's fault. When it's an Intel CPU overvolting itself, it's Intel's fault. When it's an AMD CPU becoming a firework, it's the motherboard vendor's fault.  I think if the design is so trash that the connector melts itself and you allow partners to use it, it's AMD/NVIDIA's fault. And if the board maker is not enforced to strict settings and BIOS behavior and they make stuff break, then it's AMD/NVIDIA/Intel's fault for allowing it to happen. It's really that simple.  As much as I'm all for allowing overclocking and turning off guard rails for advanced users, especially enthusiasts. If you're just plugging stuff in and using a product at stock settings and it's presenting destroyed CPUs and burned connectors in the case of GPUs, then your design is trash and so is your oversight of your partners for your customer's safety and the safety of your products.",Neutral

AMD,"> Dude, you literally just posted one example and that socket on the motherboard had bent pins.   I posted a recent example to illustrate that it happens on other boards too. I can post more if you like. Also I looked at the photos and cannot see any bent pins. [The OP says they cannot see a bent pin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUSROG/comments/1l39mzn/asus_rog_strix_b850_a_gaming_and_9800x3d_my_cpu/mvz68hl/) and it was just the top commenters opinion that a pin was bent based off the photo. It's NOT a fact it's a confirmed bent pin. [To me it looks like debris on a pin](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fevm868ndsy4f1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3024%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D753ffd7e9083ddc5a992de0775e75cc63befb5c8), either from the pin being burned or the debris was stuck there during installation and thus burned when wedged between the CPU and the pins.  > What is happening primarily on Asrock boards is an Asrock problem.  I love you AMD guys, you never read anything I write. I never said it wasn't, hence why I said this:  >""But it appears that **ASRock is either making the issue worse than other board makers**, or they're just extremely unlucky.""  You have a 9800X3D and a 7900 XTX so I already know you can't think impartially and just have your own bias. So I am going to discard your opinion entirely, it's worthless. Have a wonderful day.",Neutral
AMD,"> No, the data is pretty indicative that Asrock boards are a significant outlier for number of destoryed CPU's and it is a safe assumption that avoiding their boards would decrease your chances of having a broken CPU.  I never said anything of the sort to NOT avoid ASRock boards, users should avoid ASRock boards for AM5.   Secondly, never anywhere did I say the incidence was anywhere close on other boards as it is on ASRock boards.  I simply pointed out that this appears to be an AM5 issue in general as the issue has presented itself on other boards and I linked one post as evidence of that and that ASRock has made it worse and present more frequently, evident by what I said here:  > ""But it appears that **ASRock is either making the issue worse than other board makers**, or they're just extremely unlucky.""  It pays to read what I wrote, rather than just take one part of what I said and run with a strawman.  Lastly, it has happened before with ASUS boards beyond the one incident I posted above, [like here where it fried **TWO ASUS boards**.](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/29/amd_ryzen_twice_fails_in/) It's pretty clear there is some sort of AM5 issue, but it appears ASRock's BIOS makes the problem more frequent in incidence.  This issue can present on other boards, it's just more rare. [I also like how you linked a chart that shows it happens on other board makers and then make out like ASRock is only affected?](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fpcdds0rt68xe1.png%3Fwidth%3D1416%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dd32dfa2347d26f864757fcc684081f451ada207f&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=ASRock) (lol).

Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC.

AMD,I wonder why APO isn't just tied to game mode. That way it would work for all games from ADL to ARL.,Negative
AMD,"or just get rid of E cores. I know all the non engineers in here think they are great, but real world they are crap, this is just another in a long line of examples of why intel needs to ditch them.   anyway go ahead and downvoted me becuse being correct in this sub is looked down upon.",Negative
AMD,A few years ago you'd have to tweak the hell out of AMD CPUs to get comparable performance to Intel equivalents. Now the tables have turned.  In either case those who know how to tweak will get top performance not matter the platform.     Kudos,Negative
AMD,Congratulations on getting a CPU that didn’t fry itself.  Consider yourself one of the few lucky ones.,Positive
AMD,"It looks like Intel APO almost completely disables the efficiency cores for the game when you look at the screenshots I posted below with per core activity.  But this performance boost likely cannot just be gained by turning off the efficiency cores in the BIOS yourself I wager, because it would be too simple.",Negative
AMD,How is this doing the game developers work?,Neutral
AMD,"It's updated as far as I know, but not for every platform.  If you're on Arrow Lake you have the new games that were added, but if you're still on Raptor Lake then you only have the original titles.     This sucks because I own BG3, which is one of the new titles they added recently along with Cyberpunk 2077.",Negative
AMD,"They have added a few new games, but it appears you need to have Arrow Lake to be able to apply APO on them which is BS!  They need to have a better system than this.       The DTT driver should be downloadable from Intel, and not from the motherboard manufacturers who cannot be trusted to make the latest version available.",Negative
AMD,The intel software team is pure black magic when they allowed to work on crack.,Neutral
AMD,"Here is a screenshot showing CPU activity across all cores.  This is with HT disabled BTW, and the cooler is an Id FROZN A720.  It looks like the efficiency cores are not engaged in this particular game when APO is enabled.  And Metro Exodus is the only game that I own in the current lineup for the 14900K.  I know they've added some games for Arrow Lake (like Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3) but those games still aren't available yet for the 14900K     [https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/3528x1985q90/923/hh8Guk.png)",Neutral
AMD,"Raptor Lake isn't getting new games for APO.  Which strikes me as greedy, since I'm sure it would work fine. Intel originally said that APO wouldn't work at all on 13th gen, which turned out to be completely false.",Negative
AMD,"When combined with Nova Lake's bLLC, it could give Intel a major edge over AMD's X3D.       And yeah, limiting it to certain games and certain CPUs is a real downer for the technology, so hopefully Intel can find a way to streamline and expand it when Nova Lake launches.",Positive
AMD,"AFAIK, it's recommended to use Balanced mode for proper use of the efficiency cores if you have a Raptor Lake or Arrow Lake CPU",Neutral
AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral
AMD,Or... Just process lasso.,Neutral
AMD,Because it’s optimizations on how it can efficiently use the cpu.,Neutral
AMD,Must the App be downloaded? Or it's automatic after installing the PPM and DTT drivers?,Neutral
AMD,"All of this stuff is super situational. For when it’s supported for my 14th G, I love it.  To call it better than X3D though? That’s a bit much.",Positive
AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.   A Raptor Lake CPU with 8 P cores and no efficiency cores, with 36MB of L3 would perform exceptionally well in games.   But the efficiency cores have their uses as well in highly parallel tasks.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's a pretty cool, yet simple idea. It would be really nice to give users more granular control natively.",Positive
AMD,Are the e cores clustered in order so we would be able to manually achieve this with process lasso?,Neutral
AMD,Why should game devs be automatically expected to specifically optimize their game for specific architectures of Intel's CPUs? It's not on them to do so.,Negative
AMD,You need to download the Intel Application Optimization app from the Windows store,Neutral
AMD,"I never said it was better than X3D, only that it is useful as a foil.       Remember that Nova Lake will have bLLC, which is the answer to X3D.  But in conjunction with APO, it may give Intel the edge and help them regain the gaming crown in the next cycle provided they can streamline and expand the technology.",Positive
AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average. FSR3 is pretty good when modded and can be competitive) so they do have some extremely talented people there. I hope they fund them properly and don't go the AMD route of having Ryzen and Radeon not work together due to pride.",Positive
AMD,"Just  Steam, MSI Afterburner, Windows Security, Nvidia App and my sound card command center",Neutral
AMD,Where to download this APO,Neutral
AMD,Except its THE game devs job to optimize games for multiple cpus and gpus.,Neutral
AMD,It’s literally their job to do so? wtf you talking about?,Negative
AMD,AMD also has Heterogeneous CPUs and even more so ARM cpus.  Devs should start to do this optimizations to schedule the stronger cores.,Neutral
AMD,"Will do, I got a 265K. Performance is already great tbh.",Positive
AMD,I love Intel but with how the company is doing right now I’m in a “I’ll believe it when I see it” type of skepticism.,Neutral
AMD,"Sorry I am making unreasonable requests. Can you test the game with APO on, and a few background tasks ? Like a few browser tabs, a youtube video playing, discord etc ? I am interested in the E-core usage, particularly the spread of E-core usage.   Thanks.",Positive
AMD,"You need to enable it in the BIOS, me ale sure the DTT driver is installed and then download the app from the Windows 11 store",Neutral
AMD,"Which they already do, and are often overworked and underappreciated for.   But sure, it's their fault they didn't optimize the game even more for a subset of already relatively high end CPUs....",Negative
AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative
AMD,That's not simply what APO does.,Neutral
AMD,"You should have the full list of current APO optimized titles, unlike myself which only has the original list LOL!",Neutral
AMD,"Everyone should be skeptical, sure, but I choose to be hopefully optimistic also.",Positive
AMD,"I booted it up again, this time with three Chrome tabs open including one that had an active YouTube video playing.  The efficiency cores were definitely being utilized for the background tasks I believe as I could see a small bit of load going from core to core.

AMD,i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?,Neutral
AMD,Ok…all CPUs include Intel CPUs…I don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"According to Intel, the app is entirely optional. The DTT driver already includes APO, the app is just an interface to control it and disable APO, if needed.",Neutral
AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Neutral
AMD,"Very cool. Cheers Intel! As a 6900XT owner, I use Xess whenever it's available. The DP4A version got very solid once V1.3 hit.  Hopefully more devs implement it.",Positive
AMD,"I like how Intel still support DP4A model. My meteor lake chip gonna love this XeSS2 with FG and LL.  Meanwhile Amd give middle finger to their consumer who don't have radeon 9000 series, FSR4 doesn't works at all on their previous GPU including the flagship rx 7000 series.",Positive
AMD,Did the DP4A version also improve from 1.3 to 2.0?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought it was a mix of both shader model 6.4+ and DP4a, not either or",Neutral
AMD,Okay but why would I want to use that instead of NVIDIA DLSS?,Neutral
AMD,It’s the least you should get after not getting FSR4.,Negative
AMD,You'd use it over FSR if that's available too?,Neutral
AMD,Except you NEVER got acces to the DP4a version tho. Intel cross vendor locked the DP4a path to their igpus and only allowed Shader Model 6.4 version for other gpus.,Neutral
AMD,"I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4.   On Linux they managed to emulate it using the FP16 instruction, which is available on RDNA3, but it seriously impacts performance and introduces 1,5ms of input latency, compared to the 0,5/0,8ms of latency on RDNA4 with hardware FP8.",Negative
AMD,And they expect people who bought previous RDNA to buy more RDNA,Neutral
AMD,Not by a significant amount.,Neutral
AMD,DP4a only relevant for intel igpus as its crpss vendor locked by intel. Other gpus only get the Shader Model 6.4 version.,Neutral
AMD,for the games that dont support DLSS,Neutral
AMD,"If you own a card that doesn't support dlss.   This is an extra option, it doesn't affect your choice to run dlss or not.",Neutral
AMD,10 series cards will benefit from this,Neutral
AMD,It's great news for gpu that can't use dlss because fsr3 is a blurry shitfest.,Positive
AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler). So if I'm not running Xess DP4a then what am I running?,Neutral
AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right? FSR 3.1 is so bad even when compared to Intel XeSS 1.3 DP4A, but Amd refuse to improve it because they want to force people to buy radeon 9000 series.",Negative
AMD,"Amd really all in when it comes to copying Nvidia. Guess what? The more you buy, the more you save!",Positive
AMD,DP4a is cross vendor.   XMX is Arc only.,Neutral
AMD,DLSS is the widely adopted upscaler in the current market. I'd be shocked if a major game in 2025 releases without DLSS at the very least.,Neutral
AMD,1080ti heard no bell,Neutral
AMD,"You run the Shader Model 6.4 version which i stated. There was a discussiona bout DP4a being cross vendor locked but for the life of me i cannot find it again. The article you linked is from 2021, in early 2022 intel cross vendor locked DP4a. The main article of the post clearly states Shader Model 6.4.",Neutral
AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.  I think this also the reason why they never update APO game support again. Obviously optimizing their platform by working directly with game developer is better than doing it by themself.  I really hope we got optimization like this for more titles.",Positive

AMD,"the game is just really latency sensitive, i dont think it will even change in the full release sadly  i kinda wonder what makes the game so demanding on CPUs, the mechanics and physics arent much better compared to older BF (like BF4) that barely use modern CPUs beyond 20 - 30%",Negative
AMD,"Dealing with same issue on a 285k + 5090. dipping to 125 fps curing certain scenarios specifically on the cairo map at point C. MY system should not struggle at all at 1440p to reach 144 fps, but the 285k is getting absolutely destroyed by bf6 and I have no idea what the issue is,",Negative
AMD,"It's not like game runs bad on Intel CPU which has P and E cores, i will be lying if i say that. It's about maximizing CPU performance. CPU demanding game will runs with much higher FPS when it knows which thread should be utilized.    This is why game with APO enable like R6S on i9-14900K at 1080p low settings, it got performance increase up to 100FPS which is massive.",Neutral
AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much. That's why Intel HEDT and AMD's Threadripper aren't of much use in this regard.",Neutral
AMD,"No, that's because and isn't really better for gaming unless you get their x3d variants. Those have a different style of memory that is better for gaming in particular but can underperform when it comes to workload tasks. Idk why 🤷",Negative

AMD,Wouldn't the 300 series actually be Arrow Lake Refresh?,Neutral
AMD,"Videocardz is wrong      This chip will likely be called ""Core Ultra 5 445k"" it's an 8+16 die with bLLC + 4LPe   (Not sure what suffix Intel will use to denote bLLC SKU maybe ""L"")    Ultra 3 has 4P + 4E + 4LPe  Ultra 5 has the 1x 8+16 tile + 4LPE   Ultra 7 has 8+6 P-Cores and 16+8 E-Cores +4LPe   Ultra 9 had 2x 8+16 tiles + 4LPe tile   Ultra 300 series will be reserved for mobile only Panther Lake and/or Arrow Lake Refresh   Ultra 400 will almost certainly be Nova Lake.",Neutral
AMD,I think this competition will tight up alot in the next gen for both intel and AMD.  Intel has had a superior memory controller for awhile now and AMD will finally address this in Zen 6.  AMD has better cache setup with VCache which Intel will finally address in NL.  May the superior arch win!,Positive
AMD,This is pat's work,Positive
AMD,This is normal Nova Lake or the bLLC version? I heard the bLLC version has separate SKUs.,Neutral

AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral

AMD,No different to 12-14th gen then.,Neutral
AMD,"windows pretty much gave up on this and just allows you to set to performance mode, which always tries to grab a P core first.",Neutral
AMD,"Or that I forgot they don't have HT on the newer chips.   To be honest I was meaning 14th gen P and E cores with more cache not the new gen stuff. We know the IPC, memory controller and core speed is enough it's just the cache that makes it fall behind AMD in gaming.",Neutral

AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral

AMD,fym no different they're 50% faster,Negative
AMD,No. ARL architecture is definitely not optimized for latency but hiding memory access which favours multithreading instead of gaming. Hopefully Nova Lake will optimize all the latecy issues with ARL arch and decrease latency to L3 considerably aswell,Negative
AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down. AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help.,Neutral

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Neutral
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper.

AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides. In that case you need stuff like Process Lasso to fix the problem. It doesn't happen very often but when it does it's very annoying.",Negative

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability.

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral
AMD,"> On one hand, this shouldn't cause any thermal and Fmax implications like 3D stacking has created for AMD's chips, however doing this would prob also make the latency hit of increasing L3 capacity worse too.  It is already a non-issue since AMD moved the 3D V-Cache to underneath the compute tile.",Neutral

AMD,Intel managed to run Sandy Bridge's ring bus clock speeds at core clocks which resulted in 30 cycles of L3 latency.   Haswell disaggreated core and ring clocks allowing for additional power savings.   Arrow Lake's L3 latency is 80 cycles with a ring speed of 3.8ghz,Neutral
AMD,"I'd like to see the HEDT X-series come back too, but Intel would have to come up with something that would be competitive in that area.  It's not hard to see why Intel dropped the series when you take a look at the Sapphire Rapids Xeon-W lineup they would have likely been based off of.  I think AMD would also do well to offer something that's a step above the Ryzen lineup, rather than a leap above it like the current Threadrippers.",Neutral

AMD,Maybe that is your experience.  Neverthelesss if you compare most gamers who switched to 9800x3D they report a significantly noticeable uplift in fps and 0.1 fps. Maybe a negligible few reported a decrease. And this has very likely nothing to do with the x3D CPU but other causes.,Neutral
AMD,"Ah you’re missing the final piece. As far as i’m aware this pretty much requires controlling the OS as well (or at least solid OS support). Consoles get their own custom operating system, Apple built a new version of MacOS for M chips. Intel and AMD though don’t control windows.",Neutral

AMD,"Intel needs something decent because AMD has taken a page out of intel (up to gen7) playbook, same cores no changes. Intel now provides more cores but it's the 100% core increase Vs AMD 50% and bLLC that should shake things up, hopefully they keep the temperature down as I don't want to have to replace case and get a 360mm rad just to not throttle, and not ever again do a 13th and 14th gen degradation show.

Hopefully intel i5 has 12P cores and i7 18-20P cores that would be nice to have",Neutral
AMD,"bLLC is just a big-ass L3$ and since Intel does equal L3 slices per coherent ring stop, it'll be 6\*12 or 12\*12 with each slice doubling or quadrupling. The rumor is 144MB so quadrupled per slice, probably 2x ways and 2x sets to keep L3 latency under control.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel and AMD have effectively the same client L3 strategy. It's only allocated local to one compute die. Intel just doesn't have any multi-compute die parts till NVL.   > Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3  8+16 is one tile, in regardless of how much cache they attach to it",Neutral
AMD,It is a massive issue for amd. You're voltage limited like crazy as electron migration kills the 3D cache really fucking fast. 1.3V is already dangerous voltage for the cache.,Negative
AMD,"I still think there's a slight impact (the 9800x3d only boosts up to 5.2GHz vs the 5.5GHz of the 9700x), but compared to Zen 4, the issue does seem to have been lessened, yes.   And even with Zen 4, the Fmax benefit from not using 3D V-cache using comparable skus was also only single digits anyways.",Neutral
AMD,"Adamantium was always rumored to be an additional L4 cache IIRC, and what Intel appears to be doing with NVL is just adding more L3 (even though ig Intel is calling their old L3 the new L4 cache? lol).   I don't think Intel can also build out Foveros-Direct at scale just yet, considering they are having problems launching it for just CLF too.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm an e-core hater but arrow lake e-cores are really performant and make up for the loss of HT. arl/nvl 4+8 would wildly beat 6c12t adl/rpl.  HT was always a fallacy anyway.

I would much rather pin main-thread to best p-core in a dedicated fashion and let the other cores handle sub threads. Much better 1% lows if we optimize for arrow lake properly (still doesn't hold a candle to 9800X3D with HT disabled though).",Negative

AMD,"Sooo a few months ago, I helped a buddy of mine troubleshoot a black screen issue on his newly built 9800X3D and RTX 5090 rig, a fairly common issue with Nvidia’s latest GPUs.  While working on his PC, I'd notice a series of odd and random hiccups. For example, double clicking a window to maximize it would cause micro freezes. His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced. Basically, all the little things you need to do to get the X3D chip to play nice and left.  But man... I do not want to ever be on an AMD system.",Neutral

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience. I'm speaking from experience since I also have a fully tuned 9950x3D/5090 on my testbench. For productivity task Intel feels much better to use as well. I feel like Intel is just better optimized for Windows and Productivity too.",Positive

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral

AMD,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.  The whole experience is proving to be awful, time consuming, feels like it should be illegal and has completely put me off ever using Intel again, or recommending it to anyone I help spec builds for.",Negative

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.

Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly.

AMD,"u/TheCupaCupa Great to hear it fixed itself! If it happens again, trying Turbo off sounds like a good plan.",Positive
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Neutral
AMD,Relax 😅 and follow this:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005609/processors.html,Neutral
AMD,"Thank you for the reply. Sadly asrock doesn’t have a QVL for nvme drives in U.2 form factor or enterprise grade drives, just m.2. Let alone a QVL for VROC support. Looks like I’ll be the test subject for this.",Negative
AMD,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology. My phone is 4 years old and was absolutely not capable (Samsung S20+)",Negative

AMD,"LPCAMM2 and CAMM2 are not the same thing, CAMM2 utilizes the same DDR modules as conventional DIMMs, LPCAMM2 it for laptops and it utilizes LPDDR modules, you don't want LPDDR memory on your desktop, it has awful timings/latency.",Negative
AMD,">Faster DDR5 DRAM chips are coming, even at high capacities, but existing DIMM standard is a bottleneck due to signal degradation.   Intel is already running MRDIMMs at 8800 MT/s with 12800 MT/s planned on a conventional DIMM socket. The DIMM format can handle the frequency, but bottleneck is the DRAM itself, so MRDIMMs basically RAID two 4400 MT/s memories (and in future 6400 MT/s) on a single DIMM to get around the the limited speed of the DRAM. Signal integrity is evidently not a problem past 10 GT/s, so don't expect CAMM to suddenly unlock more performance from existing DDR5 DRAMs or to make the performance hit from multiple modules dramatically smaller (although it may help somewhat).   >Does that mean it would be prudent to wait a bit with new MoBos purchase ?   IMO no, at least not with DDR5. We will see if DDR6 at >12 GT/s runs into issues with DIMM, but that is still a ways off.    >LP/CAMM2 apparently brings many other benefits, not just frequency bump. It shoudl be compatible with LP/DDR6, allow line-load-reducing, clk regen ( like CUDIMM), MRDIMM data rate doubling (friggin cool!), registering, ECC etcetc   The format allows those memory types, but putting a CAMM with LPDDR into a system that doesn't support LPDDR is not going to work. Similarly to DIMM, the CPU still has to support a feature, so don't expect things like MRDIMMs to suddenly work on consumer hardware.",Neutral
AMD,"We need more speed, further, faster, farther. Where is the easy button for all this?",Negative
AMD,"I'm at Computex right now talking with both motherboard makers and memory makers. At this point, they're not seeing a ton of demand for CAMM2 modules in the enthusiast space, so I don't think this year will be the year for mainstream adoption. I could see adoption picking up for laptops and for full systems (see the ASUS TUF T500 that launched a couple days ago).   I don't have a crystal ball, but I'd almost think the major transition will happen with DDR6 - at this point, if you have DDR5 in a DIMM already and are upgrading your rig while reusing the same DDR5... why would you re-buy it as CAMM2?",Neutral
AMD,">you don't want LPDDR memory on your desktop, it has awful timings/latency.  Ryzen AI Max uses LPDDR5 and achieves 256GB/s memory bandwidth vs 100GB/s at most for 2-channel DDR5 on regular PC.  Apple M4 is the same. M4 Pro is 400GB/s and M4 Max is 540GB/s. Ultra is 800GB/s reaching recent GPU speed.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, this is unfortunately the big problem.. Convincing mobo makers to switch.  I think it will have to start with Laptops right? And it'll have to come from consumers not wanting normal SODIMMs or soldered RAM.. So maybe a few years yet :( .",Negative

AMD,I'm having issues since I enabled S200 boost mode. I can't seem to get my RAM to run stable without xmp. If I run both RAM settings and boost mode I hard crash at random. What RAM settings do you guys use when using boost mode?,Negative
AMD,"Yes for xtu if 200s is off, but once 200s boost is active, xtu doesn't let you do anything. No undervolting, no multiplier. Even if vmd and undervolt protection is off, xtu wom't let you. 200s boost is useless, just use performance intel bios setting, xpm profile and undervolt in xtu amd get a bigger boost than 200s boost.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, 200s boost is trash. I had better performance with an undervolting 0 OC, than no possible undervolting with XTU. The 265k sees no benifit from this. I disabled it, undervolted, and added 53x and 47x and have better perf.",Negative
AMD,"Sigh, I reverted to old bios only allow me to use xtu.",Neutral
AMD,"200s boost is basically Intel sanctioned overclocking that does not void your warranty. Ive enabled the feature, and I'm pretty happy with how much my ram latency dropped (9.6ns) and how I'm also getting improved 1% lows as a result.   You are free to disable it, over clock and tune until your heart's content. But calling it useless is a bit of a stretch.",Positive
AMD,Are you able to undervolt using xtu even 200s boost is disabled?,Neutral
AMD,"Rumors and alleged hardware id captures suggest that yes, more discrete GPU models are coming.  It appears that Intel has cancelled the higher end Battlemage Xe2 GPUs though, which considering the performance of the B580, it's a shame if we don't get to see big Battlemage.      But Celestial is allegedly part of the tile set for the upcoming Panther Lake chips as Xe3 cores, and Druid (Xe4) is supposedly pretty far along in production if not close to being finished.

AMD,* I see similarities between the engineering philosophy of Intel GPU's to AMD  Bro can share me some of your weed ?,Neutral
AMD,Given that Tan has said that he believes in you need to ship products to learn from them.  I don't see him canceling many chip programs that have future product development needs.  Intel needs ship products to get people into their eco system and GPU development is needed for AI chip development.  Either way I would not expect much rumors until closer to Thursday and Intel announces earnings.,Neutral
AMD,"In the land of HPC, AI workloads, GPU is king. If they stop making GPU then they stop being relevant. They already goofed up big time by not making GPU last two decades. If they deprioritise dGPU now then they will never be able to catch up.",Negative
AMD,"I do hope Intel continues.  Intel HAS to develop shaders and tensors for iGPU and NPUs anyway. Might as well get more out of it by releasing dGPU cards as well.  Nvidia completely abandoned the low end of the market. It's likely a low margin product, but with high volumes. The market used to be mostly sub 300 € GPUs.  As for mid tier and high tier card, Nvidia sells their VRAM like it's made of money, and AMD is hopelessly behind in software. Words can't describe how bad AMD is at accelerating anything.   Give how quickly Intel figured out driver, I am more hopeful Intel can figure out an acceleration stack to make use of their NPU units.",Neutral
AMD,"My best is they'll slim down the division and not release discrete cards. They need to keep the r and d up to make their igpu competitive.   Intel need to save money first and foremost, so I would think layoffs are coming fairly soon",Neutral
AMD,"I hope they keep trying. While not perfect (of course)  , they had good showing with ""only"" 2 gens of products. But they really need to fix gpu usage, which seems kind of low right now. They would need to fix this before launching high end gpus, because right now going larger doesn't seem to scale very well for their arch.",Positive

AMD,"Clearly,  As we know, network administrators pass their time by playing video games on server farms they manage.",Neutral
AMD,"He mostly means, Mobileye etc. Not GPU's... Though that might not also make the cut.  I think new CEO is more likely to split the foundry than to cut GPU's given their importance in AI. I don't think either of these is going to happen.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, but GPUs and WiFi chips are both part of the intel package, even if they dropped discrete gpus they still need to develop igpus and ai accelerators, so it's probably not actually that big of a cost",Neutral
