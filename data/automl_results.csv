Intel,it's about time they brought back the Turbo button,Neutral
Intel,"It does intrigue me when Nvidia does it, theres lots of pushback, when Intel do it it's fine   Intel have also used it for marketing slides against AMD without FG",Positive
Intel,"And lsfg can do 20x   It isn't the same as regular FPS, and I dislike how they frame it like that in the title",Neutral
Intel,"call it what it is, its a smoothing technique not a frame multiplier",Negative
Intel,Can't even read it because it requires either accepting the tracking cookies or paying for the subscription so basically it's behind the paywall.,Negative
Intel,"I don’t understand frame generation, it’s always feels sloppy and laggy. I have never encountered a game where it was beneficial. I have 144hz monitor, so if generate from 60, or 30, it’s all shit. If generate from 144 fps, to 300, it’s looks better, but feels much worse.   “300 000 000 fps by the press if a button, but it still feels like 30”",Negative
Intel,The downside is a game has to support XeSS 2. That's an extremely short list!,Negative
Intel,people spend hundreds on a high end 1ms response monitor then turn on framegen and add back like 100ms of delay like gg,Neutral
Intel,"downvoted due to referring as simply ""3x FPS"".",Neutral
Intel,3x the frames but they all suck!,Neutral
Intel,"""internet you will disagree you will piss and moan in the comments all day you will cry about it scream about it go on Twitter and write it no no no and then you go to buy your Nvidia card..."" Gordon  There are several camps, ""Nvidia is marketing fg/mfg as ""performance"" which upsets people""  ""Those features are going to cause devs to stop optimizing (because somehow although nvidia/amd recommend \~60fps first), devs are going to push 35fps to 140"" Average r/pcmasterrace  or ""I hated because its hardware locked, I deserve access to it because I bought nvidia all my life, why dont they offer lower version (Its 100% possible)?",Negative
Intel,"It's because it's supported on the older a  and b series as well, and not locked to pather lake only. If nvidia supported the full mfg on the 4000 series I think it wouldn't have been much push back, shoot maybe even the 3000 series.",Neutral
Intel,"The limitations of this tech are generally understood now. People felt lied to when Nvidia debuted this feature, because they said that it would double your framerate, and you can feel that that's not quite what's happening (input latency likely goes up instead of down). And, to their credit, I think Intel has even described it as ""frame smoothing,"" which is way closer to the truth than Nvidia has gotten.",Negative
Intel,"Two things are important here.  1. Intel giving mfg to older gen cards as well when amd and nvidia didn't.  2. Intel never marketed mfg as ""fps gainer"" thing, only a frame smoother thing. I watched intel engineer interview with digital foundry guy he clearly say this.",Neutral
Intel,"The way they advertise it is super different, way less scummy than Nvidia. Intel is pretty transparent in their marketing whenever it’s used, they always provide performance numbers without frame generation and treat FG as an optional extra, versus Nvidia who’ll always use it if they can and obfuscate its usage when it is.",Neutral
Intel,"most probably people are still mad about ""5070 = 4090""",Negative
Intel,Please find the slide where Intel says that a 5060 = 4090...,Neutral
Intel,Has Intel really “used it for marketing slides against AMD without FrameGen”? I thought those slides were FrameGen vs FrameGen and Native vs Native.,Neutral
Intel,most people have actually used it by now and understand it's applications.,Neutral
Intel,"Because they claimed 5070 was hitting 4090 performance due to MFG, which just invites ridicule.",Negative
Intel,"Is there pushback? I find Nvidia's framegen to be way better than anything else. And it sucks because handhelds are the ones that would benefit the most from it, FSR4 is really meh compared.",Negative
Intel,Its way better then lsfg though. Xell helps with latency a TON. Makes it actually usable imo,Positive
Intel,"LSFG is software. It is not a hardware accelerated technique, like shader models and tesselation. It is not slated to be incorporated at API level in DirectX. Stop pushing this crap. Gd cant you guys get it yet?   This software is absolutely no replacement for hardware FG, yet it is being shoved down your throat again!",Negative
Intel,Those blur the UI which is awful,Neutral
Intel,"You don't have to pay anything, just accept and have fun.",Negative
Intel,Okay. thats fine.,Positive
Intel,Just open it up in an incognito window and accept? That's what I do with most random links.,Neutral
Intel,"It's very much not obvious, but with frame gen both the starting framerate and game can massively affect the result.   Worst case turning on FGx2 can almost double your latency, though around 30-50% is typical. Not an issue if you're running closer to 100 FPS to start with, but if the game has relatively high latency and you're limited to 144 Hz it can feel flat out worse. 3x or 4x, wouldn't bother without a 240 Hz+ monitor.",Negative
Intel,"The difference in latency between 144 and 300 fps is extremely small. It might not make sense in competitive fps games. But in a lot of games, it just makes sense.   And the difference in latency between games and controllers is already much bigger.",Neutral
Intel,Something's wrong with your setup. FG and MFG works great on my 360Hz OLED monitor.,Negative
Intel,"Physics be dammed, marketing will plow through with laggy frames and claim a victory.  Meanwhile, if you actually use it... 🤮[](https://emojipedia.org/face-vomiting)  [](https://emojipedia.org/face-vomiting)",Neutral
Intel,"> If generate from 144 fps, to 300, it’s looks better, but feels much worse.  I'm willing to bet my whole life savings you would never be able to tell in a million years and are just being an elitist hipster.",Negative
Intel,"Using an Intel B580 with XeSS and MFG and there's no noticeable input lag or degrading of the image quality. I've used FSR and have been able to use DLSS on friends PCs, and I know what you're referring to, and I agree that it happens. It just isn't an issue with Intels MFG the same way.",Neutral
Intel,Broadly exaggerated. :D,Neutral
Intel,What would anyone gain from this?,Neutral
Intel,Less competition is always better for everyone. /s,Positive
Intel,"But 2x fg is already good enough for most people. If Intel wants a real win, increase supply of their gpus",Neutral
Intel,Downvoted due to ignoring the content. :P,Neutral
Intel,"I'm using it, and it's very good!",Positive
Intel,"> ""Nvidia is marketing fg/mfg as ""performance"" which upsets people""  Notably Intel's Tom Peterson seemed to echo that opinion when DF interviewed him a month or two ago.",Neutral
Intel,Ya i cant believe my 3080 didnt get the basic fg. I already upgraded to the 3080 for better dlss and then was instantly told I cant hVe fg either.,Negative
Intel,Likely?  Input latency goes up,Neutral
Intel,"Consciously ignoring the ""this is impossible without AI statement"" that was said immediately after",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you'll find a slide where Nvidia said the 5060 beats a 4090,Neutral
Intel,"There was one slide where it was frame gen against native, where Intel advertised that with MFG, the maximum possible output was XXX better",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, I know it isn't the same. My problem was more the title and not the technology",Negative
Intel,"no framegen is usable, i have tried it on 50 series gpus even at 120 fps and you turn on framegen you can tell shit is delayed, keep turning it on though makes it easier to get frags for me",Negative
Intel,"1. I used it as example on why using the FPS multiplier is a stupid way to measure it      2. LSFG has a lower cost on system resources in my experience than FSR Frame gen      3. It works for nearly every game and nearly every GPU, means you can even use it on an RX 480     4. It works well. Yes it isn't perfect because it also uses frame gen on stuff like the HUD and so on, but it still gives a rather smooth experience      5. Nobody is talking about it being a replacement to in game FG",Neutral
Intel,I wouldn't recommend using 20x either. It was just me saying the title is stupid,Negative
Intel,"Incognito doesn't stop data collection, it literally says so when you open a private window in most browsers. It's just so you don't save cookies or that it doesn't show up in your browser history.",Negative
Intel,"The tech is going to create a lot of problems for reviewers soon. They used to somewhat avoid incorporating dlss in reviews, but its gotten to good stage & frankly ue5 games by default makes people upscale. 4x is already ""funny"" to use cant imagine 6x.  Honestly it makes low end cards bit tricky to criticize. ""bad gen-gen uplift, 8gb vram, but if u optimize + upscaling + fg/mfg, you get 200+fps"" The average watcher will be like what? 200+fps??",Negative
Intel,"But 30 series was never promised or got any ""better dlss""?",Negative
Intel,I think it's really neat how my 4090 is missing a function that's available on the $400 5060...,Neutral
Intel,One good thing about frame gen is that it forces the addition of reflex. Frame Gen + reflex can be better than native fps without reflex.  Of course native + reflex is the best option if you value latency above all else.,Positive
Intel,"If you care about Latency, then you should buy an Nvidia card.  Dlss frame gen in a game means reflex WILL be there too. And that allows Nvidia cards to have lower latency despite having lower fps.  Here is what DF showed.  https://youtu.be/MnCHHSwa7R4?si=SDwuGtSbOHOIVO2h&t=4260  5070 - 37 fps - 53.2 ms  9070 - 43 fps - 63.2 ms",Neutral
Intel,"""The RTX 5070: 4090 performance at $549""   Jensen's caveat statement was still deceptive because interpolated frames are not performance. It was the icing on the cake of the least exciting new generation in a long time. In the past we've gotten 70 series cards that competed with previous gen flagships. This gen the 80 series doesn't even come close to beating it. The 5070 is neck and neck with the 4070 Ti so they knew they had to spin some narrative.",Negative
Intel,"Oh my bad, it wasnt the 5060, it was the 5070.... such a big difference...  [https://www.neowin.net/news/nvidia-admits-rtx-5070-nowhere-near-4090-performance-without-dlss-fake-frames/](https://www.neowin.net/news/nvidia-admits-rtx-5070-nowhere-near-4090-performance-without-dlss-fake-frames/)",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, another sneaky thing I never see mentioned is that mfg also lowers base fps by like 10%+",Negative
Intel,If that's true then no AMD card is usable.  The input latency of framegen is paired with Nvidia Reflex comes out about equal to how it was before you turned on Reflex. Which is also where the AMD cards end up because their anti-lag 1 isn't very good and anti-lag 2 only supports three games.,Negative
Intel,"5. What? Everyone is misled. The entire ""need to cap fps"" is because of this stupid program! It's preventing proper information from reaching people. People are using this over dlss fg and you see posts everywhere.   I do own it. It's not bad for what it is, but its gonna suck on a 480. Need to move forward. Smooth motion blows this out of the water too.",Negative
Intel,20x sounds like a neat idea for a challenge playthrough of your favourite game.,Neutral
Intel,"I guess it depends on how paranoid you want to be about it.

Intel,It made people better now that they know to care about frame pacing and latency too,Positive
Intel,Well deserved. Burn them all down. Let people find out things on their own.,Negative
Intel,I have a 4k/120 and I don’t need more than 110-120 fps. I refuse to use frame gen,Neutral
Intel,I mean sure. Doesnt change the fact its scummy behavior. Nvidia makes sure every single new Gen now isnt compatible with the previous one.  At a certain point sure. But when the 4080 released my 3080 should be able to do all the same things just slowly... its wild that even my old 1070ti could do everything AMD cards can lol and my 3080 can too but yet not Nvidia.,Negative
Intel,"If latency was so important, then it would be front and center of benchmarks instead of 0.1% lows",Neutral
Intel,"Then directly be angry at what you are really angry about. No one wanted the trash N3B node except Intel and Apple (who both flopped with it relatively speaking), N3E was not ready in time, so Nvidia made do with a refined architecture on same node and created MFG to try to push the subjective experience in a way the hardware could not.  But really,  despite widespread criticism based on latency, how many actually put active testing on latency and FPS with 5070 MFG vs 4090 except DF at launch? BTW, pretty interesting, DF says it's in between 4080S and 4090, but more like 4080S when all factors are taken into account.   Also, how many use latency even today, when making say, a 9070 vs 5070 comparison video? Or even benchmarking games. You said it's important right? That's why 5070=4090 is so bad right?",Negative
Intel,It was a joke based off your typo,Negative
Intel,"Yeah, that is also something I weirdly never see being talked about. In my experience, LSFG is also lighter than AMDs Frame gen, to a point where I would rather play something like Spider-Man 2 with lsfg, than with in game Frame gen",Neutral
Intel,"Wasn't smooth motion only for RDNA3+? Plus for people that use Linux (including the steam deck, although I wouldn't use it on the LCD) wouldn't have access to it either way      I will be honest, I also used it over FSR Frame gen in Spiderman 2, because with FSR FG I felt a noticeable dip in FPS and smoothness, while it still looked perfectly fine with lsfg-vk and it ran smoothly. At that moment it was a better option for me, not in general but for me   It is also not preventing proper information from reaching people, that is what the news reporter and marketing departments do by themselves. It is their fault that people think of frame gen as something amazing that fixes everything. Not LSFG. LSFG is just a tool that helps people to maybe keep their device longer",Neutral
Intel,If you like pain yes    I think LSFG also caps on your screens refresh rate and then just lowers your FPS. Means a whole 12 FPS,Neutral
Intel,Even Firefox doesn't stop data collection from Firefox itself.,Negative
Intel,Reviewers don't factor in Nvidia's Reflex vs non reflex when comparing cards (at native or upscaled) though. It seems like latency only matters while complaining about Frame Generation.,Neutral
Intel,"That is the beauty, dont use it. Everyone happy",Negative
Intel,"There's nothing scummy about it. You just don't realize that ""my card can technically do it, but more slowly"" negates the whole point of tech that improves performance.  If you lose more FPS by turning on FG than you get from it, what's the point?  Also, DLSS 4.5 literally came to all RTX cards, so you're just flat wrong.",Negative
Intel,"I'm not defending their scummy behavior, I'm pointing out that if you wanted something other than performance (and good performance/$, albeit with a crippled vram) from 30 gen, you made it up in your head. That is all.",Negative
Intel,"It is getting there. For decades benchmarks used average fps. Then we started seeing 1% lows and after that again, 0.1% lows. Now frametime graphs are used. We will probably have to start benching image quality for upscaling as well.",Negative
Intel,"Smooth motion is nvidias ""lsfg"" that employs tensor cores.",Neutral
Intel,It doesn't,Neutral
Intel,the little df clip video covering reflex recently is crazy. i did not realize how much it helps despite always using it. ofc it's game by game but it can be drastic reduction in latency while adding fg is really not adding that much. and fg + reflex can still be lower than no reflex no fg lol.   idk why latency is not covered responsiveness is like one of the most important factors to games imo. antilag 2 is in like maybe 10 games this should be pushed more it's literally only nvidia competing when it comes to it. especially since you can inject reflex pretty easily through other means.,Positive
Intel,Well then there is also only a limited amount of people that have access to that. So LSFG can be used in the other use cases,Neutral
Intel,"Despite being from 2009, Unigine Heaven is such a timeless benchmark.",Neutral
Intel,"> At first I was told between the balanced mode on Microsoft Windows and balanced mode on Linux there can be up to a 15 Watt difference in the PL1 state. Then I was told the power limits were the same under Windows and Linux for this laptop, but that MSI programmed their balanced defaults lower than Intel recommends. Intel expects their OEMs to have higher PL1 minimum values for balanced mode but MSI set it lower at 15 Watts min and 30 Watts max for at least this laptop model.   Wait what, why did MSI set the power so low on the Prestige 14....   I really wanted the Prestige 16 Flip, hope that one has a higher power limit",Neutral

Intel,"Seems like Xe drivers are still horrible, but Panther Lake brute forces its way to a win.",Negative
Intel,Has there been any articles commenting on battery life on Linux with Panther Lake? I know this article and the previous one was focused on perforamnce in the CPU and now iGPU but any word if battery life can be as ood as windows?,Neutral
Intel,"It is so odd to see the infatuation of the writer with Strix Halo wanting to compare it. It isn't comparable, it is a much larger chip, it is like comparing a Snapdragon Elite to a M4 Max. The writer keeps lamenting paragraph after paragraph about it.  They should compare comparable things. This fiat 500 isn't as fast as this Tesla type of thing is weird.",Negative
Intel,"I understand there's a lot of fanfare around Arc and Panther Lake in this sub. Many are firm believers that Intel will finally break the duopoly of AMD and Nvidia and while that may be the case, everyone seems to gloss over the driver side of things, not to mention the massive CPU overhead.   Just yesterday, I was recommended the latest video from YouTuber ""zWORMz"" benchmarking the 'ancient' RDR2 on a B580.  And even on Windows, the guy was frustrated with various driver issues and how the GPU wouldn't even run in his mid-range machine with an i5-12600K. Some issues even popped up right when he was recording.  With that in mind, I can only imagine the experience on Linux!",Neutral
Intel,Should be compared to Strix Halo based on price.   The power consumption does not look all that great:  > The Core Ultra X7 358H came out on a geo mean basis to 1.23x the performance of the Radeon 890M graphics with Strix Halo but at 1.25x the power consumption on average. The peak power consumption was also around 1.25x that of the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. So rather even on a performance-per-Watt basis overall.  Intel has a lot of work to do. 2 nodes advantage and still just matching Strix Point in power efficiency.,Neutral
Intel,Semi serious answer probably they're trying to not making raptor lake repeat. On more related to the laptop msi probably trying to win some battery life benchmark or trying to not breaking their laptop chassis and components quickly because of heat.,Neutral
Intel,It’s also not the highest performance profile.,Neutral
Intel,The fix that Will improve Nvidia performance in Linux should improve Intel performance as well,Positive
Intel,"Redhat/Fedora worked a ton on the AMD Drivers as well, a lot of stuff in the RADV Driver says  >> based in part on anv driver which is Copyright © 2015 Intel Corporation  I think some of the people working at Valve use to work for redhat.",Neutral
Intel,"at least the drivers were 100% stable  >Once sorting through the low power limits on the MSI Prestige 14 laptop, the Arc B390 graphics with the Core Ultra X7 358H were rather impressive on Linux.

Intel,"I think they're trying to get ahead of all the comments complaining that Strix Halo wasn't included/accusations of bias in favor of Intel by not including AMD's top of the line (even though, as you say, it's in a very different weight class).",Neutral
Intel,"There's nothing wrong comparing it to Strix Halo. Regardless of the data measured from Strix Halo the conclusion will inevitably be made on price/perf, perf/area etc. It's simply another interesting data point that is shared and pull comparisons from, which I am all for.

Intel,"Yeah, the Intel Vulkan drivers on Linux especially is still pretty bad, among the benchmarks linked in the post is FurMark which has both an OpenGL and Vulkan version, and Intel takes a noticeable hit in performance when using Vulkan while AMD sees basically no difference between OpenGL and Vulkan. The Vulkan driver being the weak part is a big problem since Vulkan is what's used for running games from DirectX 8 up to 12 by default, and for DX12 Vulkan is the only choice.  In my case I have a Framework 13 with the Intel Core Ultra 5 125H (Meteor Lake) and the Arc (Alchemist) 7-core iGPU, and I can't get a stable 60fps on Forza Horizon 5 no matter what I do, even disabling every graphical effect possible and dropping the resolution to 1024x768 doesn't work (if anything it's worse since the minimums stay the same so the difference between average and minimum just gets larger and the stutters feel way worse), while the LCD Steam Deck can manage 60fps flat perfectly fine at 1280x800 minimum settings at least, and it sips less power then too (under 15W vs 25W for the Framework), even though the CPU is just Zen2 which shouldn't be faster than the Meteor Lake P-cores, and since it's the LCD version the RAM is just LPDDR5-5500 so memory bandwidth shouldn't be too different from the DDR5-5600 in the Framework 13.",Negative

As for ""can it play all my titles reasonably well"", I don't remember any specific titles that didn't run at all, so I guess the answer is yes? I do remember having tested Oblivion Remastered and Dragon Age Veilguard, both are Steam Deck Verified, and they do indeed run, but it's very much a 30fps experience reliant on FSR to achieve even that, so I'd guess it probably won't handle newer or heavier titles any better. If you have any specific titles you care about I'd suggest checking ProtonDB and filter the reports to just Steam Deck ones to get a picture of how the game might run, and sometimes games are marked unsupported by Valve but does actually run with caveats like input quirks so you'd be able to play if you're fine with those quirks.",Negative

Intel,">The fact that Intel will use nVidia technology in the iGPU sector in the long term  You're takin the nv intel deal outta context. Intel is still gonna use their own igpu ip for the average mobile socs and their dgpus. It's the premium dgx or halo type prosumer skus that are going with nv ip. There might be some gaming capable devices but just like strix halo they ain't primarily aimed at gamers. The price just ain't worth it compared to a standard mobile cpu + nvidia dgpu combo  Idk why this post is even a thing. All manufacturers are delaying dgpu products for gamers because they have shit margins compared to dc gpus. Nvidia's dc margins in the 70+%, why would they care about gamers? Gaming gpus have worse margins than diy cpus which have worse margins than dc gpus. It's the same for amd  Do ya know **how much money gamers are making for nvidia each quarter? $4.5-5b. How much do ai gpus make for nvidia? Over $50b.** How much for amd? Estimated at $4b+ for 2026. **Amd's making the equivalent of capturing 100% of the gaming gpu market from ai gpus and with even higher margins.** Why would they want to sell to gamers?

I'm sure most of the last generation IGPUs like the Radeon 880M or 890M are also powerful enough (considering they are faster than the Arc A380).  We've always known that the Forza Horizon games are very well optimized and are able to run on IGPUs just fine. Keep in mind that Forza Horizon 5 runs just fine on the Vega 3 IGPU in the 7 year old AMD Athlon 3000G.  The article is presenting the trivial fact that the B390 is listed as the minimum spec for the upcoming Forza Horizon 6 as somehow being a huge win for Intel. That's not very good journalism.

Also buyers should be careful because not every laptop presented has the power and thermals set to permit full power sustained boosting at the wattages tested in the reviews.

There already exists a large library of games that would not be playable and Microsoft suddenly (drastically) lowering the minimum target would be messy for devs. Even the Series S can barely do raytracing effects, for example. [Microsoft maintains a compatibility list](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/handheld-compatibility) much like Valve with the Steam Deck.

Four generations of NVidia, three generations of AMD in, it's still incredibly difficult to find a game where the ray tracing is visible without a side-by-side screenshot comparison AND where it doesn't make the game look worse. And forcing that setting to ""on"" with certain presets doesn't exactly fix that in any way.

Intel,"die area is not the only cost indicator. B580 actually uses N5 fab, which is likely cheaper than N4, used by 5050. In reality, B580 only has about ~15% more transistors and if we assume N5 is cheaper per transistor and N5 has higher yields (by being more mature) i'd say their die cost might be very similar.  While yes, it has wider memory, the chips are clocked lower, so they can buy slower bins, reducing per chip cost.   B580 has more power draw, which in turn costs more for power delivery and cooling.  All in all, AIB manufacturer likely has lower margin per card as it stands, so i wouldn't be surprised if intel is taking a lower margin on the gpu/gddr combo to get more market share.  Nvidia on the other hand optimized their cost REALLY well, as they have been doing GPUs for almost 30 years.",Neutral
Intel,"Nvidia is getting such good performance out of such a small die because they're the best. Simple as. They've been doing GPU's for decades. It's not unexpected that at this stage Intel needs to use a larger die to match the performance - it would be incredibly surprising if that wasn't the case.  But a small *part* of that die size advantage comes from that narrow 128bit bus, and *part* of B580's appeal is its wider bus and subsequently more VRAM.",Positive

They stoke hardware enthusiast anger for their own gain. Personally i think the harm they do to the space/peoples mentality is farm more than the amount of good most (key word most, fire risks and stuff deserve prompt drama) of their coverage does.   Even this title takes a topic and very educational opportunity to provide actual hardware coverage and immediatly try’s to stoke negative furry about some aspect of the hardware industry. Its just non stop with them. I dont think its healthy for anyone to watch then honestly, which is sad as i used to enjoy their review/news. I hope for their sake they are not actually so perpetually angry and they are doing what they do to knowingly manipulate their audience for increased views/engagement. I cant imagine living life so constantly angry at every possible point over computer hardware, as much as i am saddened by the current state hardware and love gaming.   As tough as it is with rising prices and such and sad to think of what we could have instead, modern hardware, gaming, and such is in a nearly historic good state (realistic cost to perf is probably lowest in history other than brief periods such as the 30 series launch), and is a very cost effective hobby compared with other ones for the time you get out of it. Many great games launch all the time (even if big name traditional games have largely went to trash). They are easier to run with hardware (like the ARC gpu) being quite cheap and capable.

Intel,"> Wasn't that the B310? That was supposed to be the $100 bracket.  It's the A310, which is Alchemist and it's pretty much dogwater for anything beyond being a 'display out' card. The claim that NVIDIA has abandoned that segment is stupid... They've had offerings in this segment for years, plus anyone smart will just go buy a used GPU, your money goes way further. For example, the GTX 1650 performs basically 10-15% better, has better drivers, better encoding and generally is better supported. It's older, but I mean Alchemist wasn't exactly impressive either when it released and pretty much Intel has moved onto Battlemage and Celestial driver optimisations instead.   Plus let's be real here I went and searched and I found only weird places tend sell the brand new A310, the only local computer shop I found selling it in Australia for instance is a big one which is good surprisingly, but they had it for $189 AUD, a total rip tbh. A used 1650 is like $100 AUD and a used 1650 SUPER is like $120 AUD. No reason to buy an A310 tbh, pocket the cash and move on. Or if you're really intent on spending around that much buying a used RTX 2060 for like $20 AUD more, so a total of $200-210 AUD is better. Then on the AMD side you have the RX 6400 which had an MSRP of $159 USD and it's again a solid 10-15% faster, but much better off buying a used 6500 XT or 6600. Neither company has abandoned the segment, they had offerings for years and the used market basically obliterated any point to buying a brand new card like this.  >  To be fair that's an almost useless tier nowadays because iGPUs are capable of outperforming the cards in those brackets.  Yep this too. Honestly, I mean it's cool they're showing how they make cards on this factory tour, but to be like ""NVIDIA and AMD abandoned this segment"" is stupid when it comes to the A310.

GT710 hasn't made sense for like 8 years at least, even when it was relevant people laughed at it, but it did the job for 'display out' and such which was all that mattered. GTX 1630 was okay but it was supposed to be $149 USD MSRP and it came out for like $200 USD in most stores due to GPU shortage at the time, not much NVIDIA could really do about that.",Neutral

Relying on the Strix Halo is not an option here.  It's pretty much impossible to find a good laptops that use it.

Intel,"They announced a first party Strix Halo PC at CES, but it'll probably be really expensive.",Neutral
Intel,"> And yet AMD managed it for the PS5... it's clearly possible.  Well for two reasons:  1. Sony bankrolls the R&D of the APU and it's underlying architectures which allows AMD to make it for basically cost and have a low BOM on it. They didn't pay as much as they normally would for the R&D, tapeout, testing etc.  2. It's a console APU, it literally has to be cost effective to make sense, otherwise it becomes like Strix Halo and SONY goes out of business. Also most consoles are sold on launch for a small loss with SONY and Microsoft recouping those lost funds off game sales, online subscriptions and store revenue. Then over time they tend to shrink console APUs on newer nodes which makes it more power efficient and less expensive to produce as a smaller chip on a newer node typically has better yields, it also allows SONY or Microsoft to put in lower quality components like less heatpipes in a new revision or Slim console, for similar thermal headroom and save on BOM cost.   I mean there's a reason why they do not offer the PS5 APU as an off the shelf product, only the cutdown bad yields go onto being some cryptocurrency mining board or some Linux APU and with the performance being cut its usually worse value than buying off the shelf dGPU parts like a 5060 or something.  I don't know why you're seriously arguing that APUs for Desktop and Laptop PCs are a viable product. For one, they've never been viable, not once. Even Strix Halo which is honestly the best APU I've ever seen has been ruined by its high cost. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of an APU, an all in one chip that does it all. But unless you're like Intel and you're willing to do a tile based design and or basically have a true chiplet where you can link lots of smaller dGPU tiles together it doesn't really work. You're just better off buying dedicated CPU and GPU parts for better price to performance. If you don't believe me, I can buy an [RTX 5070 Laptop right now for $1900 AUD](https://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-katana-15-hx-14xwgk-156-qhd-i7-16gb-ram-512gb-rtx-5070-gaming-laptop-black) and that will easily outperform Strix Halo which has less performance and typically costs over $4000 AUD... [Even a lowly 4060 laptop fairs better.](https://youtu.be/RycbWuyQHLY)  The only thing APUs excel in is this, if you want something relatively cheap but capable. i.e it can run a game at 30 FPS with medium settings at a low resolution. i.e something like Panther Lake or Apple's M series chips.

""Mainstream"" pricing is subjective in this class, unlike GPUs where there are 5060s and 5080s segments. At CES, there are surprisingly dGPUs still being paired with Panther Lake, heck, Strix Halo was designed purely for it's iGPU, even the engineers stand by this (PCIe slots are being released in miniPCs because that's what the market wants).  Also, this ""big APU"" argument is based on chiplets/tiles. Strix Halo isn't monolithic, same as Panther Lake. They both have the same design strategy that makes it economically viable to tape out in the first place.  I am not trying to say that STX-H is better than PTL, PTL was like the only thing I was looking forward to at CES, but this whole thread surrounding around how STX-H is a failure doesn't make sense at all.",Neutral

Arrow lake (Desktop) at least closed on efficiency, but lacks a bit of gaming performance still, hopefully Nova Lake will be the step required to push more competition.   On GPU the same, AMD does not compete with NVIDIA in higher segments while NVIDIA is fairly comfortable with their setup and increases prices because they want to milk customers to increase their ridiculious margins (up to 70%) that they are used to from AI-Chips.   And now Intel also provides Multi-Frame generation, while a niche for me still, starting to compete with AMD and closes up to NVIDIA in terms of Software support, which they lacked the most and fixes a lot of problems.

Intel,"I got downvoted everytime I brought this up, but this is precisely why Nvidia wanted a deal to have an Nvidia iGPU tile on an Intel APU: Large iGPUs in thin and lights are going to get good enough over the next few years to make them the new entry-level graphics option for people. This directly threatens Nvidia's consumer laptop volume in the entry segment. Intel is claiming close to 4050 performance at this lower TDP, and that's certainly good enough for many to not have the tradeoffs of having a dGPU in their laptop.  If the new market is moving towards putting GPUs on the CPU package instead of discretely on the board, Nvidia doesn't want to place all of their hopes on WoA becoming better, and are hedging by doing both their own SoC *and* an x86 APU with Intel.  The XPS line dropping Nvidia discrete all together is proof of this. In these sub 70W total laptop power markets, a discrete GPU is just eats into the power budget too much.",Neutral
Intel,"In the ultraportables market (like XPS), integrated graphics just make so much sense (energy envelope; cooling system required; battery life; etc); and that's already substantial and before considering the cost of a NVIDIA mobile dGPU itself.

Intel,"The graphs all listed games and I didn't see any synthetic benchmark scores were listed, so yeah.",Neutral
Intel,The relative proportion of the die isn't as important as the die size itself and the node ofc.   Lunar lake for example has an estimated die size smaller than the hx370 so even if they did make the die bigger I don't think that is going to massively raise the price. Not to mention intel owns the foundry unlike AMD who are outsourcing to TSMC. This isn't in the realm of a strix halo competitor with a 300 mm\^2 + die size.   Dell for example has already refreshed the XPS line with intel panther lake and cut out the option for a dedicated gpu.,Neutral

Intel,Who said anything about basing the entire product stack around handhelds?,Neutral
Intel,"That's not quite right. Power levels are determined by the frequency of a given CPU core. The LPE cores in Lunar and Panther lake both clock up to 3.7 GHz, so given the added IPC of the new Panther lake e-cores and better process node, it is more efficient.

Intel,Xe3p was alr confirmed coming im sure Celestial happens,Neutral
Intel,"We will see, while Intel's PR and marketing is extremely confusing, Intel did confirm Xe3P will come to desktop; and at least from driver updates (as a very happy B580 owner) driver support has been constant and lively.

Intel,It's 10% faster geomean across 45 games,Neutral
Intel,That can be resolved if either Intel or AMD decides to unlock quad-channel on consumer chips and mobos. It's artificial market segmentation; the die area needed to deliver more (LP)DDR5 channels is absolutely minuscule; for a huge boost in iGPU performance.,Neutral
Intel,Cache. Lots of it.,Neutral
Intel,"They are using 9600mt/s lpddr5x, could also have a lot of cache, (iirc 890m configs were nerfed in cache because they wanted to put a npu instead), and also could be a synthetic benchmark or specific game that isn't very bandwidth heavy.",Neutral
Intel,Panther Lake still has a 128 bit memory bus so only models with 9600 mt/s will get slightly faster shared memory bandwidth than Lunar Lake.   I wonder how this will manifest in games as the only performance leaks have been from Geekbench and 3DMark which may not be as bandwidth intensive as real games and applications.,Neutral
Intel,"This seems to be correct, since checking NotebookCheck for the 30 watt 4050 shows that it’s around 70% faster than the HX370 in games, which is roughly where Intel places their iGPU.  The performance difference between a 30 watt 4050 and full 140 watt 4050 is around 41 percent performance based on Time Spy",Neutral
Intel,"basically cheating tho, rtx cards in dell laptops are barely getting enough watts to even turbo",Negative
Intel,"That's the only way to do a fair comparison, really.   Because the 45 watts that Intel chip uses is shared for the entire chip.   So it's still 45w Intel + igpu vs 60w Intel+gpu",Neutral
Intel,"It’s a super strong generational gain though, it’s like the jump from Vega 8CU to rdna2 12CU. The kind of single gen gain you see once in 5 years at most",Positive
Intel,The thing about that... what sort of tile are we expecting them to package up? As you say if we can get 4050ish performance from an Intel iGPU then they really can't be far off 5050M... and maybe even 5060M performance in future.  Do you think they'll offer something like a 5070 tile? that almost seems excessive (and difficult to actually package from a thermal point of view in a laptop) but it seems like the 5050/5060 sort of tier is going to be pretty well covered as a traditional iGPU soon.,Neutral
Intel,AMD actually introduced lower tier Strix Halos in this CES; and the first budget laptop thats gonna use it is [the Asus TUF A14](https://youtu.be/h27w0PXFBgk?si=Pa7UQhinywF-uFMj&t=306),Neutral

Intel,"Different poster than OP.  Compute tile on Lunar Lake is 140mm2 on N3E with a small 46mm2 controller N6 tile. Strix Point (HX 370) as a whole is 233 mm2 on N4P. Lunar Lake is clearly cheaper, but given the newer node and packaging not massively so, likely by around 20-25%.  Panther Lake, with the B390, is going to be significantly more expensive than Lunar Lake. The B390 GPU has 50% more CUs, and that is very likely still on N3 or some variant (Intel only labeled this as external on their deck). CPU size 4xP+12xE as opposed to Lunar's 4+4, which should still be significantly more area with the core upgrades despite being on A18.  The ""mainstream"" variant also has the 4xP + 12 x E CPU, so even with the GPU being cut to 4 units it's likely somewhat more expensive than Lunar Lake.  Intel Foundry in general isn't any cheaper than TSMC. With Intel being practically the only user and development expenses it's likely more expensive than TSMC despite TMSC's margins. For all purposes it's an accounting trick to hide CCG's and DCAI's 5-15% operating margins if you divide the foundry losses per group revenue.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, although the actual low power 8 core successor to Lunar Lake is the 335/365 with half GPU cores and slower RAM.",Neutral
Intel,"even if you exclude the CPU CCDs the graphics die alone is bigger than a RTX 5070Ti mobile GPU, which also retails for \~$2000-$3000, same as Strix Halo laptop",Neutral
Intel,"This is slightly splitting hairs but the 8c CCDs in Strix Halo is actually NOT the same chiplet as the ones in desktop zen 5 parts. It iirc is produced on a smaller node, slimmed down, and has different ( or no) TSVs.  It is similar to design and cache sizes to desktop however, but the changes to the CCDs were done to improve low power performance characteristics. They are likely a bit more expensive than Desktop CCDs.  I believe it is discussed in a chips&cheese deep dive.",Neutral
Intel,"AMD have largely been ""winning by doing nothing"" due to their better driver support stack for gaming on iGPUs, rather than actually throwing superior hardware at it.  It's almost ironic how AMD's mobile chipsets are now the ""Intel 14nm+++++"" of this generation.  Constant minor refreshes or even straight-up re-badges of old chips.  Now that Intel Arc has been around a while now and is getting quite capable.  I suspect Intel have a real opportunity to overtake AMD this generation in the iGPU space (ie. handheld and mini-PCs), especially since the new AMD APUs are just **another** refresh with a clock boost and Strix Halo is not scaled or priced to be actually affordable by normal people in that market.  XeSS can also act as a massive force-multiplier in power-constrained scenarios like handhelds.  AMD really shot themselves in the foot by either not building or not allowing FSR4 to function on RDNA3/3.5, which all current and now next gen AMD handhelds are stuck on.  Given how effective DLSS is on the Switch2, one could only imagine how kickass a Nvidia chip in a handheld PC could be with the far more ubiquitous DLSS support.",Neutral
Intel,Now they are not. The panther lake igpus are undisputed winners (excluding the 395+ from amd since it's just not gonna be mainstream). You can get a 358H or 368H and you'll have solid laptop for igpu gaming far cheaper than the 395+,Positive

Intel,"Well you said it, it's TSMC capacity, meaning also a priority issue. They prioritize AI over consumers and then increase the price by reducing availability, meaning the same chip costs more, meaning more margin.  Seeing they increase the 5090 to roughly 5k (USD) is just the beginning and as I know all companies will use the increasing memory prices to say they must increase the product price, just not proportional to the memory costs.  next step: then they will use this to move more to streaming instead of owning",Neutral

A lot of new patents have surfaced since that expand upon the design in many ways, but I'm waiting for the last RDNA5 to be made public before making a potential follow up post.  But regardless even if they fix HW situation completely they'll prob fail spectacularly with SW stack as they've done so far with FSR Redstone and FSR4 game adoption. Even hear a lot of people complaining about having to use Optiscaler, even in newer games.   Also NVIDIA will no doubt move the needle a lot nextgen yet again. They already did with DLSS 4.5 and DFG and something tells me that DLSS5 is gonna be even worse for AMD. They better prepare for what's to come.  Worst case it's a complete massacre. I can see the following scenario happening:  **HW:** NVIDIA invests all their silicon budget into fixing 5090 scaling bottlenecks (16 GPCs instead of 12, revamped scheduling etc...), fixes other problems with 50 series (redesign cachemem mostly) + goes Brr on ML and to some extent RT. Raster goes up 35-40%, everything else goes up multiple times.   Worst case ML HW gets bumped to 4-8X NVFP4 rate, although 2-4X sounds more likely.  **SW:** NVIDIA uses this new insane ML HW to make new DLSS models. DLSS5 goes all in on NVFP4 and is faster than DLSS4.5. DLSS5 SR and RR for 50 series + 60 series which is lightweight and fast on new GPUs (high FPS), and a new DLSS ULTRA SR for 60 series (released across stack but painfully slow for anything pre 60 series) striving for maximum Image quality. The smaller model will be better than DLSS4.5 and the big model another tier entirely (DLSS3 -> 4 leap easily on top of DLSS4.5).   They also make DRS compatible with DLSS SR and RR so users get greater flexibility here similar to DFG for framegen.   FG will also release in two versions one light and heavy. Will also work with Reflex 2. It's possible only the big model will be frame extrapolation + limited to 60 series. Should make FG result in lower ms instead of higher + overall image quality far superior and basically all issues solved up to at least 4X.   Oh and a flood of MLPs and a demo showcasing the absurd visuals the 6090 can push. Moves goalpost past ReSTIR PT and will look borderline offline render quality. Very close to Blender renderers. IDK how they'll do it but MLPs are borderline magic, so prob doable.  Thinking about it more you're prob right and even if RDNA5 HW is amazing even beats 6090 in PT, a DLSS5 feature suite this impressive + moving goalpost to MLP based neural rendering will make RDNA5 irrelevant. As always SW and marketing will kill any momentum from HW side. Really hope I'm wrong but don't think so.  Sorry for the rambling.",Neutral

Intel,"Yeah prob not realistic. I just tried to outline a nightmare scenario for AMD. As for the RDNA5 stuff we'll see how good it ends up being.  Agreed serious issues fs. RTX 5090 scheduling is brain dead. 16 SM GPCs, one central scheduler for 170 CUs. The smaller the internal res the harder it is to keep things going. Someone smarter than me could prob make a core scaling efficiency chart for different resolutions clearly showcasing how RT > raster and derive different formulas for 1080p, 1440p, 4K etc... . There's simply no reason why it has to be this bad moving forward.       But it's also interesting to entertain that RDNA5 could be a nightmare for NVIDIA. If NVIDIA doesn’t fix scheduling AMD's nextgen could be a real nightmare scenario for them. The modular and decentralized scheduling will be a gamechanger and based on what patents have said scaling is almost perfect and can scale to [arbitrarily large configurations](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12153957B2), yes they used that wording. AT0 will function like 8 x AT4 instead of running into massive scaling issues. In fact based on what the patent has said it might be even better. Consider each scaling domain with a local cache independent of the L2, where the global command processor only acts as a distributor of work, not an orchestrator. Gains will be observed across the stack but expecting IPC gains to scale with number of CUs. Is this a big deal for RT and 4K native? Yeah but even more so for lower res gaming.    And assuming they reduce CPU overhead even further in new uarch AMD will easily take the max FPS crown although I suspect NVIDIA can finally address their driver overhead issue after booting Maxwell-Pascal. We’ll see who comes out on top in CPU overhead nextgen.  I thought most of that gain vs 4090 was due to extra BW? But yeah high end perf scaling falls apart at sub 4K internal res.",Negative
Intel,"I dont think much can be done with overhead. AMDs overhead is already small, basically letting the API go directly to GPU as it is. While for Nvidia side, isnt most of the overhead related to how Nvidia handles DX12? in that case i dont see it going away for a long time.",Negative
Intel,"Interesting, GN usually gets Tom to do discussions like these but instead decided to publish whatever that previous video was on 'Intel pulling an Nvidia'.

Intel,"There's plenty of old stuff he needs to review. I've said it before but I will say it again and beat it like a drum: He STILL has not reviewed the 9060 XT 8GB for instance. Plenty of content he could have farmed off that, especially BEFORE the RAM shortage where having an 8GB card was some sort of sin in his eyes (except for some reason he ignored it but raile roaded the cheaper RTX 5050, lol did someone say bias?). Instead, he just tore the 9060 XT 8GB down and never touched it again after that teardown. I'm sorry but there's GENUINELY stuff he could be doing instead of farming clicks about 'NVIDIA bad' and 'Intel pathetic', but that won't get him views from drama farming NVIDIA which is what he craves these days. So sad to see a big channel like his who got big off doing solid technical content become a drama-hype ""news"" channel.",Negative

Intel,Trying to apply logic or rules to the internet is a waste of time.,Negative
Intel,"Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds. That however will mean a bigger die and viability might be questionable (considering they're already massive for the performance).",Neutral
Intel,"Price doesn't scale linearly because die sizes make defects scale quadratically. so pricing is the same, 2 50mm\^2 dies are cheaper than 1 100mm\^2 die     However in GPUs there is a fixed cost for every GPU so there is a sweet spot",Neutral

Unless Battlemage is seriously memory bandwidth-limited, it should be almost 50% more performant.  The only question is die size.

Intel,"> Scaling by TDP is not a good metric as they can pack more cores ect. and run them at lower, more efficient speeds.

They can't really afford not to use every bit of die space they have for all that its worth.",Negative
Intel,"Battlemage doesn't have the ability to add more Xe cores per render slice, this is something Intel has changed for Xe3. The BMG-G31 will have 128 ROPs, the same as an RX 9070 XT, or more than an RTX 5080.",Neutral
Intel,"afaik it works on every iGPU since skylake, but the driver is not in the mainline kernel",Neutral

Intel,5060 is not nearly as performant as the 4070,Neutral
Intel,"Your computer is old enough that it would make more sense to do a whole new build, but it depends on your budget. I'd say you'd need around $1500+ for a significant, worthwhile upgrade, considering the current inflated market, especially if you're editing in 4k.   You could certainly try upgrading only the GPU, but it will likely be bottlenecked by the weak CPU, especially for GPU heavy tasks, such as gaming or rendering and you may need to upgrade your power supply if it's not powerful enough.",Neutral
Intel,Any good gpu upgrades and you are cpu bottlenecked.  Get a i7 10700 for cpu if you want to keep your current board.  Then any GPU that's still within budget. I would stay away from AMD cards older than 9000 series mostly because FSR and driver support.  Anything between 2060 Super to 3070 would be a decent upgrade in terms of performance.  I wouldn't go higher than this with the CPU you have.,Neutral
Intel,"600w power supply. idk what ill do, thanks",Neutral
Intel,"I agree that it looks like a software problem. Just to be safe I would still try running benchmarks for the cpu and gpu seperately and compare them to other peoples scores to confirm where the problem is. I don't have experience with trouble shooting an intel gpu but if you have a freesync monitor my best guess would be that its a freesync problem. Take a look around in your monitors settings menu as well, there might be something in there causing it. The only other fix i can think of is formatting the drive and reinstalling windows to completely rule out any software or settings.",Neutral
Intel,"You have checked everything on the PC side of things, but have you checked the settings on your monitor? Some monitors will have different modes and will sometimes limit FPS in some of them.",Neutral

Intel,Check your PCIE lane speed in BIOS,Neutral
Intel,"yeah I know a couple of news outlets did a peice on this, pretty much ur CPU is limiting ur GPU via CPU overhead. not a short topic but essentially ur CPU is a ok match with the a770 but Intel GPUs really want a CPU that can push it",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, like 3D benchmark or correct OCCT? And I'll tell you more, I've disabled every freesync setting directly from the Intel arc control app for every application. And anyway, as a monitor, I have an excellent 180Hz Asus ROG.",Positive
Intel,"I have an ASUS ROG monitor, connected with its original cable, previously set without VRR obviously and set to 180Hz, and I directly deactivated any type of freesync from Intel arc control.",Neutral

Intel,"Strange, I instead encountered, at least on The Finals, a GPU bottleneck, where I saw the CPU at around 60/70% and the GPU constantly at 100%. And keep in mind that The Finals is a CPU-intensive game.",Negative
Intel,"Furthermore, I can't upgrade to AM5 for obvious reasons, so the best I could get on AM4 would be a Ryzen 7 5800x, but I wouldn't be able to get an absurd performance increase.",Neutral

Intel,"yeah its a weird thing that they havent fully resolved, its like an artifical CPU limit in a sense. just the way the drivers interact with the CPU I guess",Negative
Intel,"Exactly, I really don't understand.",Negative
Intel,If your GPU is at 99%+ it is not a CPU bottleneck. It is not worth upgrading your cpu for an A770.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, I know very well, the bottleneck is clearly the GPU and in any case on AM4 there wouldn't be an upgrade that would give me particularly better performance.",Negative
Intel,"Anything somewhat modern. I upgraded to 6750xt from 970, and that was about a 3x improvement. 3060ti is comparable, but has 8gb of VRAM so maybe some ue5 games could be grumpy about that, but for 1080p high it will hold up.",Neutral
Intel,"With that, perhaps a used 2070 or 5700XT, or similar. Any more and I'd want a new platform to go with it.",Neutral
Intel,"Talking strictly about Escape from tarkov, its very cpu intensive and just a gpu upgrade will not give you 60fps. I have a 9600x paired with 7900gre and i was dipping below 100fps in 1080p medium setting",Neutral
Intel,I would look at the RTX 2060S or 2070S. The cpu bottleneck shouldn't be that bad with either of those. I had a 4790k paired with a 2070S for years and it ran great at 1440p.,Positive

Intel,"Just hopping odd what he said, but yea Tarkov is.... a bit of a mess in comparison to throw other games youve listed. For example I bought a fairly cheap prebult from microcenter. Was the rx 7600 build. Arc raiders is flying at 120fps+ while im begging the targods for steady 60 fps over there haha. So when you do upgrade the gpu, just dont be alarmed if tarkov still runs like shit",Negative
Intel,You can change out the hard drive for an ssd for certain. Otherwise this system is a bit old and impractical to upgrade any other part. A newer graphics card would be held back quite a lot by the old CPU.,Negative
Intel,"If you really want to stretch out your system, you could probably find an i7-6700 cheap.

Intel,Buy a used GPU. People swap them out for the latest generation all the time even though it's still good. This upgrade I just did is the first time I ever bought a new GPU. My old RX5700xt served me well. I was just wanting to go 1440p,Positive
Intel,"If you plan on gaming, build the PC around the GPU.  GPU's are the most expensive part of a gamers' system.  If you want to enjoy video games, you need a great video card.  Motherboard, CPU, and RAM are best as combo deals.  AMD wins the budget.  SSD's are nice, fast and quiet... but you get less storage space for the price.  A power supply can usually be found cheap, just make sure it's 650w or higher, and is enough for the GPU.  Stick with well known brands if possible.  A good monitor is also important.  Many to choose from, and you likely already have one.  The choice of PC case is the most personal aspect.  Hopefully you've got a modern one with good airflow.  Don't buy a cheap keyboard or mouse... they will affect your input performance.  Always get a backlit keyboard.",Positive
Intel,"It is technically possible to upgrade it, you just won't get the best bang for your buck. But here's what to do if you don't want to replace the whole system:  CPU: Replace with an i7 that fits your board, the best performing one is the i7 7700K, followed by the i7 6700K/i7 7700 and then the i7 6700. Don't overpay for a better performing model, just get the cheapest one from these 4 you can find.  RAM: Check your task manager, and look at the number of RAM slots filled. If it says 2 of 2 slots filled, get a 2x8GB kit. If it says 2 of 4 slots filled, buy a 2x4GB kit that's the same speed(MHz) as your current RAM. If it says 1 of 2 or 1 of 4 slots filled, buy a single 8GB stick that's the same speed as your current RAM.  Storage: Get another SSD for your games, it'll be much faster than your Hard Drive.  GPU: I'd recommend trying to get an RTX 2060 SUPER or RTX 2060 12GB version, or RTX 3060 12GB version. Make sure your PSU can support the power draw from the GPU.",Neutral
Intel,Agreed. There’s not really a worthwhile upgrade path here. Moving from an HDD to an SSD is going to feel like a whole new system though. It’s one of the most impactful upgrades you can make to a computer.,Neutral
Intel,"Ah, that’s too bad. I didn’t have too much hope since the old gal is well over a decade old now, but I figured it’d be worth it to check. Guess I’ll be saving up for a bit and sending her out to pasture 😭",Negative
Intel,Well you could get a used graphics card like a 1060 for around $70-$80 but I just don't think that's a good use of your money.,Negative
Intel,"I was in a similar situation and I went b580 since the price difference was just too high, I have no problem with the card and I play everything I want in 1440p. It really depends, if you have to save money for a bit then it becomes complicated since there's no guarantee prices won't hike up again, but if you can afford it now then go 9060xt, it will last you longer even though it's more expensive. Xess 3 however made me realize this card will last me a good while with no issue.",Neutral
Intel,"I bouht a 9060 XT last month because of the Nvidia production shortage that's coming this year. I think the B580 is the play here at these price points still a good GPU regardless, it's not like you won't be able to game on it.",Positive
Intel,"The 9060 XT 16gb is like 30% faster than the B580, AMD's drivers are better than Intel's.      9060 XT 16gb is a much better GPU and is definitely worth paying more for. 2 months ago the 9060 XT was MSRP. If it was MSRP right now, would you buy it? If yes, you should just pay more, if you can afford it. You already know what you want, buy it.    I'm not telling you to eat plain rice for a month to get the 9060 XT, but Intel GPUs are the ultra budget option. It's not really a like-for-like comparison imo.",Positive
Intel,9060XT 16 Gb.,Neutral
Intel,"Having personally tested both of these GPUs I must say that 9060 XT is far superior and you should definitely go for that one if you can.   Btw it was 450 euro here in Serbia three months ago when my brother bought it, so maybe you saw an 8 GB variant which costs that much.  If you're planning to use the gpu for several years, definitely go for the 9060 XT.",Positive
Intel,"CS2, Valorant, and R6 are CPU limited games, so they'd perform about the same, the big performance difference would be apparent in Cyberpunk @ 1440p.   You do still occasionally get deals for them, last month there was one for the 9060 XT 16 GB for 366€ but there's none right now. I'd say try to get a deal somehow.

Intel,Miniforum has some good options. I did a barbones 7945hx tossed in ssd ram and gpu. All in under 1k. Works great.,Positive
Intel,"Dude, PS5s go for $250 now. Yes, spending $1500--6x the current market price of a PS5--will significantly outperform the console.",Neutral
Intel,I just built a pc for just under $1600 with a 9600x and a 5070 and it blows away the ps5 easily. obviously it costs a ton more but I also use it for work so I'm not worried about that.,Neutral
Intel,With the way shit going right now console definitely looking better but at the end of the day no way in hell would I ever go back to paying that monthly subscription to use that shit,Negative
Intel,"The two prebuilts mentioned in this thread from microcenter are your best bets  It's just a terrible time to build a PC, and once again prebuilts are probably your best value just like during the GPU shortage a few years ago.   Consoles are unique in the way they have custom AMD hardware and optimization happening behind the scenes to make smooth locked 60/120 fps possible at 1080p, 1440p, and ""4k"". Their actual hardware, comparing specs to today, are pretty low end. That optimization squeezes more performance out of it.  All that being said, the $1500 build I would say is still probably better than a PS5. The $1700 build absolutely is.",Negative
Intel,Yes I’m in Chicago and have a micro center about 20 mins from me,Neutral
Intel,"Perfect I will check it out, thank you! Does this build have decent potential for upgrades down the line?",Positive
Intel,Excellent thank you!,Positive
Intel,I’ve had it since release and I want to start playing steam games and fps games with better everything,Positive
Intel,"[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/tqnBmL](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/tqnBmL)  Roughly what to get. The $500 7700x+mobo+32gb ram bundle, and they have an RX 9070 for $599 (I just selected the cheapest on pcpartpicker but manually changed price.  Different case of course and probably can get a better psu. Also I imagine can get a better deal on NVMe  If you can splurge, the 7800x3d bundle is $100 more, will easily last you without having to think about changing the CPU for 5 years.",Neutral
Intel,The only really upgrade I would do on this is if down the line you want more power sell the GPU and grab a 5080 :) other then that maybe pop in another 32gb of ram and some more storage,Neutral
Intel,"It's not a Dell/HP workstation and doesn't have proprietary components. Most likely will just need a GPU upgrade some time down the line, 7800X3D will be highly relevant for a very very long time and you won't need more ram unless you'll find yourself deeply attached to simulation games. And storage is always easy to add (assuming prices get slightly less absurd by the time you'll need it, physically it's very easy to add a lot of storage).",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, fair, im just saying that there’s no reason to speculate whether or not there will be a significant quality jump from $250 to $1500 worth of hardware.",Neutral
Intel,"Strongly recommend saving up a bit more and going RX 9060 XT 16GB, or RX 6900 XT 16GB is also fine.",Positive
Intel,"I run an RTX 3080 10GB and play at 3440x1440.  It can handle most games well enough at high settings, so I would go for that. For 1080p, you wouldn't have to upgrade really ever in the future until the GPU itself starts kicking the bucket.",Positive
Intel,"3080 is significantly faster than a 4060 and has 2GB more in VRAM if you’re talking about the 10GB model. It’s honestly a great deal at that cost and would out perform for 1080p and even allow you to got to a 1440p probably.   The 6900XT is probably more on par with the 3080, but more VRAM on that model and more expensive. The 6800XT is probably more expensive as well with more VRAM (might be slower than the 3080). At 1080p, these 8GB models are probably fine for you.   I think the 3080 is ideal for the performance/cost. All of your options are fine for 1080p though in general.",Positive
Intel,Your 2060s can’t play old games at 1080p? What games are you looking to play? I haven’t hit a game yet I can’t play at 1080/60 with a very similar rig (5500/2070),Neutral
Intel,"You want AMD for lower CPU overhead compared to Nvidia and especially Intel. 9060XT 16GB is the best option, below that the 8GB variant is still okay, but 8GB can limit you in a lot of new games. Otherwise you can go RX 6000/7000, however RDNA4 improves on many aspects like RT, upscaling, encoding etc.",Positive
Intel,I'd go for the 3080. I had the 3070ti and it was the perfect 1080p card for max/ultra settings on any game.,Positive
Intel,Get the RTX 3080 I own a RTX 3070 Ti,Neutral
Intel,"Id say 5060s, but really aim for 5070 imo. You could save little bit more and get a better gpu that'll be worthwhile.  If youre committed, save whatever money you have, take your time, and get a fresh desktop. That way, when you do get a NASA computer, you dont have to worry for years and enjoy with all your hearts content.",Positive
Intel,"3080 would be my pick, as it is the most powerful and still has access to the latest DLSS version  I use mine for 1440p still, although I'm not one to play the latest AAA games or use the highest settings. So the 10gb of VRAM isn't an issue for me.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah I'd really like to get the 9060xt 16gb but it goes way beyond my budget, every one that I've seen is over $450",Negative
Intel,16gb while offering lots of longevity is grossly overkill for 1080p,Neutral
Intel,What about the b580? Is it good?,Neutral
Intel,"Tbh it's more like a 1650 or a 2060 non super, cause it's from a Chinese brand that limits its performance. Tho I don't have any complaints so far on old games, it doesn't hold up well on newer AAA",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, leaning towards that one or the b580.",Neutral
Intel,The B580 is around what 300? They normally advertise it as an entry level 1440p but would be great for 1080p. Comes with decent VRAM as well at 12GB. I think it’s a good option if you’re around that 300 mark.  The 3080 is still the better option though imo cause they’re so close in price.,Positive
Intel,B580 is peak but it's a bit worse than even 8gb competitors when it comes to 1080p,Negative
Intel,Why would the performance be limited? It’s the same GPU chip regardless of brand.,Neutral
Intel,"Gotcha. A 30 series card will do the latest version of DLSS which should get you all the way there. If you’re going new, anything should get you 1080/60. I’d go for a 5060 or a 9060 if you’re budget conscious - I’m not sure you have the CPU overhead with a 5600 for a b580. Those tend to be more demanding with their drivers.",Neutral
Intel,I picked up a gently used 2080 S for a friend for $145 who was still rocking a 1660.   Still very good for a 1080p build. I’d but something cheap and used and wait this whole mess out.,Positive
Intel,I think upgrading the CPU Mobo here would be good. 2500k is incredibly dated way more than the GPU. GPU upgrade after the cpu would be ok. But cpu i think should go first.,Neutral
Intel,"Upgrading the CPU + motherboard would be a  bigger upgrade than that GPU.  Does the computer have a HDD or ssd? Because if it's that old, there's a good chance it's still running off of a hard drive, and upgrading to a SSD would make a huge difference.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for all input.  To answers a couple of questions it has 500gb ssd, 500w power supply and a Ruix case (don’t really know much about the case other than it looks great).  Newegg_PC_Support posted a link to the exact CPU/Motherboard/Ram combo I was talking about in my post.  I think I’ll go with the CPU upgrade option for his birthday.  He can start saving up for a better GOU down the road.  A few of you mentioned we might gotten scammed or at least over paid a little - you are likely correct.  I’ll justify the extra $100 or $150 as the cost for me and my son to learn about/upgrade/build his PC together.   Once again, I really appreciate all the help and advice, thanks!",Positive
Intel,"The machine you got from Marketplace is about 12 years old, so some things are critical to confirm   \- Does it have a newer power supply above 550w?    \- Does it have a solid state drive? (above 500gb) This is a must  The Intel ARC Cards aren't great on older hardware so your next step is to find something modern (most likely still used).

Intel,"I agree with the other repliers that you should upgrade the CPU MB and Memory first, we have thos COMBO listed [https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4853120](https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails?ItemList=Combo.4853120) that fits your sons budget. Feel free to contract CS for more information!",Positive
Intel,"I would 100% get the new cpu, mobo, ram set first. I'm honestly shocked someone other than an enthusiast would even know about the arc gpus. Can't say I would 100% recommend for someone who doesn't know how to troubleshoot just yet as it is a very new department for Intel. Cpu first though",Neutral
Intel,"Which Ryzen 5 and which Arc? I'm assuming it's a Ryzen 5 5500 and Arc A750, but the Ryzen will offer a lot more of a performance increase than just a GPU upgrade. The current CPU is quite old and will hold back the performance of a modern GPU, so upgrading the CPU makes the most sense for now.",Neutral
Intel,Def the CPU/Mobo/RAM. 1000%  Later look for a used or refurbished GPU. GTX 1660 supers are pretty decent and readily available for around $150.,Positive
Intel,"Any intel card on a platform that doesn’t have resizable Bar will perform horribly, so do the platform first. Also what intel arc card sells for 230$ with 8gb of vram? Because the b570 with 10gb should be around that price too and is a little more stable with the drivers.",Negative
Intel,"Just to add are you anywhere near a micro center because there’s a really strong cpu bundle if you can stretch to $350 with ram and a motherboard. It’ll get you onto a current gen platform that could last well into the middle of the 2030s. Again I know this is over your intended budget but it’ll give you the performance very similar to the best am4 cpus at a lower cost.   https://www.microcenter.com/product/5007290/amd-ryzen-5-7500x3d,-msi-b850m-vc-pro-wifi-am5,-gskill-flare-x5-series-16gb-ddr5-6000,-computer-build-bundle",Positive
Intel,Ryzen 5 + mobo + ram for $250 is your first upgrade. Then toss in a nvme and a used gpu down the road and this will be an awesome budget rig.,Positive
Intel,"That or throw down on an 800 dollar system on eBay. At this point, it’s a starting point. I have a 15 year old nephew running off a 6700k and a 1070 and 32gb on 4 2.5 ssds in a raid 0 array. Had a 1080ti it took a shit, put in a 1070 and upgraded the ram from 16gb to 32 I’m not the parent, just help. It just has to work.",Negative
Intel,"Unfortunately that motherboard uses DDR3 type memory which is not compatible with the Ryzen. So you would have to add new RAM into the price, which will increase the cost quite a bit.     Unfortunately that system is no longer very upgradeable. About the only thing I can think of is, does it have a hard drive instead of an SSD? A new SSD would be a big help if it has a hard drive.",Negative
Intel,"Get an arc B570 10GB for 199USD or arc B580 12GB, the whole system needs overhaul but this way you can push it for longer, get him a 2700K on eBay for 5-8$usd as well.",Neutral
Intel,"Agree. While both parts are really really old a cpu with more than 4 cores 4 threads will be helpful.   For a considerable upgrade an AM4 Ryzen 2nd or 3rd gen (5th if money allows) with an A320 or B350/B450/B550 board, DDR4 16GB ram, and even money on top for a card like an RX6600 is possible. PSU needs to be compatible but it's not too difficult, just hope it isn't dodgy.  I know OP didn't ask for this and I'm not sure when the initial PC was bought for 320$, but unless the power supply and case are very convincingly modern/expensive, I'm sorry to say you were scammed.  There is a chance of picking up an i7 2600k or 2700k for 10 bucks and overclocking it on top for a performance uplift as well. Getting a gtx1080 level card would still be okay with such a CPU. Just that within the budget for upgrades that was mentioned it doesn't make sense to keep most parts if deals can be had.",Neutral
Intel,yup. dis is da wei. CPU upgrade first before GPU upgrade if budget is an issue. also sometimes a GPU upgrade also means a PSU upgrade.,Neutral
Intel,After you upgrade the mobo and cpu the GPU will be an easy enough upgrade by comparison.   I suggest going with a good AMD(Radeon) gpu option because they offer good price to performance  and there are a lot of good budget options and if you go higher on budget youll get better performance from AMD vs NVIDIA typically at your price range. If you are spending less than 600 on a gpu i cant in good conscious recommend NVIDIA.,Positive
Intel,That would be a massive upgrade.   Curious- how much GPU usage does he get with the current CPU when playing games?,Neutral
Intel,"I think if my friend’s 3060 eventually bites the dust, I’ll recommend him an Intel Arc. He runs a low budget (as low as that was possible given prices) AM5 system I put together for him but his 3060 only got its first use this year, so it might still have at least 5 years on it.",Neutral
Intel,"His upgrade path is:     >\-A Ryzen 5 + motherboard + 16GB DDR4 bundle for around $250  Which includes the memory  Anyway, the SSD is a good suggestion",Positive
Intel,"They said ryzen 5 + motherboard. Yes, the new motherboard they would buy should work",Neutral
Intel,"Arc cards are not worth it without rebar support, as intel mentions themself. Also with a cpu that old, the overhead issues will be horrific.",Negative
Intel,"I would agree.  That mobo+CPU+ram combo on eBay would easily be under $50.  So the rest of the money went to case, fans, PSU, and GPU.  It's not the worst scam of all time or anything, but depending on the rest of the parts, it was at least likely overpriced.",Negative
Intel,"I wouldn't go Arc, a lot of driver issues, game without proper support and no idea if intel will keep that part of their business afloat to give proper support in the next years... Given that, ARC is on really enthusiastic side of it, I would just throw that curve ball on him if he really likes to do this kind of stuff",Negative
Intel,That may have been edited - I'm really sure the memory part was not there when I replied.,Negative
Intel,Upgrade the system later on B580 12Gb now makes sense why upgrade now to upgrade later meaning in near future?? Don't want to buy obsolescence,Neutral
Intel,Because youre suggesting an upgrade that doesnt make sense to do first,Negative
Intel,What's kinda budget you working with? Or price range you want to try to stay within?,Neutral
Intel,"[This looks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWzk6J09n_A) like your CPU should support roughly double the FPS.  So yes, if you want more FPS you can just upgrade the GPU or lower the graphics settings.",Neutral
Intel,"You can probably fit in about a 250W GPU with a 500W PSU.  9070 is the best newer GPU that comes in under that limit, which is about 2.5x better than your 3060.",Positive
Intel,Yeah it’ll be worth it.,Positive
Intel,9060XT is the first GPU that's worth it ish new.,Neutral
Intel,"5700x won't bottleneck because it's still a good cpu, but with the 500w psu and a budget of around 400-500 the 9060xt would be the best option because it's power efficient and has enough vram for 1440p, 16gb.",Positive
Intel,"The GPU is close to max but the CPU is questionable.  Is task manager CPU performance view set to a single graph or 16 logical core graphs?  You might be surprised to find out that several individual cores are actually maxed out. Upgrading the GPU would not help (much) in that case.  Either way, the GPU only has 10% left in it.",Neutral
Intel,"i dont know, i see the 3060 going for $250 can maybe add another 250 so $500Can ish.",Neutral
Intel,"I wouldn't go that far. A 5700X would still bottleneck a 5080. 5070 is the highest I would go. If a 7900X3D can bottleneck a 4090, then the 5700X would definitely limit the performance of a 5080",Negative
Intel,I see 5060 8gb for $500 or 5060ti 16gb for $700 how do they compare to the 9070? thanks,Neutral
Intel,the 9060xt 16gb(160w) used less power than my 3060 12gb(170w) is that correct?,Neutral
Intel,"I'm still new to PCs so I just open the task manager and look at the performance, no sure if there a better way to check for this.  It does look like the GPU is at the max.  The graphics does look great on 1080p Ultra, which is what I play on, but I'd eventually like to play on 1440p ultra.",Neutral
Intel,Maybe a 9060 xt 16gb?,Neutral
Intel,9070 competes against 5070.   What is the exact model of power supply? It will matter if you're going for a more power hungry card like 9070 or an older used card like 4070 Super/Ti.,Neutral
Intel,"9070 is better, it competes with the 5070.",Positive
Intel,"Check tpu relative ranking for rough gpu performance guidelines. The guy who told you it was only 60% faster than your 3060 is way off, its more like 2.4 times faster on average. But arc raiders is nvidia favoured. The 9070 will still beat the 5060ti despite the game being nvidia favoured.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, it uses less power and has more performane or ""power"" related to the fps, so that's why newer stuff is better.",Positive
Intel,Open the task manager again  Goto the performance graph for the CPU  Right click the graph  Change Graph To -> Logical Processors.,Neutral

Intel,"I’ve seen people talking about these kinds of issues on the MSI forums.  You may want to consider going through a few BIOS versions for your board and see if any of them offer a better experience.  Also just out of curiosity, try using GPU-Z and seeing if your PCI-E mode is switching from 5x to 1x when this is going on.  This is another common problem I’ve read about on the MSI forums.  The BIOS updates could address this as well.",Neutral

Intel,the 5050 and 5060 are priced at basically the same pont where im at so id never consider a 5050 however id still go with a b580 over a 5060 because of the 12 GB Vram same goes for the RX 7600,Neutral
Intel,Wait and get a 5060 if you can otherwise the 5050.,Neutral
Intel,"Save for the 9060XT, even the 8GB version is over 30% faster than any of these, apart from when everything but the B580 runs out of vram due to its 4GB extra. However the B580 also has CPU overhead issues (Intel has it worst, then Nvidia, and AMD has the least overhead).",Positive
Intel,B580 easily of the options you have shown.  If you can save a little more the 9060XT is a great 1080p-1440p card.,Positive
Intel,"New cards make little sense at this price point, look for good deals on used market instead.",Positive
Intel,"Depends on the price. Are you in the USA?  B580 might not perform well with your 5500 cpu  I would go 7600, they were available for less than $200 but I don't know recent pricing.  If I was going to spend $200 on a video card I would go 3070 all day. Get one on ebay with their guarantee.",Neutral
Intel,"For $250-300 which is average price for these cards I would look for a used card like a 3070ti/3080 or 7700xt, yes it's overkill for the r5 5500 but that means you won't need to upgrade as soon. Plus if you have a 650w good quality psu it should be plenty for these cards",Neutral

Intel,Used RTX 3080 for ~$300,Neutral
Intel,"I think focusing on a GPU upgrade is smart. If you want to go with new components, I think you need to decided if you spend $250 to get a solid upgrade, and pocket the $100 for other stuff; or spend $350 and get an ever better GPU upgrade, but then have spent it all. Used market could really help.here, or it could be bust, that's just the nature of things. A B350 is tempting, if you are sure it's driver splay nicely with your games (IIRC, Intel.GPUs had the most compatibility issues with older games, which matches your game list, idk, maybe these have been resolved). Talking new: at the $250 end you have the B350 and the RTX5050; you then can take a step up to the 9060xt and rtx5060, but that gets you closer to $350 and starts presenting vram questions.   CPU; idk, I think I would want to upgrade to an 8 core, and a 5700x is in your budget, but can't really fit in with a GPU also. Probaly best to focus on GPU first.",Positive

Intel,5600x and 9060xt is your best bet,Positive
Intel,Since you already have an AM4 mobo the 5600xt makes more sense than getting the 14400 and a new LGA 1700 board. Look into the 5800xt as well.   The 5060 is 20%+ stronger than the b580. I’d rather get the faster card over the extra vram. Since longevity is important to you I would recommend the 9060xt 16GB. It’s the best card of the bunch by far.   I would get the GPU first then upgrade the CPU. I don’t expect the cpu prices to change much.,Positive
Intel,"I built a home server with 32gb ddr4, 5600XT, and a 5060. It games pretty well for what it is. Like others said, a 16gb card is a better idea for long term.   The 5600xt performs great.",Positive
Intel,"First, avoid the 8GB cards. If you want this to last for years, plan ahead with the VRAM. I know you didn't list AAA-titles, but you could catch the GTA6 bug.  Ignoring ray tracing, dlss, cuda and the 8gb cards and **WILDLY** over-simplifying, you get this for relative card performance:  Card | Street Price | bogoFPS :----|:----|:--- 5090 | $3700 | 175 5080 | $1300 | 125 5070TI | $950 | 113 9070XT | $730 | 109 9070 | $630 | 100 5070 | $620 | 92 5060TI | $525 | 66 9060XT | $440 | 63 B580 | $300 | 48 B570 | $250 | 42  *bogoFPS is based off TechPowerUp relative performance at 1440p*  The 14400f is a better pick over the 5600x, as it's competitive with the [5800X in gaming](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-core-i5-14400-cpu-review/3), but honestly both are good. One sizable advantage for the 14400f is you can switch to ddr5 without buying a new cpu - just upgrade motherboard and memory.",Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for the input! The 8gb of VRAM on my RX590 probably is the reason it lasted so long, so your advice is well received. So the question now is, would 12gb be enough? Or should I go for the RX 9060 as the definitive pick?   As for the CPU, I've considered i5-12600KF as it was recommended over 14400f, but at €170 (that is without a fan - effectively pushing the price to €200) would it be worthy upgrade over 14400?",Positive
Intel,This is an incredible comment! This could answer at least 30% of the posts on this sub. Top notch 👏.,Positive
Intel,">would 12gb be enough   *I* would go big here, especially as the price difference isn't massive and the performance is so much better. You're not just paying for VRAM, the card is all-around better  >RX 9060*XT 16GB* as the definitive pick?    If I had money to get a new GPU, I'd get the following depending on my budget:  1. 5070ti 2. 9070XT 16GB 3. 9070 16GB 4. 9060XT 16GB 5. B580  >worthy upgrade over 14400?  **I** would get the 12th Gen because I don't trust Intel 13/14.

Intel,Definitely try find an a380. Similar encode decode with the latest cards and much cheaper.,Positive
Intel,"Thanks to all who took the time to reply. The A380 (or rather: Pro40) was high on my list.  Interestingly, the search results about its support for >60Hz changed dramatically from yesterday into the opposite.  However, over at the intel arc subreddit, there still is a comment about the A380 not supporting 4k refreshrates >60Hz.  I would like to avoid the 5xx Series, A or B, due to their high power consumption. Same is probably true for AMDs 7xxx Series.  Edit: At least for their Pro cards, on their support site, intel reccomends DP40 cables, which are capable of uncompressed 4K at 144HZ.

Intel,Still using 25.8.1 for Path of Exile 2 and even then I still crash from time to time using both Vulkan and DX12. I'm using Vulkan now because it can recover most times from a graphical crash where as DX12 will crash to desktop. The only thing with Vulkan is fog renders in squares and so maps have a checkered pattern overlayed on top of them with stuff like delirium and other fog effects.   I've done full reinstalls of Windows from nothing and still see this effect.,Neutral

Intel,"I welcome the Nioh 3 support, but AMD can't ignore people upset with them forever.",Neutral
Intel,Looks like the install manager doesn't see this as an optional driver and same when you uninstall it and just do a check for updates so manually downloading it right now.,Negative
Intel,"The reason why these drivers are so ...underwhelming... is, the consumer computing market is currently dead. This affects everything from PC parts, prebuilts, consoles, smartphones. There is zero incentive to update drivers, make fixes or add new features (FSR4 Int8) when the enterprise AI-driven market has so much higher margins. No new consumer GPUs are in sight this calendar year, so customer/consumer retention is no reason at all. AMD deserves the same blame as Nvidia.

I went deep down the rabbit hole trying to find a solution but there are none that stick.

Intel,Exactly.,Neutral
Intel,"Because the developers are lying about the game using FSR 3.1. In reality, it's FSR 3.0, which is built into the game engine, without the separate DLL files that AMD provided several years ago. Therefore, it's impossible to enable FSR4 in the game because the driver doesn't recognize the DLL files, which need to be overridden.

Intel,They post the known issues so that people don't keep sending them reports about the same thing constantly. They will be working on a fix which can take time.,Negative
Intel,The Nioh 3 devs are to blame for not implementing FSR3.1 properly. There is no external dll (amd\_fidelityfx\_dx12.dll) in the game directory so Adrenalin cannot hook into it to upgrade to FSR4.,Negative

Intel,"I don't see any value in this software for my setup. It constantly hogs 200-300MB of VRAM in the background while offering zero interesting features, at least for the RX 7700 XT.

Features like AFMF or Sharpening? Optiscaler does a much better job, plus it's a must-have for FSR4 in certain titles. The Hyper-RX/Quality/Power Saving profiles are pure cringe, and I'd throw Radeon Boost, Chill, and Anti-Lag into the same garbage bin.

It still looks better than playing at 1440p Quality/balance mode. Combine with using RIS2 and a slight overclock, the performance is not bad at all.  You could also just use fsr4 performance mode at 3200x1800, overall better experience than playing at native 1440p.  Path tracing even without any additional help from NRC, Ray regeneration and the help of the devs optimisation is still a viable option on the 9070xt.

Intel,"That reg tweak does not work on latest builds as far i know, and there new tweaks you can do as well now, because its capable of kicking out stuff from MPO if it does not meet certain threshold now as well",Negative
Intel,"I don't think it was done on purpose. It's just unfortunate that a certain feature is clashing with how rdna4 handles path tracing. I tried cyberpunk path tracing on my 7800xt previously numerous times and didn't get any crashes, the only issue was a lack of performance.   This fix looks like it has to come from the developers side. And we know their priority is for Nvidia.",Negative
Intel,"tbf Nvidia sabotaging AMD is very likely, wouldn't be the first time.   But it's also very likely AMD just doesn't have or want to spend the ressources to get that resolved, lol.

Intel,"I just got the card recently so I haven't done too much tuning yet. Unfortunately it doesn't have a dual BIOS (RX 9070 Challenger).

Intel,"It may very well be a wow problem, but when it occurs in games using completely different engines, I feel it's more of a driver issue.  I don't play WoW with raytracing, even then, I tried many different option types and the crashes still happen.   I've come to the conclusion some time ago that I can't fix it and I just have to live with random crashes until either Blizzard or AMD does something.",Negative
Intel,"It crashes regardless of OC or not, my buddy with a 7800XT gets the same errors and it doesn't matter whether it's Retail or Classic WoW or whether it's directX11 or 12, low or highest setting. Unfortunately I don't ever think I will get a fix, despite reporting the error everytime.  The problem is that it's so random. I can play regularly for a month+ no problem and sometimes it crashes 3 times within an hour. Never saw it crash 4 times, yet anyway...  Only OC I have is my RAM @ 6000Mhz, but my friend has no and runs on default speed.   As said, only problem is WoW and Endfield(in some areas of the game, not all).",Negative

Intel,At least nVidia has cleaned them up.  AMD's drivers just keep getting worse.,Negative
Intel,"Not true , my GF got a 3070 and installed EVERY SINGLE update.  No issues infact her performance slightly improved in certain games and got giant DLSS upgrades.  Meanwhile the 6800XT i have is my first amd GPU in like 10 years and i have DDU permanently on my PC because the driver randomly breaks in some way and i need to DDU to get it back to normal.  Like right now the amd interface wont autostart anymore ( i added it to the startup folder for now cause i dont want to DDU AGAIN )     if the memory craze wouldnt be here i would have bought THIS MONTH a 5070TI for me and my wife.",Positive
Intel,"I bought the amd 6xxx series for my two pcs but before that, I had Nvidia, and I never had issues with nvidia drivers.   Amd has always given me issues at some point when I bought em.  Had an hd 7870 that had some issue with final fantasy XIV, which was and is my main game.   The game kept crashing, so I thought the card was bad, so I rma for another card. New card same issue. So I just tell em send me whatever the equivalent Nvidia card you have. I got a 660ti, and it just worked.  Bought myself a 770 and 980ti, which both worked no issues.  The computer died right as I moved for a new job, so I just needed something cheap, so I bought an Rx580, and while it was mostly fine, it still had a few crashes.  The 3060 I got later had zero issues.  I have s 6800xt and a 6900xt and im on some older driver (like maybe 2 or 3 drivers ago) because when I update (full clean with DDU and all), i get crashes when I game.   Nvidia may have had driver issues last year, but I doubt their issues overall are as consistent as amd.  Last amd card I remember having no issues was my 5770 and my x850xt back when.",Neutral

Intel,"Huh? What's that got to do with noise suppression? There was already open source AI solutions well before AMD or Nvidia implemented them, such as RNNoise. It's not something that AMD or Nvidia specifically need to create but looking around, it seems it's still a bit a slow area in regards to AI advancements. There's DeepFilterNet but it hasn't really been updated in years though there's been a lot of claims of progress of DeepFilterNet3 with I'm assuming private branches.

Intel,I'll have to look into that mod,Neutral
Intel,"Yh, some of the flaws would actually be resolved with a good denoiser. If you turn off Ray reconstruction on my 5070, shimmering/flickering is very noticeable with dlss. Ray reconstruction actually stabilize the image and can add certain details, so the upscaler is not doing all of the work visually. AMD RR would definitely be a game changer. Unfortunately I can't see the devs going back to optimise path tracing and include RR specifically for AMD.",Neutral

Intel,Nvidia cant make a driver that doesnt shit itself whenever windows updates so,Negative
Intel,"No thanks, I play games that don't work on Linux (yes Kernel lvl anti cheat)   Also, I'm a software dev for windows applications.   And also, what does switching to linux have to do with the whole topic?  And I need FSR 4 Because FSR 3 looks significantly worse then even XESS on it's fallback mode a lot of the times and even the 7900XTX needs upscaling for pretty much any RT game, and no I am not turning down settings on a 1200€ GPU (when I bought it)",Negative
Intel,"Yeah that sucks :c but the bonus RT performance, the WAAAAAY better upscaler + the fact that most of these software features get actually used in games, still keeps me happy",Positive

Intel,"No. Optiscaler is not missing anything to make PT/RT stable. I think you are getting confused when dlss inputs are used and PT is enabled, Ray reconstruction is automatically enabled which doesn't work on AMD gpus, so the denoising looks grainy or not 100% rendered, which then boost performance. When xess/fsr inputs are used then Ray reconstruction is disabled, therefore only the in-game denoiser is being used and everything is rendered properly.  Optiscaler doesn't make PT anymore stable or less stable. Optiscaler produces overall better quality visuals than the in-game fsr4, because it uses the correct fsr 4 models for each quality settings. but that's it.   Disabling sharc doesn't boost performance on my 9070xt and doesn't change anything visually.",Neutral

Most invasive kernel-level anticheat games either don't support FSR 3.1 anyway or they don't need upscaling at all, since they're e-sports optimized games (also why are you allowing ring zero access to third party corpos?). The rest will work perfectly, which is about 95% of FSR 4 supported titles.   And yes, I agree that FSR 3 obviously looks much worse since it doesn't have any intelligent upscaling, just algorithmic voodoo stuff. But for native AA it's perfectly enough, from my own testing.

Intel,I’ll never understand why AMD is not committing to design RDNA4 based APUs and at this point I just take RDNA 3.5 as a joke because they can’t even support FSR4 on it officially nor the RX 7000 cards.  It’s like they are losing on purpose,Negative
Intel,"AMD has this “it’s good enough for a while and we’ll release something great that people will forget this happened”  Vega lasted in mobile for nearly 5 years and got RDNA2 designs. Now, it’s RDNA3.5 being built for mobile platform and betting on that to be good enough until RDNA5/UDNA bridge die designs releases (unverified rumor)  AMD also has this weird obsession with competitor naming. Sure, it’s meant to confuse buyers but it’s hurting them than helping, maybe it does help in terms of inventory.  They’re not intel-like of stagnation. They’re competing but not for us in the consumer market and we’re just getting scraps until enterprise trend die down (currently AI trend/bubble).  Well, it’s understandable as Zen designs are really focused in Epyc and scale down to Ryzen SKUs.  And the 400 series is a bad refresh when Ryzen 6000 mobile is the definitive refresh they have done, Zen 3+ and move to RDNA2. AMD could’ve done similar commitment but it’s not currently.

Intel,"The GPU doesn't matter if you don't have proper drivers and they are so far behind still Intel.   Great progress, but the drivers are still going to be the thing that makes people say no.

I'm talking past DirectX games, you can't just worry about the new games there's games that are older that don't run well.   It took AMD many many years to get decent drivers, Intel I don't know if they're just focusing on hardware and not the drivers, but that so far is what's been holding it back.

The top of the line x9 388h is about ~10% faster in single core aka the only thing that matters and will probably be in 2500€+ laptops whereas my 7 350 is in 500€ laptops.  I tried a 285h laptop besides the AI 7 350 and not only did it run hotter and less efficient, it also felt less snappier.

Intel,"Both are right/wrong.  Intel made their comparisons to Strix point because they’re in the same power class. Panther lake is much faster than Strix Point at the same power level (according to Intel, AMD doesn’t deny that) at 45W.  AMD says it doesn’t matter because their Strix halo (up to 120W) is faster which is pretty obvious.   It’s not technically lying, AMD is just referencing an entirely different class of product.",Neutral

Intel,"You’ve got it backwards. The majority of laptops use IGPUs. IGPUs being as powerful as integrated graphics allows for cheaper thinner devices that are more power efficient. The entire intel CPU/IGPU performs on par with a 4050 at 60w at only 45w. When you factor in the 10-15w the CPU takes with the 4050 and you’re looking at similar performance at like half the power.

Intel,"It's not the 4050 at 60W. The laptop they compared only allows for 30W to the 4050. Nvidia's specs for the 4050 is 35W minimum, so I don't know how Dell even got to 30W. Below a certain wattage, gpu performance decreases exponentially because a minimum level of power is required to even have the gpu turned on.   Panther Lake is built on Intel 18A, which is supposed to be much better than the 'ancient' TSMC 5nm the 4050 is built on. The 4050's cpu is also Arrow Lake, which is less efficient than Lunar Lake. Again, that skews the agenda.   You can already game on thin and light devices with discrete graphics. Laptops like Asus's G14 is only 3.3lb, but sports a 4060 which is like twice as fast as intel's new igpu. The dgpu turns itself off when on battery, and the integrated graphics takes over. Anything more intensive should be used with a charger plugged in.   In short, paying for a big igpu doesn't make much sense for anyone interested in performance. And gaming handhelds? Does anyone really care about those useless bricks for investment into integrated graphics? It's not like the cost of Panther Lake is going to be cheap when its laptops start at $1300. With that kind of money, you can get 2025 Asus Zephyrus G14 with a 5060 and blow its shit out the water. Or for those on a budget, 5050 laptops have been seen for $600.   Integrated graphics have come so far, pairing Intel's newest 18A Panther Lake with an RTX 4050 could still make a lot of sense.",Negative
Intel,"Ehh not the mayority but *all* computers use iGPUs. The thing is, for the average Joe aka 95% of the market, there won't be a difference in the usage between an Intel Iris or RTX 5090 dGPU. And the efficiency would only come into place if they would game on battery (who does that anyways) or create/edit videos (again, virtually no one would do that without a dGPU). And even then, having your laptop drained in 2 hours 15 minutes instead of 2 hours is not ""gamechanging""   So it does not affect the efficiency at all during webbrowsing, watching videos, creating documents etc.  Thats also the reason why Intel has the non X 5,7,9 which will properly be by far the more demanded version as, again, the average Joe does not care the slightest about iGPU.  And apart from the iGPU, PTL is just a tiny step up from the Ultra 200 series...",Neutral

Intel,"How are you determining that AMD has a ""lead""?  In terms of Marketshare, Intel absolutely dominates x86, especially mobility (laptops), and if you walk into a Best Buy and ask 10 random customers ""Would you ever consider buying an AMD laptop?"", five of them would ask ""What's AMD?"", another three would say ""Isn't that a budget brand?"" (Their ""awareness"" of the zeitgeist of PC hardware is stuck in 2005), and maybe, and that's a big maybe, two out of ten would have a favorable opinion of AMD hardware so long as they've been paying attention for the last few years.  In terms of budget and expenditure, in 2025, Intel spent $17 billion in R&D versus AMD's $7.4 billion, outsizing it by a large amout. Total sales for 2025 are projected at approximately $53 billion for Intel and $33 billion for AMD.  I see this all the time and I've seen it for the past 8 years.... the only place that AMD has a ""lead"" is in the mind of PC hardware enthusiasts.... because it's not in the numbers as seen above (sales, expenditure, market share, etc), and it's not in the ""mindshare"" of your average consumer.  Hypothetically speaking, we could say that in a duopoly, as with Intel/AMD in x86, the BEST situation a consumer could hope for would be an even 50%/50% split in marketshare.... this would bring about the fiercest competition and would hopefully lower prices, increase innovation, etc. (and yet another reason why any fanboy who wants their favored company to dominate is LITERALLY cheering against their own interests as a consumer) Even with AMD's seriously impressive turnaround, their capture of marketshare, their ability to compete with two of the largest companies in the world while having considerably fewer resources, they still have a very, very, long way to go before approaching 50% of the x86 market across all segments.  In fact, to get any closer to that idealistic 50/50 split, AMD would have to continue winning and Intel losing for for many more years.  In other words, fears that AMD is ""becoming what Intel used to be"" and ""getting lazy"" are not an accurate reflection of the reality.",Neutral

It doesn’t really matter whether or not you have a 5060 or 5090 or whatever.  In mobile systems it’s a huge difference.  There are entirely different power classes that don’t compete with each other. A thin and light notebook with a 15W CPU cannot have a 100W CPU in it.  Panther lake aims towards unplugged performance which is the 45W power class and the same as Strix Point.  Strix Halo is a much higher power class that requires a laptop to be plugged in permanently for the full performance.  It’s for mobile desktops that are usually plugged in but can be mobile for some time with heavily degraded performance.  It’s an entirely different class of product and you won’t find (many) devices where Strix Halo and Strix Point/Panther Lake compete with each other.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, i am gonna contend that either that is wrong, and is the 4xe version, or that intel basically lied on their benchmarks.  If none of those two things are true, Intel's new graphics architecture will absolutely dominate in the next round of discrete graphics GPUs.  with B580 intel needed \~80% more silicon to match nvidia performance. Now they need \~10-20% less die area. meaning their performance per transistor basically doubled gen/gen. which is unheard of. Even maxwell (largest architectural uplift in the history of GPUs in the last 10 years) did not achieve anything close to that. And it was a massive overhaul with huge changes.

You cannot gang these channels into a dual channel mode, that is not how modern memory works, and there is no allowance in the LPDDR5 spec for 64b channels. The 16b channels have separate command/address buses and burst for a sufficient length (32n) to fill a cache line with each access.  To be clear I think standardising on 64b ""channels"" for marketing specifications is a good thing, it allows quick mental calculation of memory bandwidth without having to get into the nitty gritty.

It's largely hypothetical question, as I already own the GPU, am satisfied with the GPU, and of course did my due diligence before buying the GPU so I would know exactly what to expect.

Now my RX 9070 XT is not detected at all in BIOS or Windows Device Manager, and I only get display output from the motherboard.  WHAT HAPPENED To see the old SATA SSD in the boot menu I had to enable CSM in the BIOS. Booting into that drive resulted in a black screen. I then used a Live USB to run the boot-repair utility with the recommended repair settings. This seems to have installed the GRUB partition onto my Crucial T500 M.2 drive instead of the SATA drive. Now I can boot into both OSs, but the GPU is completely invisible to the system.  CURRENT STATUS Windows Device Manager only shows the Integrated Graphics. When I try to install AMD drivers, the installer fails because it cannot detect the GPU. I was briefly able to get graphics output from my GPU by unplugging the PC, flipping the PSU switch to off, and holding the power button to empty the capacitors. I then booted it up with the HDMI cable plugged into my GPU and I saw the asrock logo but it was stuck there for 2 minutes and I impatiently turned it off. I'm also considering trying this again and letting it run it's course  PLAN AND QUESTIONS I am planning to disconnect the SATA SSD and try to wipe the Ubuntu boot entries from the M.2 drive to see if the GPU reappears. Has anyone experienced a Linux bootloader repair or CSM toggle hiding a GPU from the BIOS? Specifically, could the Crucial T500 and ADATA drive conflict be causing PCIe initialization issues after the CSM change? Should I try clearing the CMOS first? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

So I said screw it, I'm gonna rebuild my PC and switch to AMD.   So I bought a MSI x870e Tomahawk Wifi Mobo, and Ryzen 9950x3d. I assembled everything, and it posts first try. Great. So I install Windows 11 and get to configuring things, removing bloat, etc, and I start having freezes. And my screens blinking off and a message telling me there was a failure and that it needs to put the graphics into safe mode.   On top of that, I was having a lot of random hiccups and lag. I checked with LatencyMon and was having all sorts of DPC latency with my Nvidia drivers. So I uninstall the drivers with DDU and install an older driver (566.36) and cool, things seem more stable. Except they're not. Now I'm getting high latency from other drivers like storage and network. So I'm thinking okay maybe it's the ram. So I run memtest86 overnight only to find my PC shut off at some point. I figured the ram must be faulty. So I took out one stick and tested it with the other and the test completed. I'm thinking okay, ram stability could explain a lot of things, so I've found the issue. So I stay with one stick and up the DRAM voltage to 1.35 to see how it goes.   I'm still getting intermittent latency. Some programs crashing, and on top of that, my PC won't shut down now.

WHAT I TRIED TO FIX IT: Overall I have tried an immense amount of things, these are the main ones I can think of: - different bios versions - different windows versions, 25h2, 24h2, 23h2 - bios changes like c states and resize bar on Vs off - pbo with a negative all core undervolt and then aida64 for stability check - windows debloating - different powerplan - different in game settings - different mouse keyboard controller settings and hard peripheral resets - brand new chipset drivers, ddu Nvidia drivers, game cache clears - Chris Titus essential tweaks - Even went as far as to download 'tweaking programs' (weirdly these made the biggest positive impact) - a bunch of other recommended and random stuff  MY SPECS: Pc: MSI B650M-P NVMe - Futwiz 1TB NVMe Crucial 32 gb DDR5 6000MHz cl36 ASUS RTX 4060 CPU Ryzen 7 9800x3d Gigabyte Gold PSU 750w Artic liquid freezer 360 AIO Peripherals: Razer viper V3 pro Steel series apex pro mini Alienware aw2523hf Gamesir g7 pro   EXTRA INFO: -my temps even while running extreme CPU stress tests are well under 70 and sit at about 50-60 In game - I have full fibre fttp with a cat6a cable etherneted directly into my pc, my pc is the only device that uses this connection - my bufferbloat scores show unloaded 9ms and download and upload of 0ms with less than 1 ms jitter on all - i never had these issues before, and my friends have not got any issues currently, so it's not game server issue  This is driving me crazy, I've spent about 3 weeks straight testing and trying to change things to help, I've done every recommended thing available on the internet and still my games feel inconsistent and mushy, I will literally pay anyone who can fix this issue for me, buying any extra hardware needed isn't an issue either, please just help.",Neutral
Intel,What is the best am4 CPU to pair with the 16gb 9060xt New and Used under 200.00  I currently have a ryzen 9 3900x and want better game performance,Positive
Intel,"9700 X Underperforming   I recently got a new system and my CPU has been underperforming both in games and in benchmarks. Specs are as follows:  9700X  9070 XT Gigabyte OC  Asus B650E Max Motherboard  2 x 16GB Orion 5 DDR5 Ram 6000 MHZ CL38  850 W Gold PSU  1 TB MSI Spatium 450 NVME  I’m getting 4500 in Cinebench 2026 and like 18500 in Cinebench R23 for multicore scores. I’m also short up to 20-30 percent on frames in CPU intensive games like The Finals, Overwatch, etc.  Performance is still great, but seems like I’m missing out on a fair bit of what should be expected from a 9700 X.  Is there anything that could be causing this? I’m not running PBO, and my CPU temps stays at 60 C or below when benchmarking and gaming at 100 percent utilization. The one time I set PBO to enabled, my CPU was going at 90+ C immediately when benchmarking, so I just ended the test early and turned PBO back off. I’m using a cheap Gamidas cooler on the CPU. Could that be the cause? I have some extra PTM 7950 and I could get a better cooler, but would the thermal headroom make a difference if the CPU is already staying at 60 C in benchmarks and games?",Negative

My plan is to rent a affordable dedicated server to host a gaming server, in need of ideally utilizing the full 5.1 GHz on its cores to decide whether it would be a good choice.  Is there anyone using the CPU and can report from experience or point me to a source?  Thanks a lot!",Neutral

Every time I launch Fortnite, at some point during the game (Could be seconds or minutes into the game, in the menu, between games - anything), both my monitors go completely black and I can hear the game for bit and then my computer totally crashes. This has only happened in Fortnite besides one instance when it crashed in the Epic Games LAUNCHER.  I have to restart my computer each time this happens and 50% of the time my GPU disappears from task manager, and I have to reinstall my drivers to make it show up again. (@ w @\* )  The last time this all happened, Fortnite had uninstalled ITSELF when I restarted my computer and I had to manually delete each file and redownload the launcher alongside the game itself.  Here is a list of things I have tried to resolve this issue:  \- Switch my game mode to performance  \- Switch to DX 11 from DX 12  \- Disabled integrated graphics  \- Made my GPU my primary card in both Windows and Bios  Things I know aren't wrong:  \- My GPU is plugged in correctly  So far, I believe all my specs are normal and everything is installed correctly.

Intel,"Hi. HWiNFO is a very reliable monitoring tool, so unless there is a known open issue regarding sensors for your CPU SKU, I'd trust these temp readings.  I don't use a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but the maximum operating temperature (Tjmax) for the 7800X3D is 89°C. If you're seeing temperatures over 100°C, that's likely a cooling problem that could damage your chip over time. I'd probably check my cooling system and setup if I were you. That said, another 7800X3D user might think differently, so maybe there is nothing to worry about.  Based on my experience, CPU temps over 100 °C usually indicate poor thermal management or inadequate cooling.",Neutral
Intel,"check if memory and/or fabric clocks spike at the same time (max values basically), if they do it is a sensor bug.",Neutral
Intel,You still can build a PC as long as you know where to get the parts you need at a price you can afford despite the crappy RAM and GPU prices.,Positive
Intel,"China stolen Samsung DRAM tech, this year we may have influx of chinese cheap RAM from CXMT to save us",Negative
Intel,"> how much of an improvement will I see with my RX 7900 XTX?  Up to 50% but this is assuming heavily CPU bottlenecked games (stuff like Battlefield 6, Factorio, Stellaris etc). Less than 15% in a standard AAA grade single player title if you play at 1440p. 0% if you play at 4k.   There's no single metric here as it really depends on a game. If you love 4X games like Stellaris I would upgrade. If you prefer Silent Hill or Alan Wake 2 I wouldn't.",Neutral
Intel,"It actually might make sense considering you are playing CPU heavy games at a relatively low res. I would also check if 5700X is available since it's pretty much the same thing as 5800X, except often a bit cheaper.   I see techspot actually tested BF6:  https://www.techspot.com/review/3043-battlefield-6-cpu-benchmark/#2025-10-15-image-png  3600 got 62 fps 1% lows and 86 averages whereas 5800X reached 80 fps 1% lows and 108 averages. So theoretically up to 30% better. Still, in both cases it's playable, fps dropping to 62 probably won't kill you.",Neutral
Intel,It can vary model to model. I watch search for the sku you purchased and if you can't find it try contacting the manufacture to see if they can tell you. EVGA used to be good about providing this info but it really depends.,Neutral
Intel,"CPU, motherboard and RAM yes. AM5 and DDR5 are the newest.  I don't like windows 11 and I will keep using windows 10 for as long as I can. Unless you absolutely need to upgrade I wouldn't bother.",Negative
Intel,"According to the review on that site it comes with 5200 MT/s RAM which is not ideal. 6000 matches the memory controller's speed so that's what I would recommend. It's not a big issue, only a small performance difference. Other than that it looks like a solid setup.",Negative
Intel,"The ram by itself is fine, though you'll probably need to manually set it to something like 6000 CL32. You can get the expo sticks, but the only thing that'd really change for you is the preprogrammed profile to allow you to get it with just a single setting.  The 7200 should run out of the box, but the CPU will switch into a different memory mode where it runs its memory controller at half clocks that lowers performance until about DDR5 8000, so that's why you'd go to the 6000 instead",Neutral
Intel,good point,Positive
Intel,"its definitely going to improve a noticeable amount on all 3 cases, but if you're having some issues with the second monitor a GPU upgrade would probably help more",Positive

Intel,"It's good that it doesn't happen constantly, but even if those readings occur occasionally or intermittently, it's generally not a good sign.  However, if it hasn't happened again today, and you're under similar or identical workloads to when you had those readings, you probably have nothing to worry about. It could just be a few inaccurate readings.  Continue to monitor your CPU temperatures and, if you notice occasional readings over TJmax again, it's worth checking your current thermal management (thermal paste, contacts, etc.) and cooling setup (fans, AIOs, and/or liquid cooling). Prevention is better than cure.",Neutral
Intel,"The Radeon RX 9060 XT offers the highest raw frame rates at 1080p, outperforming the competition by roughly 4-5% on average.  The RTX 5060 provides nearly identical performance but adds the advantage of DLSS 4 for superior upscaling and image quality.  While the Intel Arc B580 is the slowest card, its 12 GB of VRAM allows it to handle Ultra settings that cause the 8 GB cards to stutter.  Ultimately, the video recommends the 16 GB version of the RX 9060 XT as the best long-term choice for modern gaming.",Positive

Intel,"That would be a completely new phenomenon if you look at the past. Sure, some (probably indie) studio will optimize their games, but they would have done so already because they care about their customers.

Intel,"u/AMD_Vik Hey there! Just want to let you know that I've seen a lot of people have problems lately (including myself) with Direct-to-Display/Directmode implementations for DisplayPort/HDMI wired VR Headsets. DirectMode cannot enable reliably even on SteamVR native HMDs, and the only way to get them running right now is by installing a older driver version, enabling directmode there, and then updating to a newer version with the directmode already set -> so directmode itself still works fine, but there seem to be problems toggling into this. I also saw this happening with other VR compositors like PimaxPlay though radeon users are generally not as common there.  Happens with every driver released after and including 25.4.1 on my machine, and driver older than 25.3.1 can toggle into Directmode just fine. It is still broken as of 25.12.1 and 26.1.1  at first I thought this was a somewhat individual issue but as I've looked into it I saw more and more people have that problem with RDNA3 and RDNA4 GPUs across the board for basically any VR headset that uses Directmode.  I remember you mentioning on the AMD forums once that you want to be hit up about VR related issues - but really I didn't know how else I would reach out to you.",Negative

I recently did a fresh Windows install, and during a Windows update, the AMD 32.0.21030.2001 driver was installed and worked incredibly well regarding audio and image quality (video & overall). Audio quality, specifically, is still the best I've heard from any AMD driver to date.  I thought maybe the fresh install itself might have been the reason for the better audio quality, so I installed an adrenaline driver that I'm very familiar with, and was disappointed because the audio was noticeably worse.

Intel,"Nope. Generally if the driver does not massively increases performance in some game, or you don't have any issues or the issue you have isn't fixed, then it's not worth updating, unless there is some new feature you want.    I reverted back to 25.9.1 (from the top of my head) because with any newer driver BF6 crashes randomly, and neither DICE nor AMD seem to give a damn about it.    And before someone asks, I tried any other fix on the internet for Battlefield and nothing else worked.",Negative

Intel,"I’d wait on 5080ti with more VRAM but these are going to be obscenely expensive knowing nvidia + current RAM prices. Both 5070ti or 5080 are more of a sidegrade than upgrade, not worth the hassle IMO.",Negative

Intel,What about a secondhand 5070ti?,Neutral

Intel,Sidegrading for an upscaler sounds like a joke.,Negative
Intel,"I think Linux developers are doing some experiments As of now, FSR 4 (FidelityFX Super Resolution 4) does not officially support RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 GPUs, even on Linux. However, thanks to Develer’s work on VKD3D-Proton 3.0, there is partial and unofficial support for RDNA 3 under specific conditions.  RDNA 3: Partial Support via Develer’s VKD3D-Proton  - Develer’s VKD3D-Proton 3.0 includes support for FP8 (8-bit floating point), which is required for FSR 4. - This means RDNA 3 GPUs (like RX 7600, 7900 XT/XTX) can run FSR 4 in some games via Proton, even though AMD doesn’t officially enable it. - Global override toggles in AMD’s 25.9.1 driver can bypass the FSR 4 whitelist, allowing it to run in FSR 3.1-compatible games.  I hope they succed it will be a slap in the face.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah AMD refusing to port features to any card released before the 9 series makes supporting them really hard.,Negative
Intel,Say thanks they haven't demoted 7000 series to only game drivers,Neutral
Intel,"Your best case is your RX 7900 turning into Balsamico, whatever that means.",Positive

Now before I get kicked to death by angry people, there is a version of FSR Redstone that uses and INT8 path that is compatible and will work on 2 and 3, however that has not been launched today and AMD have not confirmed it will be.   That isn't to say they won't do it, but right now it's not been announced.

Core clock boosts itself WAY past what it is declared on the card(I got a Sapphire 9070XT Nitro, supposed to be 3060MHz). Here's the moment before it crashes to a black screen:  [afterburner screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/3YpJFtzM/Screenshot-2025-12-21-030537.png)  The dip in clocks is the moment it crashes. As you can see, it is running well above boost clocks. Hence, freezing in a few minutes, proceeded by a black screen, and a crash. The ups and downs are from me alt tabbing in the graphs, by  the way.   This is with core clock -200mhz applied in Afterburner and no crashes, boosts to just above declared boost clocks. Here the dips in up and down on power are probably me toying around how much exactly -mhz is needed.

I could propably reach out to a few more affected people over discord and encourage them to get active here, if you'd like.  But I do think that it is a fairly reproducable problem, at least on my end, it happened across two different systems.",Neutral
Intel,"Hi - I am having this problem. I wanted to try the special ROCM driver so dutifully did a clean install as suggested.  Tried to launch SteamVR and it errored. Realised headset had reverted to being a monitor, running at low resolution (less than recommended) Increased the resolution to recommended (combined resolution of the two panels), and SteamVR started detecting the headset - though promoted to enable direct mode. Pressing the button to enable it restarts SteamVR, but then prompts again, and HMD is still a monitor.   Interestingly reverting to the RDNA 4 release driver, it instantly worked - Direct Mode was enabled without me having to toggle.  So it is like SteamVR is successfully toggling something, but the newer AMD drivers ignore whatever it is doing/don't act on it. As soon as older driver is installed, it does act on it, and the HMD disappears from Display Settings/stops being treated as a monitor.  This wouldn't affect the majority of SteamVR users who are streaming to a Quest, and it wouldn't impact people who upgrade to a newer driver without a cleanup.  It would affect people doing fresh installs with a recent driver, and people who do clean driver installs/use DDU.",Neutral

I don't use any of the AMD audio outputs that populate the audio control panel, so I disable them. I don't use any software players; Roon, Jriver, etc. I just listen to music with Qobuz (Wasapi 16/44.1) and Spotify. Additional listening is done with Youtube and Twitch via Firefox. Just everyday simple stuff.  I hear you, the reason I haven't tried running WU again to maybe get that specific driver again is mainly because I don't want to update my system to a build that could potentially cause performance degradation or instability.

Intel,issue persists in the newest 26.1.1 update....,Neutral
Intel,OK thanks.,Positive
Intel,"First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to listen/read and look into this, I appreciate it greatly. I'm not sure why, but it seems your reply about the issue possibly being related to ISR isn't showing up on here for some reason. Could just be the site being dumb.  So, the audio differences I'm hearing aren't related to functionality, or the ability to playback audio without interrupts (dropouts, clicking, popping, choppiness). That has been flawless, for me, which is great. I'm referring to audio fidelity differences between drivers.  For instance, I uninstalled the driver I've recently been testing (25.12.1) via DDU and listened to some music with just the Microsoft display adapter being used as the driver. The audio sounded pretty normal again, and what I would consider correct/good. I then ran windows update, and it thankfully installed the 32.0.21030.2001 driver. Listened to some music, and as I heard before, it's still the best sounding driver I've used. The only other driver I've used that comes close is 25.1.1. That one has some slight issues with audio fidelity and image quality, but it was close enough to correct at the time.   The only thing I can think of that sounds similar and would describe what I'm hearing with these newer drivers is when you have a bit-depth and sampling rate mismatch between your music and output device. I have my audio devices set to 16/44.1 in windows, but with these newer drivers (25.9.1-25.12.1), the audio sounds as if the bit depth and sampling rate are set to higher values, even though they aren't. It's extremely strange, and sort of difficult to explain, but that's what I'm hearing.   The frustrating and unfortunate reality that might be coming into play here, is that differences could also vary between systems. So, a bad sounding driver on my system (25.9.1), might possibly sound fine or even good on a different system with different components.  It could also be caused by or related to interactions between code or the registry entries of different programs on the system interacting with drivers, but that's above my level of understanding. I'm just a dude who is noticing stuff (audio & video) and would like others who are smarter and more skilled to look into why there are differences in the first place and what could potentially be causing them.    By the way, you guys have been doing a great job with the video/image quality of these recent drivers. They are substantially better and closer to reference than everything previously released. 25.9.1 and 25.11.1 are the best drivers I've tested/used, in regards to video & image quality.",Neutral

Intel,7900 xt!  I did a DDU and installed the newest driver too so I feel like it isn't carried over unless it was something from my settings ...,Neutral
Intel,"Ah gotcha. To be fair, I would say the differences between these more recent drivers are much smaller now compared to the drivers released in 2023, 2024, and 2025. Especially trying each driver from 25.9.1 to 25.12.1, specifically the audio, seems to get better with each release. It seems the team, or someone, also heard what I did with the 25.9.1 driver and tried to fix/improve it with each subsequent driver release.   I haven't tried 26.1.1 yet, but I will to test and compare. I'll also install LatencyMon to see if there is a correlation between good/bad audio and latency.  It really seems like the team that handles the display/video side of the drivers has mostly corrected the issues that were present with the old drivers (video output format/range, luminance levels, gamma curve, sharpness, white point, grayscale & color accuracy). There are still differences, but I wouldn't get too worried about it.  The oddball out of the bunch is 25.8.1. The audio is actually pretty good, but different. Sounds as if there is a surround sound effect turned on, or the audio output format is surround sound instead of stereo. It works really well for gaming, but music sounds a little strange. Due to the overall frequency response balance, it's honestly not bad. If it wasn't for the video/image quality side of things, I would probably use that driver.   On the video side, I think there is something wrong with the gamma curve and color. The gamma curve tracks higher (darker) in the lower luminance range. The white point and grayscale are more blue than neutral gray, and the overall color saturation is reduced, as if the color gamut clamp in the adrenaline software is being used. I checked to see if this was the case with my colorimeter, but the color gamut is normal for my monitor, so the actual color volume isn't being reduced. Very strange, but interesting.",Positive

Intel,"Honestly, I plan to make sure my next display has Display Port in it. Mostly for linux though.",Positive
Intel,"There will already be branching inside the code of the driver. This has been the case already, to various degrees, for years. It's not new.  It's just whether AMD wants to formally spread those branches out on a file / compilation level and distribute different packages. And then publicly whether they commit to updating all branches of code or only some.  For any particular bug / feature / optimisation, there will be some cases where it's the same code path for practically all RDNA versions, you fix it once and it applies to everyone. For some, it might be very similar but not the same, just some slight tweaks and what gets fixed in RNDA3 can also be applied to RDNA2. For some, there's some hardware feature of RDNA3 that would make the fix easier there and it will be much more work to adapt the same to the RDNA2 branch. Of course, we have very little outside insight into the exact spread of these cases that AMD wants to pay their engineers to work on.",Neutral
Intel,There is a separate code path for specific things bit both are in those combine driver. Its mostly about certain ray tracing extensions   There are also fp8 and fp16 codepaths    People misunderstand and thought its like pre rdna stuff.,Neutral

I'd give this a quick read: https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-update-and-see-what-graphics-driver-you-have-on-linux-and-steamos/  Pretty much the default is that you will be using the Mesa driver collection and they were last updated yesterday.  The fixes there do not correlate with the ones in this thread (I think).  As long as you are on a ""cutting edge"" type distro then you can expect that update in the next few days/weeks.  If you are on a ""stable"" distro that doesn't update often, you may be waiting a realllly long time.",Neutral
Intel,"Get what exactly? Features? Bug fixes? Optimizations?   Every 2 weeks there are new Mesa driver updates with bug fixes and performance optimizations. As for features, you have to wait a few months for versions with big numbers (25.2 is soon updating to 25.3, adding Anti-lag 2).   Depending on your distribution, you can get these updates faster or slower.",Neutral

Sometimes I can play for hours on end, other time game just crashes randomly after 10-15 minutes.  I am going to try to downgrade to 25.9.1 and see how it fares, since I remember that driver being really stable for me (6800XT).  Edit: been playing for 4 hours, no crash yet.

Intel,"Weird. I was running 10.2 and things were running fine for the most part. I kept getting a pop-up on launch saying there was a known issue with that driver and Arc Raiders though, so I rolled it back to 9.2 and had more issues on that release than the one with the stated problems.

It idles, display sleep, 1 in 5 ish chance it locks up or bsods on wake.  Issue goes away using a non 4k 240hz display.     I believe this system crash is deeply related to DSC on Windows.  I only got these two PC bsods when I bought a 4k 240hz display.  Returned a monitor (bad oled) and the issue went away.  Got a new oled a few weeks ago and now I have these bsods again.     Never had a bsod before I got these 4k 240hz displays.  Fresh Windows 11 installs too between both PCs and between my first and second oled.  Systems are both solid and stable.     Linux works fine, but no HDMI 2.1 support thus no 240hz, which makes using the oled pointless imo.   While digging into my issue, I wanted to see if DP2.0 / uhbe20  compatible display would have these issues, but my current display only has HDMI2.1 and dp1.4.  Hopefully someone else had experience with them on 4k 240hz.",Negative

Intel,"Appreciate you reaching out with this - that's an interesting data point to consider.  In this case, the quirky behaviour with HDMI 2.1 + FRL was attributed to a change made in the display stack, I don't think it explicitly involves display stream compression to repro, just high enough display bandwidth (though I could be mistaken)",Positive
Intel,"Interesting. I've been experiencing random BSODs on my PC too on a fresh Win11 install too, I was also suspecting it was something to do with auto HDR toggle but I didn't know for sure.  I'm running 180hz 1440 LG panel but I don't recall if it's using hdmi or DP.

Intel,"It has nothing to do with the lack of vulkan support, even when fsr4 comes to vulkan, the game still needs ray regeneration implementation from the devs, you cant use optiscaler through dlss inputs, like you probably will be able to in fx alan wake 2",Negative
Intel,I suppose is going to be fixed as soon as Amd Redstone go out. Basically is going to add every tecnology that Path tracing needs to work. Off course the devs would have to implement them in the game too,Neutral
Intel,"The issue is if you try to use path tracing. Which to be fair, you probably shouldn't unless the miracle of them getting Virtuous to implement Ray Regeneration in Cyberpunk happens.",Negative

Intel,Hmm fair. For me on 9070XT if I had raytracing enabled it would crash most regularly on loading back to the menu after extraction which was annoying but at least not game destroying lol. But yeah annoying enough that I turned RT off entirely.   I hope this means I can turn it back on because the game runs well enough for it.,Negative
Intel,"Yes. So far, so good. I'm not 100% sure what fixed it.      I uninstalled both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master standalone applications. Deleted the ""amdryzenmasterv"" keys. Rebooted.  Then I installed Adrenalin and used the Ryzen Master installer in Adrenalin (Performance > Metrics > Install Ryzen Master).  I think this problem might have something to do with a handshake breaking between Ryzen Master and Adrenalin, after upgrading just Adrenalin.   From now on, I'll probably do clean installs, removing and reinstalling both Adrenalin and Ryzen Master, through Adrenalin Performance tab.",Neutral
Intel,"My last two processors are ryzen amd, my last three video cards are amd radeon and next one will be amd also, nvidia has driver issues as well, to be honest.  But yes, some issues are too annoying and updating drivers is lottery at this point. I would advice against updating drivers unless you need it for specific new game or have the latest video cards - rx 9070 \[xt\]  or 9060 xt .

Intel,Agreed the variability and stability of adapters can be quite hit and miss. Just wait it out unfortunately and don’t use the latest drivers. At least AMD owned up to it so I can’t be too upset but hopefully they really do fix this soon as new users may not understand what’s happening and think their card is bad.   We are already seeing this in other Reddit post from other users. I have been playing some damage control and telling them to downgrade and suddenly it’s stable for them and they don’t think their card is dead doh. So yeah AMD really needs to fix this soon.

Best way I can describe it is that very often the program fails to update its display information?? Most of the screen freezes to a certain frame and only small, sporadic parts of it - never the same ones, sometimes more, sometimes less - continue to be updated properly as I scroll or take other actions. Making the window smaller fixes this instantly. It seems to be tied to graphics acceleration as it just doesn't happen at all with it turned off. The issue seems to get exacerbated when the GPU is being stressed.   And in the same vein, Chromium browsers do not seem to mesh well with AMD hardware? I've had plenty of weird behaviors ranging from TDRs, WoW freezing in the background, crashing and restoring itself which do happen less often if I'm running Firefox in the background instead of Chrome.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind this only actually matters if one protocol or the other is **actually** limiting bandwidth for the [resolution * FPS] you want to display on your monitor  For instance, DP 1.4 can do ~25Gbits/s, which translates to roughly 1440p @ 240fps, or 4k @ 120fps  If you have proper cable into HDMI 2.1, it should be able to do ~42Gbits/s, which would instead be 4k @ 190fps  Read up the wikipedia tables for bandwidth specs and resolution / fps / bit depth rates for more",Neutral
Intel,Yeah most people are still have dp 1.4 monitors though. No way I'm swapping my monitor just for dp 2.1 as it's just too awesome. Although these tandem OLED screens look interesting... Hmm lol,Positive

Intel,That was my very first actual driver issue I experienced with AMD.,Negative
Intel,Oh that's nice! I'll look into it when I get the chance.,Positive
Intel,Cool. Thank you,Positive
Intel,I might turn on ray tracing in like a medium or low setting just for shits and giggles or screenshots but I don't plan on playing with it on all the time since I'll also play at 1440p so I don't wanna have a really bad experience 😖,Negative
Intel,Exactly! It's insane. I can't believe running through a translation layer is more stable than running native,Positive
Intel,"but i dont know something is also wrong with 25.11.1 ... AMD Adrenalin randomly vanishes from tray     i dont want to roll back to 25.9.1 :-(    but this version was the last which was good so far      maybe when we have luck amd is able to provide next time a ""perfect"" driver without any issues?",Negative
Intel,"Could be it, nothing hardware wise at all and just software too.     Yeah, you're not the 1st I've read that says they have issues on the game.     If you're crashing and the system reboots it does make me think of some stability issues and not really just GPU, but I'm guessing you've already tried stability tests and using the system without OC+A-XMP/EXPO disabled.     Once upon a time I remember reading some people, on other instances and other games, having crashes like that (complete reboot) due to PSU instability as well.     Good luck!",Neutral
Intel,That's strange. My game defaulted to everything maxed out including running ray tracing and I haven't noticed any issues. The game runs incredibly well.  I've got a 5800X3D & 9070XT as well.,Positive
Intel,"Fair enough, and yeah sooner the better for all of us",Positive
Intel,It absolutely could be.  Europe has some pretty good consumer law and promising features that could impact your purchase decision are part of this law.  It can fall under misleading advertisement,Neutral
Intel,"It's not freezing, it's just that the GPU usage is practically at 100% all the time, even with V-Sync enabled. With the 25.9 drivers, this doesn't happen, and the clock speed varies normally, increasing and decreasing as needed when V-Sync is enabled. These 25.10 drivers are causing the GPU to consume more energy unnecessarily.",Neutral
Intel,Fingers crossed,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks for attempting to retest.  It's a 7900XTX with an Index connected via DisplayPort. I am on the latest 25.11.1 driver.  I run a monitor at 4k 120Hz 10bpc with HDR Off, which uses DSC, as my main and only display. I tried disabling DSC in the monitor settings which runs at 4k 120Hz 8bpc with HDR Off but I don't think I noticed a change in latency. I thought that DSC on and off on two different devices might contribute to the problem but I'm not sure.   I have also tried running the Index under a RX480 on another PC and I fairly certain the latency looks different under 90Hz and looks similar under 120Hz. Can't play much to test though as an RX480 runs the Index at a very blurry setting. Getting around to doing this test is what took me so long to reply.",Neutral
Intel,Were you able to find the issue?,Neutral
Intel,"Allright ty, will Install new, any differences in performance?",Neutral
Intel,"im running 25.11.1 on win10 7900xt. no problems besides afmf2 breaking the performance overlay, which ive had for multiple updates now",Neutral
Intel,I don't think you understand what I mean.. If you downgrade to that you can get fsr 4 to work on 6000 series without having to change any files.,Neutral
Intel,Thank you for this. This was very helpful. Got adrenaline working fine now.,Positive
Intel,"I wish my LG C4 42"" had a display port. Its my primary monitor.",Positive
Intel,"Yep, AMD is not so quick in fixing their driver download page, I still can remember when X870E chipset came out but you found only X670 option. The drivers were the same, but man it’s your flagship chipset! Anyway, drivers install but Adrenalin App does not work for me… and have zero time to reinstall Windows.",Negative
Intel,"Don't do that, i'm suffering with both 7900XTX + RVII (and even with RX6400)",Negative
Intel,"I feel like AMD can do a bit of a better job communicating this, despite Vik's great efforts in this subreddit. Just saying: hey guys, we know about this, it sucks, bear with us please can make things better in the long run in my opinion.",Neutral

I'll talk to a colleague in our display team about what we can do to learn more about that behaviour on your side - we might ask you to capture a special kind of log file during a state when your secondary display is blanking with gameplay on the primary",Neutral
Intel,Can you tell us what content you have on the secondary panel when it starts misbehaving? Is this behaviour affected if you disable VRR on it too?,Neutral
Intel,"I see. I recall the partial display freeze being related to DWM & multi plane overlay in Windows. One of our community testers encountered this and remedied with the overlayminFPS DWORD here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1kgp7ar/cause_and_solution_to_windows_24h2_related/?sort=new  If you're getting TDRs, with chome(ium) + gameplay, pass us over a kernel memory dmp and we'll take a look into it",Neutral

Intel,"They are TV's, not pc monitors. Buy the right tool for the job",Neutral
Intel,"I couldn't find the DWM key so I made one, we'll see if that fixes it. Thank you for replying. But please, forward it to someone. There must be people out there on AMD hardware that are not tech savvy and this just breeds bad reputation.",Neutral
Intel,"Nope, that didn't fix it. Chrome continues to forget to update its display. And WoW continues to crash in the background leading to massive stutters when panning the camera around quickly, along with plenty of other odd behaviours.",Negative
Intel,"Yeah, I'm facing the same issue on RX 9060 XT   Is it a GPU driver issue, or a Windows issue that Microsoft needs to fix?",Negative
Intel,since last BF6 Update i had zero crashes also on 25.11.1,Negative
Intel,"That's not how it works. Small print won't save you from stuff like this, you think that they can stop releasing this software for 2-3 years because some small print said 'Subject to change'?   European consumer law would absolutely support the consumer in this case. If you promise a feature by a certain date, you will need to deliver it. If the development takes way too long, you are in for a ride",Negative
Intel,What about 25.11.1?,Neutral

Intel,"Not a typo, I was asking about something else and he missed my point...",Negative
Intel,"Yes, it can't.   They could add that they can sell your organs, doesn't make it legal though.   Also lawsuits usually don't happen because of a feature or if they happen, in a very small amount that isn't meaningful. Class action also doesn't exist in Europe, so obviously you won't hear about it like in the USA.",Negative
Intel,I used my Index on 25.12.1 just now and tried 90Hz mode again and the lag is still very noticeable. Tried it again at 120Hz and 90Hz on a RX480 and it doesn't have the issue.  I haven't tried 26.1.1 as it broke my DDC display remote software so I rolled back pretty quickly.  I don't have Smart Access Memory enabled. Could that be the problem?,Neutral
Intel,"But flipping the dlls could get you banned from online games , that's why i was wondering if it's finally fixed in this update and we wouldn't have to flip the dlls anymore..",Negative
Intel,"I doubt ReBAR (or the lack of it) could introduce an issue like that, specific to a display mode on your HMD. I'll follow up again to see if we can have another crack at reproducing this. I'm not sure why we're not observing this so far but you still are.  I'm wondering if capturing a specific type of display log whilst your headset is exhibiting the issue in the  90 Hz mode (and then another from the 120 Hz mode as a baseline) may help us understand what's happening - will follow up.",Negative

Intel,"Works in Windows too. But Windows has way too much overhead for all of the AI garbage, ads and integrated spyware running in the background to still be a usable operating system. Linux is much better.   The drivers install all side-by-side, and all GPUs show up as OpenCL devices. In the software you can then select which one to run on.   FluidX3D can select multiple OpenCL devices at once, each holding only one part of the simulation box in its VRAM. So VRAM of the GPUs is pooled together, with communication happening over PCIe.",Neutral

The rendering is done multi-GPU too, as domain decomposition rendering. Each GPU knows only a part of the whole fluid simulation box in VRAM and can't see the others. It only renders its own domain, at 3D offset, to its own frame with accompanying z-buffer, and copies those to CPU over PCIe. The CPU then overlays the frames.",Neutral

For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers.

Anyway, question for the more knowledgeable people: how could the 890M perform with a 50W chip variant, but with 5600 SO-DIMM RAM? What to expect?",Neutral
Intel,"I find it sad that most review outlet is not testing CCX latency for these new CPUs.  These Zen 5 + Zen 5c have insanely high cross CCX latency, 180ms tested by geekerwan to be exact. For reference the 5950x had a 70ms latency for their cross ccd latency and the 4 ccd 1950x had a 150ms cross ccd latency with the closet 2 ccd and 200ms between the furthest 2.

Intel,"We're a ways off from that still. These Strix Point 890M results are comparable to 1/2 the performance of the RX 6600. That's only good enough for \~30 FPS in Assassins Creed Mirage at 1080p Max.  I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select. And these consoles are pretty power constrained and pared down compared to PCs. So this APU here could easily double the performance of a console.   That's tapping on 4070/7800 levels of performance.",Neutral
Intel,Never gonna happen as long as they use DDR memory.  The only powerful APUs are those that use GDDR or HBM. See: every AMD-powered console and the MI300A.,Negative
Intel,"Radeon iGPUs are mostly limited by the shared RAM bandwidth. I was thinking of getting an 8700G a little while ago, and the benchmarks varied wildly depending on RAM frequency and overclocks.  Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem. A budget RTX 4070m/7800m will crush an M2 Max in pure GPU grunt.",Negative

If Intel can be competitive in the budget market it will at least put a fire under amd to lower their prices/make a better valued product.",Negative
Intel,That would be fine if no one else had ever invented a GPU until Intel did.   The fact is there's lots of architectural precedent for Intel to have learned from that they just...didn't.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Somebody else even made a huge post here and on r/linux, phoronix covered it slightly and AMD went into full panic mode, their developer advocate came here and on AMD forums and in emails and made many grand promises. Here we are almost 10 years later, same issues still exist.  Oh yeah, and BlackMagic (DaVinci Resolve maker) today officially doesn't support their software on any AMD hardware.

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.  You're free to guess what vendor om looking at to replace my CPU with. Damn shame really.",Negative

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.   I guess it really depends on if things are improved when it comes time to buy a new GPU, but we’ll have to wait and see.",Neutral

Also some other games having driver timeouts to, but i have games that also never timeout.

I highly recommend AMD to have public bug tracker for reporting issues also games, allow users filter on games to see all the user reports for that game, have it all consolidated into same issue if its the same issue, allow users only to upvote remove down vote, i do not have any issues does not contribute to fixing problems it encourages ignorance nothing personal against anyone not having issues, i often have no issues to but they are not proof of stable drivers, they are just one user experience not everyone user experience, everyone is allowed to speak for them self, AMD does not require any defending, the only time its appropriate is when AMD is treated unfairly missing from benchmark charts unfairly.  Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical. I guess that's why nobody is already doing it.",Neutral

All in one GUI that makes it easy. In theory, it is a good attempt.  Note I said attempt...

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?  And when you want to factually discuss it to have maybe a fix, a workaround, a solution, some software written by someone like you that actually fixes things, something, what do you get?

My only fix for this with two monitors is:  1. alternate monitor must me locked at 60hz 2. main monitor needs a custom hz rating, set within ""Custom Resolution"" in AMD Adrenalin.  Basically I set a ""custom resolution"" in 1hz increments from 160-170hz (top 10 hz rating that your monitor is capable of) until I found the highest refresh rate that would give me low idle power.  I found that 162 hz was the highest my main monitor could go with my 2nd monitor sitting at 60hz. If I went with 163hz on the main my idle power goes from 7w to 40w.  That being said, this is typical AMD BS that you have to deal with as an owner of their GPUs. There are countless other examples that users have to do similar to this to get a mostly good experience.",Negative
Intel,"Excellent post, very informative. Would take issue with this though:       ""Speaking of VRAM, The drivers use VRAM less efficiently. Look at any side-by-side comparison between games on YouTube between AMD and NVIDIA and you'll often see more VRAM being used on the AMD cards""   Saw a side-by-side video about stuttering in 8gb cards (can find it if you want), the nvidia card was reporting just over 7gb vram used yet hitching really badly. The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report? The monitoring apps are reading values from somewhere, but how are those values arrived at? What calculations generate that harvested value to begin with?    My own sense is that there's a pretty substantial question mark over the accuracy of these figures.",Neutral

Intel,"SR-IOV and MxGPU is edge case. There are far more vGPU deployments powered by NVIDIA and that horrible licensing then there is anything else. AMD is just not a player there. That's the bottom line of the issue here. And VFIO plays heavily in this space, just instead of GPU partitioning its the whole damn GPU shoved into a VM.  So the Instinct GPUs that AMD are selling is being used on metal by large compute arrays, and not for VDI, remote gaming sessions, or consumer space VFIO. This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".  I brought this issue up to AMD a few years ago and they didnt see any reason to deliver a fix, their market share in this space (MxGPU/vGPU, VFIO, Virtualized GPUs) has not moved at all either. So we can't expect them to do anything and spend the man hours to deliver fixes and work with the different projects (QEMU, Redhat, Spice, ...etc).",Negative

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Intel,"> That's more of a CPU/platform issue than a GPU issue.  It happened to me 0 times with an Nvidia card while OCing for hundreds of bios cycles and thousands of hours on AM4/AM5, while Radeon users are experiencing it all of the time. The CPU/platform is fine.  The Radeon graphics drivers hooking into CPU OC and platform controls intimately - or even at all - for no good reason are not fine.",Negative

Intel,"I get that you are being cheeky, but the use-case is very difference and the professional-demands are far far far higher.  When you run several machines off of a single unit, suddenly there's workloads that has to be completely in due time for things to move ahead.  I just want to contextualize the issue you are making (a tadd) fun of.  So in the basic but common example above, you can't really complete your job because the entire main system has to be shut down. That's like stranding 6 people because the bus broke down. And now all 6 people have to walk. Instead of let's say a gamer: He take his super expensive OR cheap car 10 minutes down the street instead. To and from work, the store. His car 100% for sure will break down, but it's happening so rarely a normal check gets the fault before it's found. OR, he only miss a few hours once a few years if his car break down.  I think it's a decent comparison of the issue here, to use PC hardware in multiple instances, but being forced to restart a system in un-manageable. There need to be a proper high-grade (and low grade) reliable way to avoid that.  Just sucks it took this long, and so much effort to get AMD to pay notice to the issue at hand here.

So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less. In Vulkan - DXVK have huge overhead about 1Gb on Nvidia GPUs in many cases, and Unity ""eat all vram possible"" behavior explode difference.",Neutral

Intel,"Let me tell you some stuff regarding how a GPU works.   Raster performance can only take you so far.   We are in the brink of not being able to add more transistors to the GPU.   Yield rates are incredibly low for high end parts, so you need to improve the space usage for the GPU DIE.   Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.   Im damn sure (and I did this before with people at my home) that if I provide you with a game blind testing it with DLSS and Frame Gen, along with other games with those features on and off, you wont be able to notice at all.",Negative

The whole issue here is that your memory bus with 3 monitors active is NOT idle... if you want it to idle down turn your dang monitors off, its that easy.

Until I made my prior posts here on r/AMD, AMD were not interested or even awake when it came to these issues. I have had direct correspondence with John Bridgman where he confirmed that GPU reset was not even considered in prior generations.  Of what use are these support contracts and the high cost of buying these cards if AMD wont provide the resources to make them function in a reliable manner.

Intel,"Part of it is rooting for the underdog, part of it is probably due to people legitimately not having problems.

Intel,"Good ol' ""it works on my machine"".  It's a small and niche userbase so it gets downplayed, backed by ""it works on my machine"" when you express your concerns, despite the fact they don't use that feature or have zero knowledge on the topic. Same goes to H.264 hardware encoder being worst of the bunch for years.  And the average joe just doesn't use Linux, if they do, then few of of them actually toy around virtualization, then even fewer of them poke around hypervisors with device passthrough(instead of using emulated devices, which has poor performance and compatibility). It really is the most niche of the niche circle. I'm not looking down on users or playing gatekeeping/elitism but that's just a hard pill to swallow.  But that doesn't mean AMD should be ghosting the issues as people have been expressing their concerns even on datacenter systems where real money flows.  How many r/Ayymd trolls actually know VDI, VFIO and let alone what ""reset"" means? Probably has never google'd them, despite the fact one of the most well-respected FOSS wizards in this scene is trying to communicate with them. I hope gnif2 doesn't get upset from the trolls alone and wish him a good luck on Vanguard program.

Intel,"Firstly, i am barely even able to find any posts about this issue. Which means that issue is extremely case specific, so you should not categorically blame AMD and Adrenaline. With how many people this happen with, it is not problem of Adrenalin itself (otherwise it would've been reported A LOT more than i can find).   They may have some weird system conflict, or some weird BIOS setup from manufacturer. But Adrenalin installation doesn't OC your CPU just at fact of installation.  For context, if i still would've had my 5600X (now i have 5800X3D, and Adrenalin doesn't see it as CPU it can work with, as it doesn't provide CO option iirc), and had it OC'ed through BIOS, Adrenalin would've seen it as OC'ed. It doesn't mean that Adrenalin OC'ed CPU, but rather that SOMETHING did that.  I also saw reports that after deleting Adrenalin, resetting BIOS to defaults and installing same exact Adrenalin version back, they stopped having OC on their CPU.     From global issues with CPU OC was only one i mentioned. When AMD integrated Ryzen Master, old GPU OC presets did reset CPU OC values to default. To fix that you just needed re-set GPU OC and resave preset after update.",Negative

I have two devices with the last gen chips, the 258v and 256v. Basically identical beside the RAM. I actually use the 256v system as a ""work daily"" cus of low energy usage. Anyway, these new chips certainly suck more power if they need it and are set to performance mode but that also comes with a lot more performance.   Performance mode does kick the fans up, which would help with dissipating heat. This mode seems to be around 40w max. The balanced mode is about a 30w max and the eco-silent looks to be sub 20w.

The full wattage 4050 (100w+) is about as fast as a 3060 desktop, this tiny iGPU in real world gaming tests will be at most best case scenario as fast as a full powered 3050, which is still  a massive 50-60% slower than a 4050 laptop.",Negative

It's not trading blows with the 5050 65W. It's getting creamed by the 4050 60W.

Intel,"lol. Six months late and $300 (60%) over the announced price.  If the dual GPU version was really available for $999 right now (as announced), then Intel would make significant inroads into the local AI market.  As it is, buying this for $800 over a used 3090 is a really hard sell. Compared to a B60, the 3090 is readily available for $1100, and provides the same VRAM, double the compute and memory bandwidth, better perf/watt, and CUDA support.  With the dual GPU cards even at $2k each this does have one single niche - being able to get 144 GB of VRAM in a server at under 1500W for under $10k -  which is legitimately useful for LLM inference.

Intel,"What do you mean? They were a proper data bus, iirc.",Neutral
Intel,"i'm no expert but i dove in to Wiki      it was a [1GB/s to 3.25GB/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Link_Interface) interface. For refference PCI-E 2.0 was 1GB/s and 3.0 was 2GB/s BUT per lane so 16 and 32GB/s.  For refference HDMI 1.4 has 10.2Gbit/s  So as i understood it most of the data bandwidth were used for tossing the image output back and forth as only a single card were the one outputting the image (assuming you weren't running tripple monitor widescreen setup on SLI GPU's....) and our image data could more or less saturate the link  someone correct my math if i'm totally bonkers, but 2560x1440p = 3.686 million pixels. each using 24 bit (8-bit color on 3 chanels) which is 88Mbit/s. if you output 60 of those that is 5.3Gbit/s. 1GB/s = 8Gbit/s. Okay okay you wouldn't always throw a full image so lets call it 2.5Gbit. You were still using quite a lot of the bandwidth on the image alone, so from my understanding most of the interface communication was more related to ""who did what"".  and in AFR you would be handing over a full frame.",Neutral
Intel,"It was used purely to transfer rendered images, correct.",Neutral
Intel,"phew! my understanding was correct! And this is why the new nvlink is different. It's not just image data transfere. But also a LOT faster.

One is numbered as unidirectional and the other bidirectional, so half the numbers above. But that is still VERY fast, even if it's a bit slower than the memory bus speed.",Neutral

I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

Intel,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage.

And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations.

Intel,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die.

Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

Valve definitely wants a wider adoption rate of SteamOS and ditching x86 is not going to help that. They are **not** Nintendo that can ask devs to target their architecture. It's going well so far because for most games you can just make a standard Windows version, slap Proton and it works within 10% of native performance under optimal circumstances.

Intel loses node leadership to TSMC for a long time, Apple moves on to everything in-house is a pretty logical progression.  Apple having bespoke solutions isn't new either. they've been doing it since their G workstation days. Their current situation is pretty much on brand for apple, but the difference is the huge mistakes intel made (particularly firing so many top engineers) that led to staff fleeing to other companies, including leadership at Apple processor design.  basically apple did their own thing as usual and did a great job don't get me wrong, not taking anything away from apple. the biggest difference however was intel's CEO and board destroying the company.",Neutral

That said, I’m pretty skeptical about how realistic that is. **With the recent RAM shortages and rising memory costs**, pricing a new card competitively while still keeping margins doesn’t sound easy at all. Memory is a huge part of the BOM, and we’ve already seen how shortages can push prices up across the board.

Intel,"u/Phaldaz, upon checking, the graphics update for the Intel® Graphics for Intel® Core™ processors (Series 2) will contain the following:  \- Driver improvements for Arc iGPU (graphics performance, game compatibility)   \- NPU software stack updates (AI acceleration libraries, framework support)   \- General software optimizations that aren't hardware-dependent  However, you would need to consider that the following will not be included on the driver update:  \- Hardware-level architectural improvements (new instruction sets, hardware security features)   \- Significant performance gains that rely on new silicon design   \- Power efficiency improvements tied to manufacturing process changes  If you're primarily looking for good performance now and aren't concerned about having the absolute latest features, a Series 2 laptop could be a smart buy. You'll get most software improvements, and the money saved could offset any performance differences.  However, if you're planning to keep the laptop for 4+ years or need cutting-edge AI performance, waiting might be worth it despite the RAM pricing issues.",Neutral

AMD,"Absolutely bullshit if true. This is not an old chip, and is still being sold in several products. I really hope this is some sort of miscommunication, because this a REALLY bad look if they hope to keep being competitive in the handheld PC space. Hell, they're basically still selling this chip in a shittier variant as the Z2A, a ""new"" product.   Shame because the Z1E is an excellent chip with surprisingly good gaming performance for an APU. They're not a small company with limited resources, and it is not unreasonable to demand proper support. Oh well, at the very least the drivers for my ROG Ally are fairly mature, so not a big loss,",Negative
AMD,"AMD dropping support for something follows right behind the certainty of death and taxes. As a productivity use-case monkey it ended any question of Team Red being an option, ever.  ROCM stack users, all couple dozen of them, probably like to play a little game where they order a card and take a bet on if it gets delivered before support is axed.  I jest, but really last I had a peek average support lifetime was ~2-3 years. It's a testament to their marketing departments prowess that somehow they've cultivated an image on Reddit of being being the consumer focused brand. The scrappy little underdog fighting for the common man.  Only to get the ""Well, what have you done for me lately?"" treatment in two years time when they drop support for your hardware.  Causes a tickle in the medulla when you see NVIDIA still supporting cards that have long past the point of being considered e-waste.",Negative

AMD,"this is why people should resist when Z1 was released. I had my share of experience on Raven Ridge 2500U and the protest lead to monthly reference driver for Ryzen Mobile that people take for granted today. Funny enough during that time we even cross install desktop APU driver for 2400G just to see if it plays well with our 2500U laptop.

AMD,This was based off 1 report of someone allegedly asking someone who doesn't even know or work for AMD at Lenovo customer support. I would take this with a huge pinch of salt since 1) it is based on the 780m chips which are still being supported. 2) it was a south korean representative from Lenovo who stated this and there is no proof. 3) AMD have not officially said anything on the subject. 4) the chip isn't even that old so i highly doubt they will stop support this early on. If there is any truth about it it is more likely a disagreement between Lenovo and AMD if anything and Lenovo aren't the best at keeping their products updated anyway so this could be some underhanded excuse as to why there will be little to no support for the LeGo 1.,Negative
AMD,This is why amd will always be 2nd fiddle in GPU's with terrible support for their products,Negative
AMD,Is this story confirmed? doent feel believable to me. why did AMD make a seporate driver for z1e thats different than 7840u/780m.  Im under the impression that the Legion Go 1(z1e) used standard AMD drivers. no?,Negative
AMD,"Clickbaity as most other sources would specify the SKU (Legion Go Gen 1) affected in title, although in general OEMs are slow to push driver updates (Ally / LeGo S)  LeGo S’ drivers work on LeGo for the time being.

AMD,"As a little example, here are the acknowledged Known Issues for the current Ryzen desktop onboard graphics -  * Intermittent application crash or driver timeout may be observed while loading a saved game in Cyberpunk 2077 with Path Tracing enabled. AMD is actively working on a resolution with the developer to be released as soon as possible. * Intermittent application crash or driver timeout may be observed while playing Battlefield™ 6 on AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. AMD is actively working on a resolution with the developer to be released as soon as possible. * Intermittent application crash or driver timeout may be observed while playing Roblox Player (Car Zone Racing & Drifting) when task switching between media on Radeon™ RX 7000 series products.  * Texture flickering or corruption may appear while playing Battlefield™ 6 with AMD Record and Stream on some AMD Graphics Products.  So, without updates, these issues just aren't getting fixed. There will likely be a tonne more that AMD haven't publicly acknowledged, or yet been made aware of.  On top of that, the latest drivers give  **New Game Support**  * Starsand Island * Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora™ - From the Ashes Edition  **Fixed issues**  * Some shadows may not render correctly while playing Call of Duty®: Black Ops 7 on some AMD Graphics Products on Radeon™ RX 5000 series and Radeon™ RX 6000 series graphics products. * Texture corruption may be observed when playing Enshrouded while at the first “Elixir Well” location on Radeon™ RX 7000 series and Radeon™ RX 9000 series graphics products. * Application may fail to launch while playing Diablo 4 with usernames containing non-english characters on Radeon™ RX 7000 series and Radeon™ RX 9000 series graphics products. * Some lights may not render correctly while playing Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 during nighttime scenes on Radeon™ RX 9000 series graphics products. * Application crashes when using Unreal Engine 5.6 Editor with Lumen HWRT enabled on Radeon™ RX 5000, Radeon™ RX 6000, Radeon™ RX 7000 and Radeon™ RX 9000 series products. *  Intermittent visual corruption may be observed while navigating Chromium and Electron apps on Radeon™ RX 5000 series and Radeon™ RX 6000 series graphics products. * Slow window resizing may be observed (related to vkAcquireNextImage extension) while developing games that use the Vulkan API on Radeon™ RX 7000 series and Radeon™ RX 9000 graphics products. * Intermittent audio dropouts during minimized video playback on certain Xiaomi and Hisense TV models on AMD Radeon™ RX 9000 series graphics products. * Player sprites may not render correctly while playing Cassette Beasts on Radeon™ RX 7000 series and Radeon™ RX 9000 series graphics products. * Artifact may appear when playing Baldur’s Gate 3 with TAA enabled on Radeon™ RX 5000 series and Radeon™ RX 6000 series graphics products.

AMD,"Aye, exactly! It blew my mind the Xonar community was developing their own drivers because ASUS couldn't be bothered to support their own products. Major props to everyone that contributed their time to those open source drivers!  ASUS was still releasing new models of Xonar hardware for more than a decade after the originals, even as they let the drivers stagnate. Something around 30 Xonar products they couldn't be bothered to driver support. Win 10 launched and it took nearly six more months before a beta driver belatedly showed up, then more than a year before a non-beta driver was released and that was the last update for my card. Even so there were some showstopper bugs in the only drivers ASUS released so those open unified drivers proved to be a lifesaver.  Given my other experiences with ASUS being reluctant to dedicate software support to its products I'd be far more inclined to suspect the fault is with ASUS on the delayed/lack of Z1 driver updates. I could be entirely wrong and it's an AMD problem, but ASUS hasn't done itself any favors and this behavior is already one of the reasons why I don't buy ASUS products anymore.",Positive

AMD,This js a confusing situation for me because there are drivers for the other pheonix apus. My 7840hs had its last driver update in January and its the same chip but clocked differently,Neutral
AMD,"when i said better, i was mostly thinking about architecture wise. so cpu and graphics architecture.  strix halo (eg ryzen ai+ 9 395) is architecturally basically the same as well. it has zen5 cpu chiplets, which are performance wise about the same as zen4 cores/chiplets. (again only x3d saw real meaningful uplifts due to massive clock boosts for x3d)  and graphics wise strix halo is still just rdna 3 ("".5"")  it is the same graphics architecture as the ryzen z1 extreme. the difference is, that strix halo is just a LOT wider and bigger right.  like a 9060xt vs a 9070 xt. same architecture, but one is vastly bigger and has a bigger memory bandwidth to feed it as well.  also strix halo got delayed a bunch, which may make it seem like it is sth newer, when it isn't.  no longer releasing drivers for the ryzen z1 extreme, but still releasing drivers for strix halo (eg ryzen ai+ 9 395) is like releasing drivers for the 9070 xt still, but refusing to release more drivers for the 9060 xt 16 GB, just because you feel like it.  it is just utterly absurd.  it is the same freaking graphics architecture exactly. so like how long will they feel like supporting strix halo? give it another year and then bye bye drivers, despite them still selling it and it being their fastest chip or some insanity?  it is just completely and utterly absurd to cut support for not just VERY YOUNG hardware, but hardware, that runs the same architectures as your current best and latest released stuff in mobile/handheld as well.  just crazy.",Neutral
AMD,High on Life 2 asks for new drivers and refuses to run on the Z1E as we speak according to user comments.,Neutral

AMD,"A few weeks ago I read a comment that AMD on their showcase will try to sell you the features that they will add in the future, but the moment a new shiny toy is released they abaddon their previous GPUs almost instantly...  And the fact that they did this with RDNA3 & now this just tells me that I should never even look at AMD outside of X3D series.  The fact that 2000 series just got DLSS 4.5 that looks *exactly* the same like on 5000 series just with a bigger performance drop is absolutely crazy.

AMD,or they just won't work. A lot of games force you to update drivers now days for what ever reason.  My guess though is they got tired of Why doesn't my game run right support questions. The person running a 2 or 3 year old driver.   While don't think you need to update monthly (cause feels like Nvidia releases monthly drivers). It doesn't hurt to update your driver every 3-4 months or so. To keep things working or if a game demands it of course.,Negative

The issue here is that *I* as a customer will look on the track record of the both corporations, and compare how long they support their GPUs either with Drivers, or Features, which AMD is absolutely lacking, and in the last 6 months alone convinced me to never look at AMD seriously at all.  Last year I played a few Triple-A games on my RX 6600 (it was a temporary replacement after my GTX 1080 died), and FF7 Rebirth & The Last of Us Part 2 were both having driver issues *for months*, and this exact GPU was part of the ""misclick"" when they announced that they're dropping the driver support.

AMD,"The TUF A14 is no more of a creation oriented machine than the G14 is. Although yeah, you’re right. Replacing a 5060 with Strix Halo is much easier than replacing a 5080.

AMD,200 watts?  Because a strix halo system going full bore pulls 80-120 watts.,Neutral
AMD,I guess that was just a test bench. The G14 chassis is well overkill for Panther Lake. Asus managed to cool it easily in a 1.1kg Expertbook Ultra and the ZenBook S series will manage it fine as well,Neutral

AMD,The Tuf A14 also decidedly is limited to 32GB and no 16 core cpu. They specifically used the 8 core and 12 core cpu paired with 8060S.

AMD,"Client and gaming were 40% of AMD's revenue in the last quarter where their DC demand was already well into its unprecedented boom (that will not last even if there is no bubble burst, as the world can't sustain this rate of DC build-up forever). That number already reflects a period when they were prioritizing DC sales as much as they could at peak demand. And even under those conditions, they still needed to sell most dies to client where they got the 40% of their revenue from that wouldn't exist without gaming.  So DC is where margins are, with cyclical and highly unpredictable demand patterns, and usually limited volumes. Client is where the volumes of the products they make actually reliably sell. Most Zen and RDNA dies will end in consumer products simply because there isnt enough lasting demand from business to buy them at their higher margins.  Importantly, gaming makes them tens of billions of dollars a year, is a revenue stream and demand channel that's consistent and growing over decades.   We like to make ourselves feel so irrelevant, but there would be no AMD without client even WITH the unprecedented AI/DC boom we're witnessing.  If even as much as a correction happened affecting the DC demand, client/gaming sentiments are what drives whether AMD stays in business.",Neutral

AMD,"Its leverage, welcome to the business world.",Neutral
AMD,The MI455x looks to be very competitive but there is a larger barrier in software. It's getting a foot through the door and then on the next order Nvidia can't flash the software stack.

AMD,"The 5800X3D came out in April 2022. From that moment on, the gamer and enthusiast answer to ""what CPU should I buy?"" has been a Ryzen. But even outside of the enthusiast space, Intel's competition for the last couple generations has been underwhelming. The 13th and 14th gen used way too much power, before the stability problems began, and Core Ultra is ""ok"" but didn't raise the bar.  This has allowed AMD to charge higher prices than they've been able to for a long time, increasing revenue which is what this article is really about.  Intel's Panther Lake seems to be... good? At the very least its integrated graphics are good. The desktop version is rumored to have a high cache option to finally compete with the X3D.

AMD,I went back to AMD last year after at least a decade using Intel. I’ve been very happy with my Ryzen 7.,Positive
AMD,"Outside of performance, the Longevity of their platforms is part of the reason people choose AMD. in just 2 sockets, which will turn 10 years total next year, AMD delivered 6 gens so far (1000,2000,3000,5000,7000,9000) and might be 7 with 10000 series ending AM5  Since 2017, Intel delivered more Gens (10 so far), but on far more sockets (From LGA 1151 to now LGA 1954) - basically a new socket every two years.  2022 to 2026 Intel has 3 sockets with 5 gens. AMD has 1 socket with 2 gens and 3rd incoming. So you could have brought a motherboard in 2022 (B650) and still enjoy the latest gen from AMD). If you brought 2022 Intel socket, to enjoy latest, you need either LGA 1851 (Ultra 2) or wait for Ultra 4 (LGA 1954).

AMD,"This is a weird title, it could also be written a dozen other ways.  Intel's fall from grace has a lot to do with it.  I've been building PCs since the 386 days.  I've owned Intel, AMD, Cyrix, IBM chips, basically all consumer chips.  I moved away from AMD after the early Pentium days and haven't gone back.  I've also deployed both AMD and Intel in close to a thousand servers, 10s of thousands if we count VMs.  I'm now about to upgrade to an AMD processor for the first time in about 25 years, for my personal PC.  To me, Intel's failing is the main reason for AMDs surge.  Nothing happens in a vacuum though, so you could argue that AMD being better is the story, rather than Intel being worse, but both are true.",Neutral
AMD,"Makes a lot of sense, almost every custom pc i encounter nowadays as well as prebuilt comes with Ryzen nowadays, you'd think too that they own majority of marketshare, but that isn't the case as there are plenty of laptops old PCs out there that still rocks older gen of Intel CPUs from 12th gen or under.  That said though this means bad for newer gen of Intel CPUs, the newer ones with rebranding that i can't even remember to type here, that is how forgettable they are, were so bad... That when i looked for upgrading from my 12600K, i came from AMD Ryzen before that, i simply decided to go back to AMD AM4 this time around where i used my old B450 motherboard and slotted a 5700X3D there and rode on that for at least a year, then eventually upgraded to AM5 when DDR5 Ram and motherboard prices were dirt cheap and now i am on a 7800X3D.  For me to be enticed once again to comeback to Intel, they need to offer an equivalent to 3D-V Cache for gaming performance while featuring significantly multi core workload performance than what Ryzen currently offers, that is what convinced me when i jumped from my previous Ryzen 5 3600 to an i5 12600K which was noticeably faster while giving me significantly more multicore performance compared to if i would have just upgraded to then $300 5600X which i felt is too expensive for what it offered back on launch.",Neutral

I believe they've got the 3 best gaming CPUs on the planet right now (98/78/99 X3D) and they're sipping power compared to Intel for that. Plus, with the 7800X3D dropping to mid 300s for a fairly long time now you've got pretty much the best overall gaming processor on the market. As for the 9950X3D. Nobody is buying that for simple gaming outside of people with more money than sense. It's a workstation CPU that can game. It's meant to be a premium product like the 9900K was.

AMD,"245kf is a decent CPU and so is the 14600k. They are about equal to a little bit better than a 7600X or 9600X in gaming. The problem is that Intel chipsets comparable to B650 or B850 are extremely, outrageously expensive and provide no upgrade path. Hence it makes more sense to go AM5 if you like DIY. I don't care if you don't actually overclock or upgrade the CPU. Intel non-OC chipsets are still more expensive than AMD OC chipsets and buyers clearly like having the option of OC/dropping in a new CPU even if they never actually do it.  This may change with Nova Lake/LGA 1951, since Zx70 boards are coming back and the socket will allegedly support four generations of CPUs.

AMD,"Steve raises a good point, after building my own desktops for 23 years (and ironically all of those being on Intel platforms) I am having a super hard time envisioning Intel managing to stick to a single socket for just four years, certainly forgot about 6-8. Intel doesn't have the clout or the performance lead to get away with two year, even two generation sockets anymore. And I say that even despite Intel's new modular chip approach, which would allow Intel to maintain socket compatibility more easily than it could with monolithic chips. Intel has yet to commit to even a mid-length socket plan.   On the flipside, given the bulk of the volume of Intel's chips are sold through OEMs how much does the DIY segment ultimately matter? OEMs have to buy all the various parts anyway so what does it matter if the platform changes yearly. And it has even less bearing on servers. Seems like another decade of this could see Intel as the small player in the DIY space yet still remain the vast majority of OEM offerings.  My previous desktop was Haswell, the last DDR3 generation. Quite literally between the 4th gen and 9th gen there just wasn't a point to upgrade. I started getting antsy by 10th gen, but the 11th gen disaster that was Rocket Lake nixed buying into another dead socket platform. So after seeing how stable and long-term AM4 support had been, combined with the incredible 5800X3D capstone for the socket I was sold on investing into AM5. Sure DDR5 was pricey at launch but I'd already skipped the DDR4 generation entirely. And since X3D chips mitigate the effects of slower memory one can continue to use the same memory across the life of the system without having to replace it which more than makes up for the early upfront cost. Picking up a drop-in CPU upgrade in 4-6 years meant that for the early adopters one AM5 system can effectively last a full decade without compromise, for only the cost of a second CPU.  The third angle is that all the AM5 early adopters are now sitting in the catbird seat, even in spite of the AI shitfest dragging everything down into a cesspool of misery they can pick up a Zen 6 X3D chip for a drop in upgrade and remain entirely unaffected. Clearly the expectation we've all held about how things will remain normal and that hardware will always be getting cheaper (sans GPUs) probably needs to be reassessed. Sure prices will probably return to normal (or even crash given all the fab capacity being built today that will be online by 2030), but by building a system you won't have to replace means builders won't be exposed to begin with when the next crazy thing comes along. We've already had two crypto bubbles, covid supply disruptions, two separate trade tariff wars, and now we have AI induced mass inflation. All in the span of **one** decade. I think way more people are going to eventually recognize just how good having platform longevity is, particularly when it comes without compromises.",Neutral
AMD,"Great video, these revisions/retrospectives are some of my favourite HUB content. In spite of being very relevant, so few outlets do them - and nobody seems to do them as well.  AMD made huge gains within AM4 for sure, with the fantastic X3D CPUs to finish with a dominant gaming platform. What this video doesn't even highlight, is that when I bought a brand new system in mid 2021 (before the release of Alder Lake), AM4 was still straight up the best value for an all new gaming platform, and I bought it without any reasonable expectation of upgrading.  I feel Steve kind of glosses over AM5's expected upgrade path towards the end, where he does rightfully mentions that an in platform upgrade path mostly makes sense if you start on the lower end. Even now (or at least before RAM prices blew up) getting a 7500/7600X the upgrade path was a huge consideration as the 11800X3D (or whatever the name will be) should be a huge in platform gain (though nothing like a 1700X to 5800X3D). If you get in on AM5 now with a 9800X3D, I don't think the remaining platform longevity will ever provide a significant in socket upgrade.  Lastly, Steve mentions his surprise at the high end 7800X3D and 9800X3D being 2 of the top 3 best selling CPUs on amazon. While I do think the hype and FOMO are a part of it, with the increasingly high GPU prices we've gotten used to, and especially alongside obscene RAM and NVME prices we've had as of late, the added cost to the total system for going to an X3D CPU just isn't that big a part of overall system cost anymore. If you spend $800 on a GPU and $350 on 32GB of RAM and $250 for 2 tb of storage, how much is that $200 extra for the best gaming CPU money can buy? Purely speculative, but that's my take.  Either way I'm looking forward to what zen 6 will bring. The rumoured new IO die should be at least interesting to see if they can squeeze more performance out of this socket, though still not expecting anywhere near the gen-on-gen improvements they managed to make on AM4.",Positive
AMD,"am4 was good because cpus were discounted very quickly in 2nd market. Motherboards used to be ""cheap"" as well.  I had 2600x with 1070 then upgraded to 6700xt then 5070ti still using 5700x because it does the job.",Positive
AMD,"Even for DIY builders I would argue that it is a clear minority that upgrade their CPU's more regularily than every 4-6 years. I of course don't have any data to back that up, but anecdotal evidence plus the fact that CPU bottlenecks take longer that a generational gap to truly become relevant I think kind of backs that up.  Assuming you upgrade every 5 years, is swapping out a motherboard really that big of a deal, both in terms of cost and time spent? I honestly don't see a world in which it is.  Taking price into consideration, the logic kind of undercuts itself. If you’re upgrading every 1-2 years, you’re likely not that budget-constrained to begin with, but an upgradable platform indeed makes sense in that case. If you are budget-conscious, the rational move is to hold onto your as-is system for longer, and at that point, a full platform upgrade often makes sense anyway because you’re getting meaningful improvements beyond just the CPU.  So platform upgradability sounds great on paper, but in practice it only meaningfully benefits a narrow group of mid-cycle upgraders. For most buyers, total platform cost over time isn’t materially different, and the flexibility advantage is smaller than it’s often made out to be.",Neutral
AMD,"Most people buy a new cpu every 5 or 6 years.  Yeah, it's annoying to occasionally need to buy a new mobo, but it's not the end of the world.",Negative
AMD,Motherboard oems actually like to carry the same parts and materials for long lasting am4. This helps their supply chain management cost a lot.   They don’t need to support the same board for 10 years.   They can simply change the model number of the exact same board every year and give you 1 year warranty and 2 or 3 year supports.,Positive
AMD,AM4 was still  a good platform to buy into even when AM5 released.,Positive
AMD,"Every time I got a new am4 cpu I got a new mobo and ram, but that was just because I had sold my older am4 stuff. If not I would still stick with a b350 itx mobo and would use an 5800x3d. But I remember how Amd screwed over many am4 owners that had to upgrade to newest am4 board just to use zen3 cpus before AMD change its mind when am4 was eol. And remember when zen/+ was still a thing many techtuber recommended very expensive ram at the time, b-die.   Then when intel launched its skylake 8/9/10 the ram question was not as important anymore for the techtubers and yet fast ram was and still to this day is important for intel. Am on my 4th am5 system as well :P But I would not have been so if I did not damage one of the pins in the cpu socket on my lga1700 system that I loved the most of all my modern systems.   My lga1700 cpus before last summer did top out at say 140-160w of power draw in gaming, ie the loading of the map is included. My am4 cold pull 110w and so could my am5 cpus. The funny thing with lga1700 is that after last summer my 12700k would start to pull 200-220w in wz/bf. and that with only 8 p cores at 5.2ghz and 4.8ghz rinbus with ram at 7600/7800mt/s.   The funny thing is that 13900kf I hav only pulls 180w at most at 5.5ghz/5ghz ringbus with the same memory settings. And I am using the same bios, same max unlocked settings but the only thing that has changed is the windows version, drivers and game updates.",Neutral
AMD,My first AM4 CPU was the 5800X3D. Though I did buy it launch day sight unseen,Neutral
AMD,"They're making the same mistakes over and over again.    There is no real doubt that the upgrade itself is cheaper, but there are a couple of problems in their takes:  1. They conveniently chose their upgrade times to fit their narrative. An upgrade at a different time would not have been as good of a deal.   2. The difference between the 1700X and 7700k was bigger than between the 14600k and 5800X3D according to their own testing? Why not use the part that was closer in performance?  3. If you bought Zen 1, you bought a 300 series motherboard and slower RAM with it. An AM4 upgrade would also have required a RAM upgrade, negating a lot of what you save.  4. Early 300 series boards, especially B350 had a lot of trouble with RAM and there are a lot of tests that show that modern AM4 CPUs don't run at their full potential and can't use memory that is as good.    You lose out on PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 too and are stuck with horrendously outdated I/O.    Why didn't they test the 5800X3D or 5700X on an actual B350 board?    They're whole argument is based on running a Zen 3 CPU with faster RAM on a different mainboard.   And that's just on their methodology.   The more general ""problems"" with platform longevity:  \- Using AM4 as an example is bad, because it only looks so good because Zen 1 sucked. It was overhyped, buying in on the ""the future will be multithreaded"" narrative and that's it. In gaming, Zen 1 was closer to Ivy Bridge or Haswell than Skylake.   \- They never asnwer the question on how much to factor it in in buying decision  \- They completely ignore that chipsets matter too, AMD only allowed Zen 3 much later on early AM4 boards (most oof which had some performance regression)  \- There is no guarantee in longevity. AMD always phrases it in a way that they're not liable for anything. They made the same promises about Threadripper and broke them thrice. After the first broken promise their new promises were even stronger. Why buy into a promise that the vendor will happily break if it benefits them?  \- There is no guarantee about performance. What if all new CPUs are a Zen 5% scenario all over again? You don't know before.   \- You still pay for it. In theory, a longer platform support is good but do they really think ""intel"" does it because they're greedy and AMD doesn't because they're friend?    In reality, neither AMD nor intel are really affected by that directly, motherboard vendors are. Do people really think that motherboard vendors are happy with having to support a product much longer and provide updates (which costs money) while lowering their own revenue due to that?    No, of course not. And that's why motherboard manufactures cheap out so much, especially on AM5 boards.    For the same price, motherboards are typically much worse on AM5, both in I/O and quality and that's likely also the reason why there are a lot more issues on AMD boards.    And the last point is important. Besides that, it seems to be simply a good thing to have longer socket support, but unfortunately that's not how it works.    If Asrock, Asus, MSI etc etc. sell you a motherboard that they'll have to support for ten years, they have to make the same profit with it as they would if you bought two boards fives years apart, otherwise they would hurt their business.",Negative

AMD,> OEMs have to buy all the various parts anyway so what does it matter if the platform changes yearly.   It does make it easier to maintain compatibility with old stock. If MSI struggled to sell out all their Tomahawks for prebuilds and had leftover stock when a new gen launched then instead of dumping it you do a bios update and sell it with a 10600x. This would be especially beneficial for builders like Dell that like their custom motherboards.,Neutral

Longevity makes sense if you like to upgrade every 3 years or so I guess. For the rest of us, it's not that much of a factor.",Positive

Zen 7 on AM5 or AM6 is an unknown; it'll likely hinge on when DDR6 is commercially available to consumers.  I know I'm not looking forward to replacing my motherboard because of the damn internal USB3 cable connector that is near impossible to remove.  For the prebuilt desktop market, you're right people rarely upgrade. But that market could also be easily serviced with soldered CPUs. Dell, HP, Lenovo and etc often use proprietary CPU coolers (incompatible with ATX boards), boards (e.g. some of Dell's desktop boards has a section that directly connects to the case's front I/O panel instead of using cable connections), PSUs and cases in their design, which already limits upgrade options.",Neutral

A last gen motherboard isn't worthless and thrown away, you can typically get quite a bit of money back on it.

I see both sides of the argument, but really don't feel like 1-2 generations per socket is actually a negative.",Neutral
AMD,"I agree with a lot of what U said/wrote. Zen1 was pretty crappy, and when I bought an 1600 with a b350 board and lpx 3000c15 2x8(sr sticks) I had not issues, becaue the ram was a single rank kit and would go to 3466 without any issues. My friend which is a AMD fan, since waaay back(like me) used his phenom until zen 1 came lunched, and he bought the most expensive 1800x/msi x350 and 3200 dr kit which he could not get to work until like zen+ was a couple of months old.  When I did some head to head comparisons the r5 1600 basically was slower than my 3770k with ddr3, crazy. bf should have been the base case scenario for the zen cpu.  The ram back then was pretty meh, until b-die got recommended as a standard, and it was a fairly costly recommendation from the techtubers, and today the market is filled with only craptastic ddr4 ram. But when zen 3 launched we did not see them push for fast ram on the intel side like they did for am4.  Still remember that the techtubers showed super skewed ram settings, handicapping intel back then, and still the thing up to today, even if 7200from hub is pretty okey, even though that ram was not premium at all back then, was about the same price as my 6000c30 for my amd rig.(same hynix ram basically)  Long socket support is of most importance to me, but not for my friends that no longer are that hw interested, but for sure it would have made it easier for them if that was the case when they upgraded after a few years.  Pretty sure the 5% ""allegory"" or so is what we have to expect now from all cpus in gaming. Dont think where will be any cpu that can push an 5090 at all that much more than we already see. We will basically still see it being bottlenecked at lower res/settings like we do today.",Neutral

AMD,"I spent about $110 in total upgrading from a Ryzen 1600 to a 5600x (sold the 1600 after the upgrade to get the $110 cost), and this was on a $75 Asrock B450m Pro4 board.  My only regret was not waiting another year for 5700X3D to show up. One of my friends bought that CPU for a little over $120 on Aliexpress.  EDIT: I looked back at my old research I did when I initially built my Ryzen 1600 desktop. The Intel build for about the same CPU+board cost was an i3-9100F with a H310 or B360 board, which meant no CPU/RAM overclocking and no cost effective upgrade path. Meanwhile I had overclocked the 1600 on the Pro4 board and ran it with DDR4-3200 (the i3-9100F only supports up to DDR4-2400).  An extra $110 for ""future-proofing"" the Intel CPU would yield maybe an i5-9400F or 9600K (on the same locked down H/B board, because a Z series board easily add +$100 to the cost), both of which put it in direct competition against a Ryzen 3600 + Pro4 build and would lose against an overclocked 5600x and especially the 5700X3D.",Neutral

AMD,I'm specifically talking about NOT doing piecemeal upgrades. Which necessarily means not caring about what motherboard you buy along with the CPU when upgrading.   In isolation AM4 upgrades look impressive but it is rather due to the base effect of early Zen being pretty crap in gaming.  It is reflected in the graphs too.  8700K -> 10900K gave you the same uplift through one upgrade that you would have to do three upgrades on AM4 (1800X ->5800X).

So if you were an early adopter of lets say a 12900k:  $670 MSRP for the CPU   ~$200 for the DDR5 kit (it was very expensive even for lower end kits in the early days)   $300+ for even an entry level Z690 Prime motherboard  All of that extra money JUST to overtake the existing 5800x by 25%.

Overall though, it's a weird market segment to estimate/predict. Vast majority of people in the market for ""a computer"" buy laptops. The remainder that decides to get a desktop, still more often than not goes for various kinds/levels of prebuilts. Only tiny sliver of the market actually buys parts to build a PC - and it's the only sliver where I'd expect significant chunk of customers to consider upgrading individual components.  Purely anecdotal, but even among the people I know, who built their own PCs, I pretty often see no upgrades at all. Just riding out initial setup for as long as it's viable before replacing the whole thing.  That said though, even more limited group of people I know and consider gaming/PC enthusiasts, *do* upgrade their GPUs additional one or two times between platform upgrades.

Spinning drives, not usb ssds, because they want a terabyte or two or four for really cheap. It supplements the usually small ssd that people get with their computers.  Covid wfh normalized ultrawides and dual monitors for a lot of people, so monitors became a common upgrade.   Gpus are bought by people who game regularly on their pc which is a subset of pc owners. Consoles sell better than gpus because again, no need to open a pc up to get this gen gaming. Opening PCs and installing parts is a big hurdle for people to overcome.

AMD,"To be fair, AMD's strategy is because they're used in consoles. Every technical decision they've made has been dictated by the cost constraints of developing console hardware. What you get in the desktop was paid for by the console manufacturers and it is as powerful and feature-packed as the console manufacturers were willing to pay.   What I mean is, AMD's strategy with RT was meant to be cheap because it's the way Sony and MS got to have the tech while also not having spiraling hardware costs. Rdna2 is basically the tech those consoles got scaled up and rDNA 3 was rdna 2+.   Rdna4 was basically a rehash of what Sony paid for the ps5 pro. And rdna5 is likely going to be a beef up version of whatever the console manufacturers pay for the 2027 season.    AMD doesn't have anywhere near the r&d money nvidia has and it doesn't have the deep pockets Intel has to throw money to a hard problem until they crack it.   I'm going to be the first to complain about their lack of software strategy, but their hardware strategy makes sense when you consider they get a tenth of the market share nvidia gets and for the longest time had revenue much smaller than Intel's and Nvidia's. They make the best use of the tech MS and Sony pay for their consoles.    Maybe this time they will use that sweet sweet AI money to flesh out their hardware, but I'm not holding my breath. It's clear they have a hard time convincing buyers to give them a try.",Neutral

AMD,1440p quality DLSS is a slight downgrade for better FPS. It’s worth it every time.,Positive
AMD,"Native is not a magic resolution where everything is correct. This is a statement people keep making that sounds correct if you don't think about it, but it's just flatly wrong.      Tons of geometry and textures have detail that can be smaller than a pixel in games today. The vast majority of effects and basically all the lighting (whether ray traced or not) is initially rendered at lower than native resolution.  TAA is already used in basically every game because of how common deferred rendering is. If TAA weren't used, the flickering and aliasing would be so intense it would make games unplayably bad.    Even if none of that were true, the idea of native being ""correct"" makes no sense. We would have had no need then for antialiasing techniques like SSAA or MSAA.    DLSS and all upscaling techniques today are a form of super sampling. It's just that they trade off spatial resolution and do the super sampling temporally. Using data from past frames is obviously worse than just rendering at a higher resolution in a vacuum. But you need cheap anti aliasing that covers everything anyway. And basically every game needs temporal accumulation (to run effects at sub-native resolution) in order to run fast enough with good enough visual quality anyway. And if you really can create an algorithm that effectively reuses data from past frames, then it can both look better and run faster than native.    Now could there be edge cases where something looks worse? Sure. All you need to do is look at FSR2/3 to see how worse algorithms make a ton more tradeoffs. But with good techniques, there will also be many situations where it can look better.    And if you truly care about quality above all else, then you can turn up graphical settings when introducing some upscaling. You'd have to compare something like ""Native"" with Low settings to DLSS with Medium or High settings (turning up the most impactful graphical settings until the framerate was the same).    Personally, at 4K output,  DLSS is always worth turning on. Your dumb PC gamer gatekeeping is hilarious because PC has by far the best upscaling and the most ways to tweak it.",Negative

AMD,"In 2020, during the RTX 3000 series launch, Nvidia tried to control HU's videos because HU ""did not focus enough"" on DLSS. I believe it was either by refusing to send FE cards, or directly by telling them what to write? Not sure anymore, but after a public outcry and support from LTT, GN, and other outlets, Nvidia reversed their course.  Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Only around the Radeon RX 9000 series release did HU balance their coverage. I believe this was because both companies, AMD and Nvidia, had done so much anti-consumer shit by that point, that the public hated them (almost) equally.  Before this launch, the Reddit majority opinion was ""AMD has shittier drivers, but GPUs are much better value, and we can handle worse FSR for the price difference, also they are much better for Linux and fuck Nvidia for many valid reasons"". After the launch, Nvidia invested into Linux drivers (but had Windows driver issues of their own), AMD did the same shit with pricing, and DLSS pulled away far enough from FSR that the difference became too difficult to ignore. Both companies now have done so much anti-consumer shit in one way or another that they are evenly disliked, imo.",Neutral

If amd follow the hate blindly then they'll just be left behind at this point just like how they didn't believe at dlss at first and so did many people including reviewers.

AMD,"> Nonetheless: HU did not take this story well. They were previously indeed focusing on rasterized performance. After this Nvidia stunt, they continued to do that, and it took them until about ~2022/2023 when they finally started properly and broadly testing FSR/DLSS - after it became evident that a) there's enough games that support it and b) there is a demand for coverage from the pubic, because gamers are actually using it.  I mean that's a fair attitude no? People might disagree with it, but that's not evidence of bias, it's just an opinion on the value of RT. RT has only really come into fruition in the last few years, before then it was a reflective puddle that halved the frame rate or something. Not focussing lots of benchmarking RT for the perhaps 5 games where it is worth it does make sense.  >Even still, a lot of their FSR vs DLSS comparisons did acknowledge that DLSS was better, but the wording was always casting AMD in a better, or at least a good, light. Either FSR wasn't far behind DLSS, or the price differences on GPUs made AMD a better purchase, or whatever other reason they could find, but they had a very clear pro-AMD bias.  Since DLSS 2 (1 was awful), they've always said DLSS was better than FSR. At times FSR wasn't that far behind DLSS, and when AMD cards were a fair bit cheaper it might be been worth it for some.

For someone who actually bothered look at what Imagination latest designs achieved and imagine what scaling that up to dGPU power would do. Lot of AMD's latest design philosophy in their patent filings align with this (not surprising given their RT HW lead is from that company) so it's more likely than not that RDNA 5 will completely annihilate 50 series in RT traversal perf.

Odds are the way things are going that Zen 6 either releases very late this year, or most likely early next year.  /note: there is still a chance for more X3D chips in the 9000 series like a 9600X3D.

That one specifically is great for validating errors from too low CO, my understanding is specific instruction sets are more prone to errors with too low CO settings, but if you're never gonna use those, some just live with it knowing it can fail AIDA64 within seconds.  Never tested that claim myself though since I wanted mine to be stable at all times in all circumstances.",Neutral
AMD,"And you're completely certain the 11370H is binned with the exact same criteria as the 1185G7? Because from what I can see, the 11370H has a higher TDP target, meaning it could easily have been binned after the 1185G7, and Intel just allowed it to be binned worse.  Besides, it's not even clocking higher. If your theory were to be correct, the 11390H should be targeting a higher peak boost than the 1195G7. By higher peak boost, I mean something like 5.2 GHz, or even 5.3 GHz (ludicrous for Tiger Lake).",Neutral

AMD,This clocks and voltages on 50 series are pure joy you know :)   And yest its smart move to have multiple profiles for games especially for RT games! Tbh I play on 4k TV 60hz so I lock at 60fps + DLSSQ + 925mv - 2500mhz gives me best Power Draw to Performance around +-150W as I try to keep it under 200W because if I have flat 60fps am happy,Positive
AMD,Well am not gonna write you elaborate 😅 so I will try to explain what I ment by gains in simple words! 😏   Look when I said about latency test in PYPrime 2b this test measures how fast Memory exchange data with CPU so theoretically faster ram 6400+ should give you faster data transfer but unfortunately UDIMM's with higher clocks are losing timings and while you do that you're latency growing so as example I use standard EXPO 6000c30/38/38/96 and in AIDA Latency test it get 75.3ns and after all my tuning on my old R7 7700 I get 57.6ns almost 20ns fastery Ram exchanged data with CPU and because of this I get uplift in games especially in 1% Low but Biggest gains I felt and feel is in System Responsiveness like apps like browser file explorer and other apps like these started opening immediately! You click and app is open and ready to go + feeling of mouse how smooth suddenly become! Even likes of Steam opening visible quicker!    But having 9800x3D gives you uplift because of extra 64mb cache and this cache too exchanging data with memory so when your extra cache can exchange data faster you get more performance all for free!!   So if you have any more questions and I can try to answer you 😏,Neutral
AMD,No i understand. I believe everything is explained in the description of the project on github much better than i could explain it.,Positive
AMD,"Gotcha, ultimately you do you.  If you are programming though, I do recommend getting AIDA64, just plug in one of the codes you find on Reddit and give it an hour long spin while you eat or something.  Most instabilities are found within seconds to minutes, so it's pretty fast.  Don't want any errors with your programming work that is caused by unstable hardware, so I'll recommend giving it a try when you feel like it one day, though again, plenty of people just live with it.",Positive
AMD,"Running it too far in the edge daily is dumb, because CPUs degrade over time.    It can run well today, but in a week or in a year, especially after updates, it might not run stable anymore. Such errors are hard to detect, if it happens.   It might also degrade faster when running it on the edge.",Negative
AMD,Interesting because before 9800x3D I was suing 7700 which  seems Golden One because I was able to set +200mhz + FCLK 2200 + CO -30 All Cores Per Core and it took it as a champ but if I set even single core at CO -31 IMC aka Memory Controller inside CPU stared to crash even I could set like -125! System was booting I was able to pass some testes but IMC no no! And with this settings +200 CO -30 at stock 90W 7700 beat 7700x 140W in CB r26 scoring 4885pts and hitting 5hgz all cores!  But real gains I seen when set negative offset on CPU -0.500mv on the top of CO -30! Right away my 7700 dropped idle power draw from 34W-36W to 25W-26W exactly like 9700x-9800x3D and when I unlocked it to 170W it score 5063pts in CB r26 and all cores boost was 5.5ghz!      So my conclusion is does your IMC work or scram errors!?,Positive
AMD,My monitor is 200hz 1449 but I have it capped at 144 for similar reasons. I usually use DLAA which limits max FPS for me   I am waiting for the summers to really hit (it gets up to 45C at times here) to kinda do a second pass at all the settings balancing power and heat,Neutral
AMD,"Im using my PC like 6 hours a week. I really dont care about degradation. If it fails in like 4 years, I\`ll buy a new one",Neutral
AMD,You know that playing with DLAA you use full power and DLSS reduce power draw about +-30W but as we can see 50 series undervolt and OC better so as long you happy and all works than who cares 🤷🏻‍♀️😎✌️👉,Positive
AMD,It's more efficient to do this for smaller igpus. Any rt upgrades from rdna4 is wasted area because none of these will run rt at any acceptable perf in real use. You'd rather cut the area for lower cost or increase the wgp count and even with those igpus are still bottlenecked by bandwidth at ~16 cu which covers most consumer segments  Benchmarks ain't gonna like this but it's probably the right thing to do for real use. Consumer markets are goin to shit due to ram prices so enterprise mobile that can withstand the ram shortage better with greater margins and less gaming focus is where shares are gonna be gained  In the end the top igpu pantherlake turned out to be a benchmark pleaser for gamers but not practical for the current market. The rampocalypse that shifts market momentum away from premium gaming to cost focused and enterprise systems is gonna be a coincidental boon for amd's mobile sales.,Neutral
AMD,"Makes sense, RDNA 4 was designed to only scale down to 32CUs. Backporting some of the key features to RDNA 3.5 is probably easier than redesigning RDNA 4.",Neutral
AMD,"It's a common misunderstanding in ""enthusiast"" forums - that the ""Later Generation"" is just *better* at everything in every way.  For example, if you cut down a zen4 to hit a lower power and area target, at a known acceptable loss of peak performance, it'll probably look a *lot* like a tweaked zen3. So why not just tweak the zen3?  Not every design decision that went into making RDNA4 from RDNA3 likely makes sense for smaller form factors, power and performance targets, or even different environments (like different vram/bandwidth ratios). It may be that backporting the things that *do* make sense is simpler than cutting half of what you just added out of the design again.",Neutral
AMD,> none of these will run rt at any acceptable perf in real use  There are lower RT loads like Lumite's optional use of hardware RT.,Neutral
AMD,"yeah while i want the day where apu have good RT performance to be here, it aint anywhere close. giving die area for ML stuff for upscaling and raster for the rest of the games while still having somewhat usable RT for optimized games like TDA is the mission atm",Negative
AMD,"rt in general is a waste. because even now. games are largely really baked in. most effects are either baked in, or approximated anyway with denoising. not to mention it made devs a lot lazier, rely on engine, and now every game looks the same and poorly optimized. a lot of games that should have a distinct lighting and artstyle are now photorealistic because its a lot cheaper than baking in lighting.",Negative

AMD,The ISA has nothing to do with hardware designs.,Neutral
AMD,"Not to mention, better to save that time to finish UDNA one and then do a new iGPU arch once that's working.",Positive
AMD,"But why would ya turn that on over higher base presets or a more consistent locked fps at 60? Someone running a midrange igpu would be targeting 1080p 60 raster, not 1080p 40 with rt on. The focus would be on upscaling support and raster capabilities, rt is a distant afterthought  And that's gaming. For enterprise laptops rt capabilities have almost 0 use, it's 99% wasted area. We know that both intel and amd are moving supplies to dc and enterprise. Both lip bu tan and lisa su said so in their most recent earnings call. Amd downplayed the impact of ram prices and said they were focusing on enterprise, intel blamed the consumer market and said they regretted supplying it and are shifting as much as they can to other markets  The story of the next 2years in consumer is kinda ""you're in luck if you can even afford midrange stuff"", forget about premium experiences that push the envelope. Was this really planned by amd? Probably not, they probably cut most rdna4 products to focus on a larger architectural reset with rdna5 and have a gap between rdna3.5 and rdna5 but they lucked out here because of the market conditions.",Neutral

AMD,"Not what they're saying though. First commenter is saying that for AMD it's cheaper to transform preexisting RDNA3.5 igpus into some sort of RDNA 4 lite with FSR4 support, compared to designing a 4WGP RDNA4/5 igpu from scratch while minimizing area usage.  No idea if that's true (the part about not scaling down below 32CUs is definitely sus) but doesn't sound crazy",Neutral

AMD,but they will still be releasing new apus with rdna3 in 2027 :D  hell the shity steam machine will come with rdna3....,Positive
AMD,Where did you get the info that RDNA3 is going into maintenance mode in late 2027?,Neutral
AMD,"Exactly, not just handhelds and apus/igpus, but also the rx 7700, released just a few months ago, its actually their most recent desktop gpu, newer than any of the rdna4 cards",Neutral
AMD,This will be the most ironic thing on hardware ever lol.. LINUX EXCLUSIVE,Neutral
AMD,"DLSS4.5 still looks the same on all cards AFAIK, it's just the performance that differs.   INT8 FSR looks worse, so they'd either have to live with that, or brand it as ""FSR Lite"" or something.",Negative
AMD,"IRC the main issue is that the older architectures lack the AI features required. In which case the fumbling isn't that they didn't want to port FSR4 backwards, but that they completely failed to implement forward planning with earlier architectures.   Which just seems silly with how popular DLSS was.",Negative
AMD,"You can't ""take advantage"" of being the underdog. You are *forced* to be the underdog in the hopes that you will die.  The entire high end is a complete waste of silicon. The xx90 cards shouldn't even exist, but Nvidia doesn't care because they have infinite money.",Negative
AMD,There is a reason their market share dropped below 10%  Most people have stopped buying them.,Negative
AMD,Because this isn't happening. You are describing unreality.,Negative
AMD,It's actually mindboggling just how forward looking Turing was. Here are the features from the Turing architecture PDF:  * ML hardware (tensor cores) * ML based upscaler (was trash initially but aged like fine wine) * Level 3 RT HW with BVH traversal HW (RT cores) * RTRT pipeline (initially a gimmick but DDGI and later improvements changed that) * VRS + Content adaptive shading + motion adaptive shading * Various VR gains (foveated rendering + Multi view rendering) * Sampler feedback and texture space shading * Mesh shaders (clean slate rendering pipeline) * 2 x FP16 (I know vega introduced) * L1+Shmem design * Concurrent INT + FP (IIRC AMD already had) * Improved resource management (tier 2) and binding model (tier 3) * Very efficient vs Pascal (perf/mm\^2 vs perf/watt tradeoff) * GDDR6 * Big memory compression gains * Very good encoder  No doubt their largest leap since ~~Kepler~~ Tesla in 2006.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah it's actually kind of funny to go back and watch all the shit Turing got at the time from everyone, reviewers on down, when in reality looking back Turing will likely be seen as one of the most influential and important GPU releases of all time.   All three vendors make to Turing's base design of shader/ai/RT cores now, and as you said the fact that it took AMD over 6 years to finally throw in the towel, and really only with outside money from Sony, just shows how unconcerned and uncompetitive they truly are. I really miss ATI :/",Negative

AMD,"I swapped my 5700xt to a 5070ti and I have no regrets. I loved my old card but AMD really just falls flat on software features and support.

AMD,so is dlss 4.5 for older nvidia gpus,Neutral
AMD,"Ok, and DLSS4 and 4.5 have bigger performance hits on each subsequent past generation down to the RTX 2000s but Nvidia still lets you use it anyway. No excuse for AMD. It's *already optional*. Why not give users more freedom of choice? You know, one of the biggest reasons for PC gaming.",Neutral
AMD,"More than native, less than FSR 3.1. So it's still a net positive which I would take with my 7800XT.",Positive
AMD,"Nvidia gave us an option despite the fact that DLSS4 and DLSS4.5 aren't that huge in difference, basically from good to good upscaler. Meanwhile FS3 vs FSR4 can't even compare  in visuals,  performance hit would make more sense in this case with visual gain. I bet 7900 users at least would appreciate it....",Positive
AMD,It runs about the same as the new dlss4.5,Neutral
AMD,"It's definitely a case of branding issue, they're probably weighing between not releasing it at all or they could brand it FSR 4 Lite.  Or their internal statistics indicate that people buy 9000 series for FSR Redstone",Neutral
AMD,"They could have released an official version with a disclaimer ""it is what it is, don't expect updates"". But they don't. For exactly no reason.",Negative
AMD,Eh.,Neutral
AMD,"Is it worse than FSR3 on these cards? That’s the important question. If it is an upgrade over FSR3, releasing it for these cards:  1. Gives them a meaningful upgrade, and, 2. Increases the userbase of FSR4 cards, reducing market fragmentation and improving the market for FSR. The fact that EVERY RTX card ever released supports the latest DLSS is a big deal.",Neutral
AMD,Nah if Steam Machine hacks it or releases with it that'll be the final nail in the coffin. But it needs massive pushback from big YouTubers otherwise nothing will happen.,Negative
AMD,Why would they?,Neutral
AMD,Any release after the release of FSR4 is not ahead of time but late with required penalties.,Negative
AMD,"> ahead of time  where does anyone claim, that the fsr4 int8 version was released ahead of time?  at this point the most likely reason for its release was a disgruntled developer ""accidentally"" hitting publish with an mit license, because they worked on it for ages and were pissed off, that amd didn't want to release it, or it was really an actual mistake.  either way there is now many many months later NO reason to assume, that amd has plans to release the int8 version for rdna2 or rdna3. it wasn't an early release by accident. amd clearly didn't want people to know about it. IF they did, then they would have said, that they are working on it before massive endless backlash about it. they have done the opposite and showed people the middle finger.  and you want people to celebrate a middle finger from a giant tech company?",Negative
AMD,"Because that's what people like to do with AMD. NO matter how good their products are, they're AWFUL.",Negative
AMD,"People seem to forget that all this is based on a leaked beta or even alpha stage backport of FSR4. We don't know why AMD didn't release it. Maybe they didn't have the manpower, so they prioritized RDNA4. Maybe they weren't satisfied with INT8 and switched to FP8 later. Maybe Sony is heavily involved with the development and there are contracts in place that forbid a release. Maybe there are some libraries or technologies they have to license and they just don't want to pay the bills. Or maybe they are gonna release it as FSR 3.5 or whatever.",Negative
AMD,"Yet Nvidia, the company that always been labelled as ""Don't give a shit about gaming, only AI, don't care about gamer"", still have a whole gaming talk show at CES, introduced new GAMING features like DLSS 4.5 and 6x MFG, not only the BEST GAMING FEATURES in the market with insanely wide game support, but coming to all RTX gpus dated back to 2018, 4 generations ago. They also promote a bunch of games and showcase many new AAA sponsored games with those technologies.  If all those things Nvidia did to gaming are ignored and treated as a given, and still got them labelled as ""Don't care about gaming, only focus on AI"", then what the fuck is AMD, who give literally nothing compared to Nvidia, and on top of that treating their consumers like shit by abandoning all the previous gen",Negative
AMD,if they didn't give a shit then they would have no reason to block FSR4,Negative

AMD,Except evidence shows Nvidia cares more about consumers than AMD does.,Neutral
AMD,"The prevailing wisdom (never confirmed by AMD) is that either RDNA4 doesn't scale down well to a 12/16 CU part suitable for APUs or that they were hoping to have UDNA (which is much more modular for use in dGPUs, SOCs and servers) ready for integration much sooner.",Neutral
AMD,"NVIDIA's shield market was/is absolutely tiny and yet it has supported the platform for 7 years now including with it AI-enhancement features. Fact of the matter is, NVIDIA for all its faults supports its past products extensively whereas AMD just looks for excuses to drop support which is why the former has built up such a monopoly in the gaming segment. People who have purchased both NVIDIA and AMD cards at some point can see the difference in support between the two and it has affected AMD long term even if people dont like to admit it.",Positive
AMD,RDNA 2 and 3 still make up the majority of the AMD users. There's just no excuse.,Neutral
AMD,"That's absolutely true, but it's a new and growing segment. AMD treating it so poorly is such a short sighted move, as carving out the segment is not only good for AMD but for x86 as a whole.  With the way AMD is handling the segment, it leaves the door wide open for Intel to take over, they already have more efficient chips, better iGPUs and XeSS 3 works on all Arc GPUs, whether it's their desktop dGPUs or their oldest and cheapest Arc iGPUs on laptops.",Neutral
AMD,correction pc handheld is tiny the actual handhelds people want already has nvidia making the chip,Neutral
AMD,"It is very small, but it's also ine of the few sectors that is clearly growing over the last few years.  AMD run the risk if just tossing it away whilst chasing AI.",Negative
AMD,So is AMD's share of the GPU market.  Because they keep getting all trigger-happy at the sight of their own feet.,Negative
AMD,"Around 6 million sold Steam&nbsp;Decks I wouldn't call exactly tiny …  It's at least enough market-meat to fight over, for Intel *and* Microsoft try to engage on that ""absolutely tiny"" market-niche with Intel through the MSI Claw (among others), and Microsoft wanting to refit their whole OS for it.  So it might be a corner of the market, yet there seems to be enough money to be made to make it worthwhile.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep!  I'm running Bazzite on my Legion GO and use a combination of the Proton variable for FSR4 and Decky/Optiscaler plugin for XeSS.  It's also hilarious to me that the Source release blunder means that, technically, the INT8 code was released under the MIT License.  So they can't even stop people from redistributing it.",Neutral
AMD,"> Your entire perception of what the market looks like is wildly incorrect.  In what way?  The handheld gaming market is fairly niche, but absolutely gaining momentum.  What we know for sure, is that Intel is ready to drop new hardware that is significantly faster than AMD (who have no plans for at least 12 months).  That's a pretty big opening for Intel to grab up market share based on technical superiority alone.",Neutral
AMD,"From what I've seen on my LeGo, it's still worth it.  On the gen1 Legion Go it's actually uniquely positioned to benefit as it has a 2560x1600 screen, so running FSR4 in performance mode nets a better image than a native Steamdeck (1280x800).  The main benefit is that FSR4 doesn't break up horribly like FSR3 does at low resolutions. e.g.  FSR3 performance on most handheld screens is a garbled mess.",Positive

AMD,"Rumor is that Valve is working on an optimized FSR4 for the Steam Machines, but you can already enable FSR4 using Proton-GE.",Neutral
AMD,"According to HW Unboxed, the int 8 version of fsr4 is visually better than xess2 dp4a while having a similar performance impact. It’s an improvement over what’s already there on the market and AMD refuses to release it.",Positive
AMD,"FSR 3.8 is fine; not quite FP8 FSR4, so brand it under FSR3. It can mark the end of the FSR 3.x line.  Not sure why they're being stubborn about FSR4. Honestly, AMD could just use conversion instructions and provide full FSR4 to RDNA3/3.5 and 3.7 (""RDNA4m""). I think, maybe, AMD wants GPUs to support the entire Redstone stack going forward. That's where FSR 3.8 branding makes sense as a standalone upscaler based on FSR4.",Neutral

AMD,"Turing was absolutely forward-looking, but it was also comparatively expensive at launch and didn't offer the big gen-on-gen raster gains everyone had become accustomed to. We know it was the future *now*, but if you were looking at it back then as a Maxwell or Pascal owner it didn't really do much to sell itself.   Meanwhile AMD came out with the 5700XT that offered ballpark 1080ti performance for $399. It's not hard to see why the narrative went the way it did.",Negative
AMD,Turing’s super refresh also addressed the value aspect. I don’t know any unhappy 2000 Super buyers.,Neutral
AMD,Even funnier when you look at Intel and Arc. Arc released with RT and ML in mind and I believe their cards take a lower hit from enabling RT than AMD's.   And even XeSS 2 is getting features before FSR,Neutral
AMD,"And funny how RDNA 1 like 5700XT at the time was treated as gold standard compared to Turing, which everyone trashing on, now RDNA 1 is not even supported for driver anymore, can't run many games due to lacking even mesh shader, zero RT hardware so can't run many new games, and even if it could the experience is horrible with absolutely garbage upscaling and zero feature, the 5700XT aged like rotten milk while Turing is more than fine wine",Negative
AMD,"To be fair ray tracing is still not really a thing that's worth the performance hit, which is what people were saying back then.  DLSS, which is now the real ""magic"" of RT cores, was also ***horrendous*** in its first incarnation, wasn't  *really* needed, and only really got acceptable in late 2022 with DLSS 3.  Doesn't change the fact that you're right about everyone clowning on it but it turned out to be a pivotal tech though...

AMD,"No they don´t always have to be the reason of their own downfall. AMD was an absolute CPU Underdog up to 2018/19 and built their way up with fair prices, meaningful improvements and big promises like supporting AM4 for a long time. My support was rewarded as I got a cheap upgrade possibility by selling my 3600 and buying a 5800X3D.     I gave them my trust with the GPUs too and my old Sapphire 5700XT Nitro+ did a good job by having an awesome buy and sellprice (bought it for 360 euros brand new in 11/19 and for 160 in 02/24) and a good feature support. Why shouldn´t I give AMD another try? The Underdog did deliver a great value for me.",Positive

AMD,"Maybe it's just me, but going from a 7900XTX to a 4090 was a night and day difference, even in linux. 4090 *just worked*. Whereas the AMD card would have constant driver timeouts and crashes in specific games(especially those that didn't like AMD in the first place) despite being RMA'd twice.  Sure, maybe i got unlucky, but i've had pretty much zero problems with nvidia on linux. Maybe it's because i run a rolling release distro though, i can see it being rough if you're constantly on older versions via LTS or something like bazzite which is immutable.",Neutral
AMD,It would be really nice to see Nvidia open up their drivers on Linux because that is a real sticking point for many. We just rely on Nvidia to fix stuff there for us instead of being able to do it ourselves. You would think considering Linux is the primary OS in industry they would support it better?,Positive
AMD,"You don't have to as your 9070 XT will work fine with FSR4 while my 7800XT will artificially get castrated because AMD sold me Hardware they themselves don't use (""AI Cores"")",Negative

AMD,"If that ends up being the case, which i find highly doubtful, at least on the short-mid term, specially knowing that there's a very real possibility that the AI bubble ends up bursting, there will always be Intel as a secondary option(and even if Intel wasn't there and the AI bubble never bursts, it literally makes no sense for NVIDIA to completely abandon a market where they hold more than 70% of total market sales. What is likely to happen is that NVIDIA puts less and less focus on gaming GPUs, but never stops making them fully)  And if Intel is shit too, i would rather not buy a GPU at all than give money to Radeon again.",Negative

AMD,"Honestly, releasing it with a SPECIAL name would be the best solution. Like FSR4 lite or FSR4 preview name.",Positive
AMD,"Most consumers, even if they have a custom PC, will default to ""install the latest drivers"". If that means negative performance, I can see a good reason why AMD would not release such a driver.",Negative

AMD,"There is a lot of negativity on reddit towards AMD. for upscaling there are two things to consider: quality and performance.

AMD,"I'd say the ""Nvidia research to standard feature pipeline"" has been pretty well established at this point... RTX, DLSS, Framegen, Reflex, Gsync, other AI rendering stuff (RR, NRC, NTC)... sure, they're not the ones who ""invent"" them sometimes (although they do contribute a shit ton of research in novel fields that people typically don't know about until it hits consumer products), but they're clearly the driving force behind modern gaming features.   Part of that might be corporate culture, part of it might just be that Nvidia's 90% of the gaming market, part of it is just gaming adapting to the hardware the market provides (if you're a AAA game dev now or developing any sort of technically ambitious feature, you are building your engine/game from the ground up with features like RT/PT/DLSS/Framegen/NRC whatever else from the ground up- future cards are going to have insane matrix math capabilities to support AI, so we take our current gaming computation problems and turn them into matrix math problems- that's just the general hardware market shaping gaming tech).   There's a feedback loop, but yeah, Nvidia's certainly putting in the work, and I'm sure they *wish* they could make an extra billion or two sellings GPUs to gamers on top of their AI profits- current supply and demand doesn't support that though.",Positive
AMD,"The whole ""NVIDIA doesn't care about gaming"" idea has always been absolute bullshit. Obviously no massive corporation ""cares"" in the way we humans might care about something, that is a given. But the idea that NV is somehow *uniquely disdainful* of gamers is childish and facile, and has no basis in observable fact.   If anything, it's the opposite: as someone who has been a PC gaming enthusiast for decades, I think NV has actually done more for me in that position than any other company (except, perhaps, Valve). Obviously they do so for business reasons; but the way they decide to act has been frequently beneficial to PC gaming.  As one massive (for me) example, I remember the first post-CRT decade in the monitor market where 60 Hz was just seen as **the** standard, and that was basically it. Which was very bleak from an action gaming perspective. And what really started to change that whole trajectory was the introduction of G-Sync -- not so much just the technology itself but more so getting the whole stagnant monitor industry to see the value of creating gaming-focused products.",Neutral

Within a year or two, the OpenCL backend on AMD slowly started [accumulating bugs](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/65924) that blender devs couldn't fix from their end and everyone had to fallback to using CPU rendering, which is magnitudes slower than GPU rendering.

High performing matrix cores were probably a requirement for a high quality temporal upscaler and RT denoiser as well.

The upscaler also wasn't great as Nvidia was trying to make the tensor cores do too many things at once.  DLSS2 was where Nvidia turned the corner. That actually started with shader-based DLSS 1.9 that debuted in Control. This moved to a generalized training algorithm based on temporal multi-frame accumulation (TAA-based). Image softness and ghosting were still issues though, so AMD's contrast adaptive sharpening often provided better results when combined with a basic upscaler.  DLSS3/4/4.5 continued improving upscaler algorithms and models to where we are today. It took years to get to this point because missing pixel information was an issue when upscaling images.

Neither of these features existed in mainline DisplayPort at the time VESA had no intention of doing so.  It took nearly **2 years** after G-Sync was announced for VESA to announce their implementation into the DP1.2a spec and still more time after that because the LFC logic had to be built into the GPU (1st Gen G-Sync actually had LFC built-in to the custom ARM SBC they were using as the Display Controller+TCON).

The other option is to invest less and focus on staying competitive, and sell your products at a cheaper price. I think a healthy market can benefit from both approaches, but as an enthusiast I find the former more exciting.",Neutral

But it doesn't make 30fps have fast inputs like 60fps, or 120fps, and there'll be visual bugs of course, just depends what you notice.  Hell, I basically never use FSR frame gen or anything, which older RTX can use too btw, and XeSS is also getting it.

There were **tons** of displays releasing even many years after G-Sync hit the market (with a pretty damn solid initial implementation) that were almost unusable in actual VRR scenarios due to a complete lack of adaptive overdrive.  Let's not forget that a lot of the ""generic VRR"" monitors also several other issues that were unrelated to overdrive. For example a lot of them had a really, really narrow update frequency where VRR actually worked. With G-Sync it did not matter what your refresh was, it would also be VRR and smooth. It accomplished this by various techniques like doubling frames at the really low refresh rates.   With a lot of the early FreeSync monitors, we had monitors that would only enable VRR at specific update frequencies, like maybe 48-75 Hz and as soon as you had higher or lower FPS than that, VRR would get disabled. It was awful, and monitors didn't advertise their workable VRR-range either so you had to Google and pray that someone had tested it and written about it.",Negative

The Legion Go and ROG Ally sold well enough to get new models.  The Xbox Ally is a maybe, since hardware-wise it's fine but the software side is a mess.

Think about that for a second though, the company that is currently obsessed with shoving cloud subscriptions and CoPilot down everyone's throats actually built something for Windows for the niche handheld market.  Granted, they probably vibe-coded it....  The competition is ultimately good thing as it has at least forced hardware to be iterated through quite quickly.

I'm very excited for raising the baseline for cores in the CCX, but I'm not sure most people care except for enthusiasts.

If you asked me during the Zen3 generation (2020-2021) my guess would have been 8c would be a bottleneck in a very short time. Yet it isn't, even 6c performs quite well with just a tiny penalty in a minority of games.

For most tasks, the cpu is perfectly fine with 50-100GB/s of bandwidth, and you're typically better off with more memory, a better graphics card, etc. Computing using huge datasets, scientific computing, AI, graphics, all of these can benefit from more memory bandwidth.  The other reasons not to? Cost, and lack of upgradability. SOCAMM2 modules might be a solution (though will be initially a premium and unavailable), but typically there just isn't the performance reliability with socketed RAM vs soldered. AMD tried with Strix Halo, but concluded they could only offer a solution that involved soldered RAM, like Apple.

AMD,"It's market segmentation deliberately created by Intel, which AMD copied later on.  The first release of Nehalem (Bloomfield) was triple-channel with plenty of PCIe lanes, fully in line with how the PC was evolving up to that point.    Then they released a crippled toy version (Lynnfield) which had only two channels and a pathetic number of PCIe lanes, retroactively creating the HEDT market segment.  That HEDT segment became progressively more and more expensive, reaching a point where with one platform, your PCIe lanes were crippled unless you spent $1000 on the CPU.  AMD, in the Bulldozer era, still had a respectable number of PCIe lanes, though still two memory channels.  When they made AM4, they adopted the toy computer model with too few PCIe lanes, and still just two memory channels.  Threadripper was then created as a proper PC, in line with how things were going before Nehalem.  More memory channels, more PCIe lanes.  It wasn't priced too badly, either.  But after Intel stopped being able to compete in HEDT, AMD raised the floor of entry way too high.  I see no sign of a proper consumer PC platform being released any time soon.  The E-core spam strategy that Intel is following also suggests they have no intention of competing in HEDT again, either.  Which means AMD is unlikely to fix TR to have a sensible entry point.",Neutral
AMD,"The short answer is cost and low ROI for the majority of consumers. Most consumers don’t benefit much from the additional bandwidth, and if you do, you can get a quad or octa channel HEDT system.   Additionally, large cache (X3D) chips are pretty effective at reducing memory bandwidth demands.",Neutral
AMD,"The memory bottleneck is memory latency, not memory bandwidth. Adding more channels does very little to help with latency, and it adds a whole lot of cost.  Bandwidth is very helpful for some workloads, like AI (when running it on CPU), but most workloads don't benefit from it. People who need lots of bandwidth go buy a server grade CPU with more memory channels to fit their workload.",Negative
AMD,They do that.  They charge a huge premium for it that no one wants to pay.  Look up AMD Threadripper and Intel Xeon W. They both support 4-channel on the lower-end models and 8-channel on the higher-end models.,Neutral

AMD,The cost in silicon space seems significant. https://www.pcmasters.de/system/photos/20393/full/Intel_Core_i9-13900K-Die_Shot.jpg  Though maybe they could shrink the integrated GPU for that or move it off-die?,Neutral
AMD,Had a couple of old I7-9XX builds that had triple channel memory. No idea if it had better performance than the dual channel versions.,Neutral
AMD,"Ddr5 is 2 sticks 4 channels, they were solving it before Ai became a thing,  edit to add: the real bottleneck is ram itself, it takes many cycles to store/read data from it.",Neutral
AMD,"It costs more for them to make for a niche market. They don't see an ROI for making a more costly and complex CPU, or they would have done it. It is a niche market.",Negative
AMD,"Because 95% of the market ain't got a need for it and they ain't gonna pay the extra, period.",Negative
AMD,"Because more channels implicitly come with much larger cost. You have basically hundreds of pins on each RAM, you need to have them also on the CPU - so the CPU have to come with ~200 additional connections - larger packaging, more DRAM controllers inside CPU - again additional cost, then you have much more complex connection routing on the motherboards - you need more layer PCBs. So if you would have 4 channels instead of 2, you would basically increase the cost on CPUs and Motherboards by a substantial amount, an most people would probably dont even use all those 4 channels, especially at the current prices of RAM. Also since DDR5 technically each stick have effectively 2 independent channels in them.",Neutral
AMD,> Since so many tasks nowadays are memory bottlenecked  no,Neutral
AMD,"GPUs are also instructive as to why not though, they are running highly parallelized and scalable workloads where memory bandwidth is the limiting factor; this is also why the AMD APUs scale so well with ram frequency  The average workload being put on the CPU/memory is random comparatively, you're more likely to encounter bottlenecks related to latency or capacity than the system bottlenecking because peak bandwidth is too low",Neutral
AMD,"DDR5 is 2 channels a stick. So 2 sticks 4 channels. The answer is cost. Ram takes a lot of pins because it's a parallel bus and they are hard to route because serpentine and high speeds. If you add more, it's going to cost more. Who is going to pay more?  And what memory bottleneck? Gigantic monolithic RAM consuming tasks are pretty rare. Except for AI... Most problems that can be solved with throwing more sticks of RAM at something can be solved the same or better by throwing more RAM attached to another CPU and you get clustering benefits. And for when it does make sense, you can orchestrate RAM channels per CPU but then use the CPU to CPU channels like on Xeons to sync memory and tasks. For example look at the old HP DL980s (I think) that had 4 Xeons in them with 160ish cores. Then each had a literal bucket of RAM. You loaded things into the RAM and CPU but if you needed more, CPU1 could use CPU2s RAM, just very slowly. So it did make lots of interesting use cases.",Neutral
AMD,i've been down this rabbit hole before. the short answer is cost and market segmentation - quad-channel adds pins and motherboard complexity that most consumers won't pay for. what helped me was looking at the [Corsair Dominator Titanium DDR5](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Corsair+Dominator+Titanium+DDR5&language=en_US&tag=bestdeals202f-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl) or [G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=G.Skill+Trident+Z5+RGB&language=en_US&tag=bestdeals202f-20&ref=as_li_ss_tl) which hit really high speeds on dual-channel. those kits can push 8000MHz+ which helps with bandwidth. also Intel's non-K chips lock memory overclocking which forces people to buy their higher-end stuff. AMD's been more flexible with memory on their AM5 platform. for serious bandwidth needs Threadripper exists but that's a whole different budget tier.,Neutral
AMD,"A lot of incorrect and incomplete answers.   The correct answer is we do. DDR5 has two channels per DIMM, one stick of DDR5 has the same bandwidth as two sticks of DDR4 (unless you have an 8gb stick, which only has one channel and is basically high latency DDR4). It's why memory controllers struggle with four sticks of DDR5, it's the same bandwidth as 8 sticks of DDR4. The architecture sacrificed some latency for double the bandwidth. It goes great with the high number of threads modern CPUs have.   It's why latency is also the big bottleneck now.",Neutral
AMD,Memory bandwidth isn't really a issue for most people. For home uses memory latency is important but its still pretty much fine ddr4 and ddr5 both have good enough latency that most people dont notice. For example their is a basically ps4 pc kit that uses the apu and memory with parts of it disabled that people could buy and while it works it kind of sucks for home applications even though it has about 450 GB/s bandwidth while ddr5 is normally at about 50 GB/s the much worse latency just ruins it for many applications. So most home uses dont really need more than 2 channels of memory and memory channels are really really expensive to build into the chip so its jot reallt worth it for quad or octa channel memory controllers for a chip that 99% of the time is gonna be paired with at most 2 sticks of ram but ia often just using 1. Like if we could only put 4GB of ram on a stick then maybe we would need the ability to put 8 sticks in for consumers.,Neutral
AMD,"I agree. Smartphones, handheld consoles, handheld PCs and standalone VR headsets are in desperate need of higher memory bandwidths. It would greatly help to have at least 280 GB/s for the whole SoC. Unfortunately, 75-110 GB/s for the whole SoC is definitely not enough. This is why Xbox One sucked so much, with its budget DDR3 memory (+very low number of TMUs and ROPs). It was awesome how much faster was the One X! I wish the OG One was already like One X in 2013!  RTX 5090 has really wide memory bandwidth and a substantial amount of memory, but it is very very costly unfortunately.  But also, memory bottleneck quite often really means too high memory latency, instead of too narrow bandwidth. Putting memory closer to the CPU/GPU/NPU definitely helps with latency.      Something is beginning to move in the right direction, because of AMD's Strix Halo, but that was 1 year ago. I've hoped for more devices using it. Intel's Panther Lake is having higher memory bandwidth than ever.",Positive
AMD,"how many consumer tasks scale with memory bandwidth so hard?  the general question is: do we have enough bandwidth to feet the max core chips on consumer platforms well enough?  and thus far that seems to still be true.  there is ONE task, that is EXTREMELY memory bandwidth limited though, which is apus on desktops.  so if amd would want to sell decent performing apus in a socketed desktop platform in the future, then 2 channels would be very limiting.  more likely however amd won't care about that and enjoy just selling higher performance apus with garbage soldered on and also non ecc memory instead.  and for all the rest we will see another bandwidth doubling with ddr6 coming with... am6 in many years though.  which should be good enough to feed things mostly, which would be 32 core at least zen8 chips.  32 core zen7 on am5 will be interesting however if there would be some bandwidth limitations in tasks happening then with just ddr5 and 2 channels.  \_\_\_  also the chipset doesn't matter. the chipset isn't part of the conversation literally. the cpu communicates directly with the memory. the chipset has no say in it. IN FACT you sell amd cpus without chipsets, as the i/o from the cpu is enough.  the thing, that they'd need to change is the io-die and the motherboards.  and io-dies are a lot cheaper to change than core chiplets, because they are on older nodes generally.  but yeah the one bandwidth issue, that exists is apus and they probably will just show us the middle finger anyways in that regard.",Neutral
AMD,"Well, I can’t say that I’m more knowledgeable but I believe you missed a few key points, there’s something as memory bus for 2 channels up to 12 channels, also when looking at SoC among the cores there is cache, memory bus(for Apple sheep unified memory), display engine, NPU and many other IP blocks, so it is all about configuration and use case(labeled for home, pro or corporate use).",Neutral
AMD,Even gamers aren’t bandwidth limited but latency so it’s sorta pointless even on the high end most of the time,Negative
AMD,"Yup.  People complain about the base storage options on Apple products too, ignoring who the majority customers are: people who don’t need it.  Apple sells bulk orders of base iPhones to corporations who use them as portable scanners, pos devices, etc. they install a singular app and lock it down so it only runs that app.  Not to mention all the people who literally install WhatsApp, Facebook and that’s it.  They don’t need 1TB of storage.   The only reason the base amount of storage, memory or memory bandwidth, cpu cores bumped up is because manufacturing changes. You can’t offer less without charging more because you’d need to keep manufacturing processes running for this use case. Cheaper to up the specs and use binned chips than to keep things exactly the same.  If there was an iPhone sold with 128GB storage, people would buy it. It’s just cheaper to set the iPhone 17 to 256GB and have a tighter supply chain and more volume on specific NAND chips.  People forget how basic so much technology usage actually is.",Negative
AMD,"Even if you don't use a webside/webapp moving on scales of ""you have some thousands of employees hired"" makes every hardware upgrade a careful consideration. For a dev job running Visual Studio on a 8-core CPU would be ideal, but usually even on a virtual machine every instance gets assigned 4 cores/8 threads. Having any SSD would do wonders for any kind of IT work due to fast responses, but even on VMs they use HDD for storage which is not ideal.  The cost of hardware when a signature means thousands of units it's harder than what most people thinks.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a threadripper (2950x) and while the increased channels and increased threads are theoretically nice to have they’re problematic for latency critical uses. The ram, CPUs, and pcie buses are bifurcated so there’s massive latency for anything having to cross over the infinity fabric. Games have massive micro stuttering and crashes, for example.   Intel has done hpc without bifurcation but it cost much more money for the same performance and needed almost 2x the power.   The other problem with quad channel memory is that quad channel kits are inflated. You have to roll the dice and hope two dual channel kits work well.  The threadripper is relegated to the home lab.",Negative
AMD,"No, it's the opposite. It generally gets harder to keep stable clocks / tight timings as you add channels and DIMMs.   Memory latency has been the major bottleneck since the dawn of computing, but bandwidth can help you hide some of it.",Negative

I _wish_ the dual compute tile part would have a dual channel IMC directly in each compute tile for quad channel total, relatively like what they’re doing with Granite Rapids or AMD did with Threadripper before they adopted the IO die, _but_ every leak/rumor has been pretty unanimous that’s not the plan.

AMD,"A single burst of transfers on one memory channel is enough to fetch a whole cache line.

AMD,"The top-end platforms right now are running 12 channels of ddr5-8800. Speed and width aren't a direct tradeoff. You can have both.   What tends to hurt speeds is the number dimms per channel.

AMD,"It's not like that for this kind of work: it's employee QoL but doesn't translate in huge productivity increases. Most office work isn't heavy computing where the time a program takes to finish is limiting all the time the production. In those cases they buy tha hardware for the task.  It is bursts and the difference is solving eventual bursts with less ms of time: it's mostly about system snappiness or fast responses, but that doesn't mean the worker will finish equally fast. That's also why virtual machines are an acceptable working environment despite there's no way around network latency and tricks the connection programs do to keep bandwidth low. Programming is also a lot more about thinking/reading than typing and doing stuff.  Before even SSD were a thing people would keep everything open all the time just in case they needed, because it would take several seconds to re-open if needed later. You can put an SSD and the person now opens/closes programs as needed because opening them is not longer a huge time sink.  Other problems like compilation time are solved by giving compilers the ability to compile portions of the code base and reusing what's already compiled and didn't change. Or compiling less times.

I suggest the 7800X3D 9800X3D or 9850X3D if just for gaming . While thr 9950X3D is their top of line twin 8 core CPU making it full 16 cores . Essentially two 9800X3D's of power for both gaming and work that requires multi core performance.    Hope I educated you a tiny bit more. And figure out your purchase needs . If i got something wrong  apologies . But It's probably not farr off . And I did own real world last gen 9 series . Vs a new gen 7 series X3D. And gaming it's a monster.  That sips power like a newborn trying moonshine. Hardly using may power at all 120watts . 5.5 ghz top speed boost matching my 7900x 5.5 ghz across 12 cores at 165watts.   And it still benches higher then the 9 series of last gen too . They are just built well . Built smart . And sometimes yes less complicated produces better results .my 7 series 9800X3D does not bottleneck on a 5090 . So your 9070XT  . Im thinking the 5900X3D for you will work like a charm . But you also work.. so 7 or 9 series will help your multi thread performance .   But not your gaming FPS . Thr 5900X3D probably give you the same FPS with your 9070XT as a 9900X or X3D   Best of lluck and remember people often buy overkill and wind up scrolling tik tok with a 5 grand PC . After the first month.",Neutral
AMD,Is the 9950x3d in reach for you?,Neutral
AMD,Seconded here. 9850x3D is currently the best gaming chip on the market.,Positive
AMD,If you are gaming at 1440p (which you probably should with a 9070XT) then a 7600X should be fine but I could see it having issues at 1080p. A monitor would probably be the better choice for an upgrade though. Productivity work could also make a CPU upgrade desirable.,Neutral
AMD,It's pretty slow for some of the programs I'm using that are fairly CPU intensive. It was an open box from Newegg and it was fine at first but it feels like it's losing performance. Chances are I got a bad chip that somebody else returned. I'm beginning more and more kernel panics Even though I don't have anything overclocked and all my temps are good.   I paid $70 for the CPU and Newegg is willing to give me$120 for it. I'll eventually get a better GPU but with how things are right now It's the best 16 GB card I could afford.  CPUs seem to be kind of cheap right now so I want to get the best I can afford so $400-500   This is my first AMD system and I've done a bit of research on the hardware originally but It seemed weird that the 9900X3D  while supposedly being a higher spec was the same price new and cheaper than the 9850X3D used.   I didn't realize the 9900 operated like that. I'm guessing some games and programs can actually take advantage of it which would explain why when I looked at benchmarks and stuff it was like a 50/50 whether it would be worse or better.,Negative
AMD,"Exactly what I was thinking as well, I'm using a Ryzen 7 5800X with a RX 9070 XT with no problems at all in 1440p gaming. If there is a problem, it's with my monitor that only goes up to 180Hz, will replace that down the line.",Neutral
AMD,What's the deal with the 9900? I was looking at benchmarks and there's some random games where it does amazing but most of the time it sucks? Is it something inherent to its design or something that updates and optimization later on the road might let games actually benefit from?  I'll eventually get a better GPU (If The AI bubble pops) but I managed to snag the 9060 16 GB for MSRP a couple weeks ago.  My productivity stuff does absolutely hammer the CPU but I can obviously just go do something else while it works so it's Not the biggest deal in the world.   That said the CPU doesn't seem to be performing as well as it should on paper.  Whether that's a quirk of my build or the open box CPU has something wrong with it. My TV is 240 hertz but If I drop it down to 1080p I only get like 130 on games like Warframe while my GPU isn't struggling.,Negative
AMD,"If you are buying the microcenter bundle, the 9850x3d is only $20 better than the 9800x3d and comes with a better motherboard.  Seems like the better choice even if it is just a refresh.",Positive
AMD,I thought the X3D line was all meant for gaming. Some other people commented about the 6 + 6 setup. I guess most games right now can't take advantage of the 12 cores? But nobody has explained if that's a Not right now or games never will take advantage of them issue.   The 7800x3d is only slightly cheaper and the rest are All within like $30 of each other right now.,Neutral
AMD,The 9950x3D is on par and very occasionally slightly worse than a 9800x3D in gaming. It's not really worth it for gaming only builds.,Negative
AMD,"Going through the replies I think you're the first one to actually mention that half of the 9900 doesn't have X3D cash.  Other people mention that it was a 6x6 configuration but I thought it might be a software optimization issue.   I guess that puts the 9900 squarely out of the running  The 9950X3D is the obvious choice but being almost $200 more is out of the budget.   The 9800X3D, 9850X3D and 9900X3D are all within $30 of each other right now. The 9900 is obviously out but Is there any weirdness between the 98xxX3D's or is the 9850 for $20 more the obvious choice over the 9800 .",Neutral
AMD,Hardware Canucks also has a 9070 XT scaling video.  It’s at 1440p but OP does not mention games or resolutions so we’re just taking their word that it’s a CPU bottleneck.,Neutral
AMD,I wish I'd gotten a better CPU from the start but Alas I spent all my money on RAM and VRAM. In all seriousness think I got a bunk CPU. It was open box and is slightly unstable. I thought it was my motherboard at first and got it swapped out and everything was good for like a month but now I'm getting kernel panics again and the 7600 isn't overclock or anything.  Also while it technically works when I benchmark it doesn't perform as well as it should.  I've checked it out pretty thoroughly and I'm confident it's legit I think it just lost the silicon lottery. So I will happily trade it in for almost twice what I paid for it.,Negative
AMD,"Your comment is super thorough. Yet somehow on the bottom. Others have mentioned the weird 6x6 nature of the 9900 and how only half of it has access to the 3D vcash.  The 9950X3D is 100%  what I should get but it's out of my price range.   I'll upgrade my GPU later but getting a 16 GB 9060 for MSRP right now felt like a great deal.   Looking at benchmarks it's really not clear if the 9850X3D is truly better than the 9800X3D. On benchmarks it's sort of random which one does better. Is It possible the 9850 Will get better with software and optimizations or is it just something about the way it's built?   If the 9850 is clearly better but just not optimized yet I assume it's worth an extra $20 over the 9800, right?",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no. The 9800,9850, and 9900 are all $10 apart though And I want to make the right choice for my use case. I almost got the 9900 because number big price cheap on impulse But I'm glad I asked Reddit. The 9950X3D is 100% the best choice for my use case but it's almost $200 more than the other three choices and I can't really justify that right now with the new launches coming up so soon.",Negative
AMD,I don’t understand this. Why would cpu that can handle higher resolutions have issues at Lower resolutions?,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, It's hooked up to my living room TV so 4K 240hrz with FreeSync. I'm normally using it at 4K when doing productivity work with a frame rate doesn't really matter like 3D modeling or creating toolpaths for CNC stuff. My work IS CPU bound but I also think my open box Newegg CPU is a dud and It's not performing as well as it should have.   For gaming I turn the resolution down to 1440 for most things but to 1080p for FPS's and the CPU is the bottleneck.   On paper should have been fine but it's not and Newegg is willing to almost double what I paid for it as a trade in so I want to get something that'll keep up with whatever my next GPU is.  It does seem like once you get to the $500 range You're drowning in options and The specs are all very similar but how they actually perform is somehow vastly different.   Looking at the two I mentioned they're very close on paper but on benchmarks the 9900 absolutely stomps the other one in productivity related stuff but also randomly some games. So it's not super clear If it's just optimization problems and games not taking advantage of the 9900's extra cores or if they actually can't for some hardware reason.   I'd love a better GPU but that ain't happening right now  I didn't luck out and get 128gb of DDR5 6400 well below MSRP right before the AI kick the bucket down on us so it's not all bad.",Neutral
AMD,"It's sort of an inherent trouble coupled with modern game design and a little bit of scheduling weirdness. Basically, a lot of current gen games want 8 cores and 8-16 threads, which tends to leave the 6+6 getting a little funky as if Core 0 wants something from Core 7 it has to get it across the infinity fabric. With the X3D, it actually ends up being the reverse case, where the first 6 cores have all of the cache (by a lot!) and so the other 2-6 need to go ask politely for data.  The 7600X you currently have is most likely suffering from this to some extent as well, in that a lot of games could really use the 2 cores it's missing; still faster than the console setup, but the highest framerate target on the consoles is 120... Which more or less tracks with you running out of CPU around 130, actually.   Glancing at Newegg, seeing that you're currently on a fairly limited GPU, I'd probably lean toward the 9800X3D and pizza for dinner. The 9850X3D is technically better, and I'd go for it 100% of the time on an all-new build where you're buying another $1000 of other stuff so the $40 gap is absolutely just noise, but since you're dropping a chip into an otherwise existing system it makes sense to have the pizza.",Neutral
AMD,It’s how they got me. $20 for 5% lifetime performance increase? Done.,Neutral
AMD,"9900x3d and 9950x3d will turn off half of the cores when gaming. You will end up with a 9600x3d and a 9800x3d respectively. Those CPUs are essentially made of 2 sets of cpu cores (called ccd's) that communicate with each other through interfaces (AMD brand it as infinity fabric).  Intercore communication within a ccd is about 10-20 ns. Inter-ccd communication is about 100-200 ns. You get the idea. With high thread workloads where latency doesn't matter, you get lots of threads and cores. In gaming where latency does matter, communication across the cores gets bottlenecked by the interface and you get frame drops. That's why AMD drivers and Windows will disable half of the cores to avoid frame drops when you play a game.  That's why if you focus on gaming, you always get single ccd chips like the 7800x3d or 9800x3d.   If you want to game and work which is what your build is planning to do, then get a 9950x3d. It's expensive and wasteful as hell as you literally turn off half of the cpu when gaming, but it's not a compromised experience compared to a 9900x3d.",Neutral
AMD,"True, however OP also does CAD work",Neutral
AMD,"The 9850x3d is just a bit faster than the 9800x3d.   The 9850x3d  appears to be simply a better binned 9800x3d.   Meaning a chip that can sustain higher clock speeds than the ""average"" 9800x3d.     If it were me, I'd spend the extra $20 for the 9850x3d,  just to have bragging rights until the Zen6 cpu's launch.  In practical terms the 9800x3d and the 9850x3d are equivalent.  If 1 to 3% more performance is worth the $20, or bragging is fun, get the 9850x3d.   With either chip, you're getting a strong cpu!  I pointed out that the 9900x3d had vcache on only half the cores because others hadn't mentioned it and it is important.  If you want confirmation of your passing on the 9900x3d,  this is a good video to watch: https://youtu.be/kH6JGU7ZrWM?si=pbSM4VI04dXaq4uQ  The title says it all!",Positive
AMD,"Yeah that's my bad. But it kind of just depends on the game. The Witcher or Skyrim are fine at 4K, I might play Warframe cyberpunk at 1440 and COD or battlefield at 1080 I might even try to play helldivers at 480 because God doesn't hate my CPU.   That said I think there's an issue with my CPU because it's not performing as well as it should have. It's an open box from Newegg and It did okay but I also had some weird issues and got my motherboard swapped out but now thinking maybe it was this CPU all along. It works but the boy ain't right.   I'll upgrade my GPU when VRAM cost less than organs again but from what others have said the 9900 doesn't make sense for my use case and the 9950 called me poor and insulted my heritage so it's out.  the real question is 9800 or spend $20 more for the 9850?",Negative
AMD,"Honestly? You just need to find out how intensive your productivity tasks are, and see if the 9800x3d will manage those tasks fine. Otherwise get the 9900x3d.  If  the 9800x3d is your choice and the 9850x3d isnt much more (im talking below 50 usd), you may aswell get it purely to have the best gaming cpu.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, I think /u/CaptainPigtails worded this poorly. It's not that the CPU would perform any worse at 1080p than it would at 1440. What I believe they are trying to say is that at 1440p, the limiting component would be the GPU. But, at 1080p, the CPU might not be able to feed frames to the GPU as fast as the GPU can render them.",Negative
AMD,"Because as the resolution goes down the performance impact on the GPU decreases, leading to scenarios where the GPU is waiting for the CPU to finish its job. This doesn't mean you'll get less frames then you would at 1440p, it means you won't get as many frames as someone with the same graphics card and a better processor at 1080p.",Neutral
AMD,"> My work IS CPU bound  If you use your PC for working, then you'll want a CPU with more cores.   Like a 7950 or 9950X3D.   You get the best of both worlds.... a CPU that do all the productivity tasks you can throw at it, while still being one of the best CPU's you can have for when you're gaming.   A 9900, in gaming, operates like any other 6-core Ryzen CPU. Because its 2x 6-core CPUs.  7950 & 9950 have 2x 8-core dies. And with X3D, they will use core-parking so that only the X3D die will be used when gaming, putting all other tasks on the non-cache die.",Positive
AMD,The 7600x Should have been a massive upgrade over the I-5 8700K overclocked to 5GZ I was running before but for productivity I think the old I5 was faster and for gaming the 7600 is faster but also way less stable.   Switching to AM5 I threw most of my money at RAM (Good thing too because I beat the price hikes) and got a really good deal with for the mobo and 7600 but It's not the improvement I was expecting considering how much time there is between the I5 8700k and the 7600.  Also wasn't really expecting to get back into PC gaming or I probably would have sprung for an X3D model and probably would have been fine.   But hey if new egg wants to give me $120 for what was a 50-60 CPU in the bundle I might as well spring for something top of the line and be 100% sure this time.   There's a rebate on the 9850 so the difference is $10... I'd have to go to Little Caesars if I wanted pizza for that.   The 9800 and the 9850 benchmarks are super inconsistent. With a 9850 being slower like 60% of the time. The real question is is that part of the hardware or is a software issue.   Also It's hard to find any info on people's benchmarking for productivity but It almost seems like when operating on half of the cores for something like gaming The 9800 wins but when using all cores the 9850 wins. If it's something consistent in the design maybe letting all the cores share the 3D cache on the 9850 more efficiently on productivity tasks that would probably be the better choice for me but If it just software randomness I should probably go with a 9800.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I think I am gonna do a comp upgrade soon, my 3600 is showing its age, but am also trying to wait things out (if that is even possible.  If I were to do an upgrade today it would be for the 9850x3D microcenter bundle myself.",Neutral
AMD,I assume the 9800 Will turn off half of its course the same way as a 9850. Looking at benchmarks between the two it's kind of all over the place. What's the difference? I assume the 9850 is newer and maybe with updates might consistently I perform the 9800 but right now it's nearly 50/50. The 9850 is only $20 more right now so I should probably just get it but I'm curious what the difference is.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh I forgot about that 😅, yeah you're right a 9950x3D is the best for OP.",Positive
AMD,It's kind of frustrating. If they'd made it 8x4 It would have been perfect  for what I'm doing. Just looking at data I didn't see anything about half the core is not having access to it and thought maybe It was the games just not taking advantage of the extra cores the same way the threadripper didn't really do great when it first came out.  I'll probably wind up with the 9850 but I'm curious if anybody knows why The 9850 isn't consistently a little better and why in some games the 9800 scorches it instead of it almost always being 50/50 with the 9850 occasionally being better instead of equal.   I haven't said anything to confirm but it almost seems like the 9850 distributed work more effectively but maybe there are some games that are harder on the first six or seven cores and the 9800 runs better when the workload isn't even.  If that's the case the 9800 would be the better gaming CPU and The 9850 would be my choice hands down since My CAD program It's pretty good about slamming all the cores evenly.   My 7600 is weird especially on productivity stuff. I don't really know how to monitor it close enough to tell but it almost feels like sometimes something goes wrong and it doesn't actually engage all of its cores. I can send something to slice and it'll take 3 minutes and I'll Go back to double check something and send the same exact thing to slice again without editing and it'll take like six or seven minutes the second time. It's just super inconsistent and while yes it is slower than I'd like for gaming it's like sometimes when I'm at 1080p for the CPU just skips. Nothing normal hitching I get out of a GPU that's running out of VRAM but like the CPU thermal throttles for a split second. Honestly I think I lost a silicon lottery and this 7600 should have got binned lower.    For gaming I'd rather have a locked 60 than then a 130 average with 40 frams 1% low,Negative
AMD,"I mean, that seems more like a busted chip, cooling issues or some broken settings or boost behavior than it being slow.  I had no issues on Cyberstan D10s with a 9070 XT at 1440 UW and a worse CPU (5800X).",Negative
AMD,I suppose I'll spend the $10 to get the 9850 over the 9800. I have no trust for AMD's naming scheme anymore though.,Negative
AMD,Understood thank you,Positive
AMD,"Well, an 8700K actually using the K part of its name is... Pretty much the 7600X in a lot of regards. Against a 5ghz 8700K, you'd be looking at like... 15-20% if that in benefit.   Meanwhile the X3D stuff gets you 33% more cores *and* same or better clock speeds *and* the cache benefit, so it'll be a much larger change than the sort of side-grade you already went through.   I haven't actually seen the 9850X3D wind up *slower* than the 9800X3D, just... Not really any faster. Something like 6% average or something, which more or less tracks with what actually changed (it's a 9800X3D but clocked higher). Similar for the productivity side, the 9850X3D does run itself a bit harder at default under all-core but you can get a large part of that pretty easily from the 9800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,">I assume the 9800 Will turn off half of its course the same way as a 9850  No thats not how that works.    A 9800X3D is a single 8core CPU die.   9850X3D is just an overclocked, better binned 9800X3D. There is no difference other than having a 200Mhz higher boost clock. 5.4Ghz vs 5.6Ghz.  These single CCD CPUs do not have core-parking",Negative
AMD,"It is still quite likely the 9800x3d or 9850x3d will suffice for OP's needs.  I was just pointing out that the 9950x3d would excel at both gaming and productivity, if he wanted both.",Positive
AMD,"lol honestly it took me ages to learn names for different cpus, im still clueless towards intel cpus  Goodluck with the build",Neutral
AMD,I think part of the reason it feels like such a side step moving to the 7600xt It's because the one I got seems really unstable Even at its normal clock speed. I can't overclock it at all and it seems to Hitch when pushed hard in gaming. I went from 95 FPS to 130 FPS average but my 1% lows went from 85 down to almost 40.   I think the unstableness is what makes it feel so bad to use.  For gaming my GPU seems like a side step too I went from a RX590 Sapphire that overclocked extremely well to a 9060 sapphire that doesn't really overclock. For productivity like 3D modeling doubling the VRAM made a massive difference and honestly I could use a graphics card that had more than 16 GB but It's such a weird combo in the 9060 because in gaming it's not really powerful enough to need 16GB or at least not that I've seen so far.  As a gaming card I think the 9060 would have been better off with 12 GB of RAM but It's great for productivity so I'm happy with it even if It's barely better for gaming.,Negative
AMD,But alas I am poor.,Negative
AMD,But mighty in spirit!  You're blessed enough to be able to have a pc with powerful cpu's.   That is wealth!,Positive
AMD,My buddy is the one who is really blessed. The 7600 feels like a lateral move sideways instead of an upgrade over my old I5  8600K that was overclocked to 5GZ.  The 9070xt is a boost but not as much as I expected at 4k.  I gave my old system to my best friend and he slapped a RX580 under the overclocked RX590 and downloaded lossless scaling and frame gen and we are putting out almost the same numbers. Except I gave him that one then spent all this money upgrading to AM5 to have nearly the same performance.,Positive

AMD,"I don’t really plan to make a big budge movement - in fact, a couple of years ago I was using literally a previous generation build (DDR 3...) so I am really only looking to replace the GPU for the time being.

Yes, I looked it up, and the 1660 is defenitively a step above my RX570. It actually seems to be an almost perfect matchup for my Ryzen 3 3100- the RX570 was seemingly holding it back a tad. That’s really what I need, just a nice little upgrade but within my current build, since to go even further, I would have to start checking to upgrade the CPU as well as you said and yeah, havent got the budget for that atm.  rx 6600 is also clearly better, but just a tiny bit pricey for my tastes.

AMD,"The 5700 is pretty much just the 5500 but with two more cores. I would suggest instead getting either the 5600, 5600X, or 5600XT, whichever is cheapest. If you really want 8 cores, get either the 5700X, 5800X, or 5800XT, again whichever is cheapest. Do not get the 5700 (non-X).",Neutral
AMD,"The 5700x shouldn't be €250, but around €150.",Neutral
AMD,"Get a 5600 non X it's the same as 5800X in games, tested myself",Neutral
AMD,"if you don't want to spend extra for x version DO NOT BUY 5700, buy 5600 instead, 5700 only has half of the cache, it's a scam it performs worse in games than a cpu tier lower",Negative
AMD,"No, performance will be similar. Only real significant upgrade for AM4 is the x3D chips, but they are a much higher price tag",Neutral
AMD,I was looking at Ryzen 5 5600XT but woudn't 6 cores be the problem for near future games that coming in 2026-2028,Neutral
AMD,Just regular use and some gaming i just want faster PC and some headroom im still running first Zen 6 core,Neutral
AMD,Also not to mention ryzen 7 5700 non x it only supports pcie gen 3 not pcie gen 4 while the x version supports it,Neutral
AMD,The 5700 is based on cezanne which has halved L3 cache. For gaming the x is substantially better.,Positive
AMD,"Wrong, the 5700 has half the cache and is on a different architecture compared.to the 5700x. There can be a difference of up to 25% in a gaming environment.",Negative
AMD,The 5700 is a scam cpu. Its extra cores are irrelevant because it’s a gimped product.,Negative
AMD,"5600xt is also good. No it won't be a problem, most games do not profit from extra cores but still rely on fast, single cores.",Positive
AMD,"I mean the Zen 3 architecture would be a bigger issue than core count for future games...I still remember people hyped up Zen 1 because 8 cores is the future and those CPUs became obsolete before 8 cores are mandatory in games....  Also, the standard 5600 is fine, X is a rip-off for factory OC and the XT is an even bigger rip-off",Negative
AMD,"While old a 3700X or 9600K is still serviceable in most games today, more cores don't mean more better.      Even the 2700X will get you by, although it is showing it's age.",Neutral
AMD,No. 6 cores are perfectly fine and will be for the next few years. Games benefit from better architecture higher speeds and more cache . As long as you have 6+ cores you are fine   Here is a 2026 revisit of 5xxx cpus. 5600x is only 2-3% slower than 5700x/5800x   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijAyVshtok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RijAyVshtok)  And yes 5700x is worth it over 5700,Positive
AMD,For gaming 5700x is better.,Positive
AMD,How is your CPU lacking? What issues are you experiencing? What difference are you hoping an upgrade will make?  Worth it for most people means spending hundreds of dollars will make a noticeable difference to them. This is subjective and situational.,Neutral
AMD,"Micro Center or New Egg bundles are available with some great (all things considered) deals.  If you are upgrading platforms, I would go the bundle route.",Positive
AMD,"Do you reliably hit the fps of your monitor?      If yes, then there's no need to upgrade.      If no, then you can look at upgrading your system.      I currently run a 5070TI with a 5800x and I consistently stay at 144 fps without any dips at 1440p. I have my games capped at 144.",Neutral
AMD,"Honestly, I see little point in upgrading, unless you are seeing a major deficiency in your FPS performance.  Switching to AM5 means you will need a new CPU, motherboard, and RAM.... and RAM prices right now are crazy.  If you still want to upgrade, you might want to consider going for a Ryzen 5800X3D.  That way, you can get a meaningful boost in FPS performance in some games, and go from 6 cores/12 threads on your Ryzen 5600X to 8 cores/16 threads on the Ryzen 5800X3D, without needing to replace your existing motherboard or DD4 memory. It would be a much cheaper upgrade compared to switching to AM5.",Neutral
AMD,I'd just keep going with what you currently have. Why do you want to upgrade?,Neutral
AMD,"Absolutely do not upgrade unless you are extremely rich. Giving up on a good CPU, 32 GB DDR4 RAM which is already very expensive and an entire motherboard is not worth it in any way sort or form. If the CPU is not good enough for you then consider getting a Ryzen 9 5900X or 5950X or similar.",Negative
AMD,"I wouldn't upgrade, your AM4 build is still strong.",Positive
AMD,"I started with your specs 5 years ago except for a different GPU and stuck with AM4, but I’ve swapped out for a 5800X3D and upped to 64GB of RAM.  I have no plans to get into AM5 now that AM6 is on the horizon and everything is overpriced these days.  5600X is a great processor that overlocks decently well.",Negative
AMD,"Depends what you are trying to achieve. An example, I upgraded from a 5800X3D to 9800X3D. I game at 1440p 240Hz and 4k 120Hz. Trying to push 240fps for 240Hz in games like BO7 & BF6 the upgrade was absolutely worth it. However, when aiming for 120fps for 120Hz it would not be worth it all.",Neutral
AMD,"The 5600X is still pretty good, and with current prices I would try to hold onto it for as long as you can.  The only downside is the 6-cores but that may also be fine. You could look at buying a used 5700X or 5800X or similar and then selling your 5600X. Depends on used market conditions in your area.",Positive
AMD,"Maybe price out a 5950x CPU and an adequate cooler to go with it  Otherwise  Any 7000 series CPU + a decent cooler  Look for ""open box"" B650 motherboards from Newegg  DDR 5 RAM is going to be the item that hurts your pocketbook the most",Neutral
AMD,"5800X3D could be your solution if you are on tight with money, but its hard to get. And only used one, amd stopped production year or two ago.  Otherwise am5 and 7800x3d..but prices of RAMs arent in your favor. Im sorry.",Negative
AMD,"Biggest thing for me is the CPU for editing and playing games (star citizen, etc) just window shopping right now and looking for suggestions on what would be a good build for Amd 5 where I can just sit there for years like I have with Amd 4.",Neutral
AMD,"I have looked into the 5800x3D but they don't make them anymore and they are hard to come by, even tried to get one from GameStop. Honestly I'm fine with waiting for a few more years to get AMD 5 but I want a build that I can work towards while I wait for the market to settle down, if that makes sense?",Negative
AMD,"A better CPU, but I'm just looking for suggestions on a build, not that I am building it right this second, but just for the future",Neutral
AMD,"Noted, thanks for your comment, I'm not rich unfortunately, so it's window shopping until then, I'll definitely take a look at those CPUs.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes not yet, but window shopping for when the market finally calms down, I wanna have something thought out before then.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah I agree, if the 5800X3D was produced still and easier to come by then I wouldn't have any issues upgrading to it, not to say my current build is horrible but I do want to know what I have to work towards in upgrading to AMD 5, especially after the market calms down and the Amd 5 builds look cheaper.",Neutral
AMD,"I play on 1440p and my system works, I even do editing, but my CPU is the weakest link and I wouldn't mind knowing what I have to do in order to upgrade to AMD 5 with a good CPU that works with my current GPU, for the future because the market these days is putting me off on making the leap from Amd 4",Neutral
AMD,"Thanks for the suggestion, I plan on waiting a bit for the prices to go down, so I'm just getting the build idea together until then.",Positive
AMD,"Yeah I tried to get the 5800X3D, wish they still made them, but as far as the Amd 5  goes, I'm just looking for a build suggestion for the future, something to work towards for when the market finally stops being how it is.",Negative
AMD,"I mean, if a 5600X has been fine for you, then I would assume 7600X would be fine as well, or any CPU above that. It entirely depends on what you want and your opinion on the resulting performance.   You can use benchmarks to compare expected performance in various workloads, then decide for yourself if that difference is worth your money. It's ultimately your opinion, rather than anything objective or factual.",Neutral
AMD,"If you are looking to upgrade in a few years, then I would suggest waiting for Zen 6 to come out, which is slated for 2027.",Neutral
AMD,A 7800X3D would be a big upgrade.,Neutral
AMD,"Nice. Those two specific CPUs are not mandatory at all, but they are very good. I can also recommend the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, as long as it’s AM4 lol!",Positive
AMD,Does your cpu actually prevent you from achieving the fps you want? If I had 1440p 144-165Hz and therefore a 144-165 fps target the upgrade I did wouldn’t have benefited me. What is it specifically you want your system to do better? Generally upgrades only feel beneficial when a component is actually lacking for your needs.,Neutral
AMD,"Appreciate it, yeah hopefully the market calms down eventually, till then, it's window shopping at this point.",Positive
AMD,"Dang, 6 is already coming out that soon? That's great news, hopefully the prices of Amd 5 will seriously go down, because all I can do in the mean time is wait.",Positive
AMD,"Oh yeah, hopefully big enough to last me until Amd 7 or Amd 8 haha, but gotta wait for the market to settle down",Positive
AMD,I wish I could get my hands on a 5800X3D haha,Positive
AMD,"It's a bottle neck on some stuff like editing or gaming, like star citizen or any CPU intensive games, it's not an upgrade I need right now because it doesn't prevent me from doing those activities, but I want to know what would be a good build for Amd 5 in which I can just sit there for years until something else needs upgrading, in the future",Negative
AMD,"I have two Zen 2 systems (Ryzen 3600 and Ryzen 3900 non-X) and one Zen 3 system (Ryzen 5600X).  I am holding off on replacing my existing PCs until Zen 6 comes out.  It is only a year or so away, so I figure it does not make sense getting Zen 5 nowadays.",Neutral
AMD,"Why is that? 5800X/XT is also a good alternative, otherwise the only ones I’d consider are the R9 5900X/5950X or the 5800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah especially with the AI bubble that makes everything expensive, one day hopefully",Negative
AMD,7500x3d is an excellent CPU for more budget.,Neutral
AMD,"your call, is the 50-110 Euro difference matter to you?  All 3 will perform about the same (10% margin) when paired with an RX7800XT in a lot of titles",Neutral
AMD,"If you can afford the extra €50, then get the 7800X3D. It's not a huge deal so don't worry about it too much.",Neutral
AMD,"Depends, is it just gaming or are you also doing something else like streaming or editing, etc? 7600X3D is fine for just gaming, but for something like streaming or editing I would suggest going for the 7800X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"I think you made your decision OP, but IMO, the 110 is worth it and while it’s a decent amount of money, over the life of this PC, it’s just pennies a day. I mean, even if you just amortize it over one year, it’s less than $10 a month.",Positive
AMD,What are the actual prices?  I’m amazed it’s only a 50Euro difference between the 2,Negative
AMD,"Idk why people are downplaying how amazing the 7800X3D is. I'd absolutely spend the extra 50 for the future proofing alone, aside from the fantastic performance. Will pair great with any future GPU upgrade as well. Also definitely invest in a 1440p monitor! what a difference it makes :)",Positive
AMD,"Don't get the 7600X3D, it's too close with the 7800X3D. Go for the 7500X3D or the 7800X3D. The latter for longevity if you plan to upgrade the GPU and monitor in the future, the former if you're happy to stay with your current GPU and monitor set up long term.",Neutral
AMD,Sadly the guy which provides me the mainboard/fan doesnt have that. Ill order it on my own,Negative
AMD,"I mean 110€ does matter, but since the place Im getting the cpu from only has the 7600, it would be a 50€ jump.  It's still money, but at the end of the day after buying ram + gpu + new case,  the 50€ more wont hurt too much.",Neutral
AMD,Maybe I'm overthinking it a bit hahah,Neutral
AMD,"I wanted to stream aswell, thats why I'm upgrading from AM4.",Neutral
AMD,"Haha, I wanted to upgrade my pc a tiny bit, but ended up with 1.2k.  Now I'm also thinking about upgrading my gpu, which I just did 2 months ago.  But yea Ill see if they can give me a little better deal and get the 7800 then",Neutral
AMD,250 vs 300.,Neutral
AMD,"Alright, thanks :)",Positive
AMD,"I just bought the gpu aswell. But maybe your right, I could sell it in the future and get an 9070 xt.  Problem is it's either getting the 7600 or 7800 there, since they dont have the 7500  or buy the parts myself and build it.",Neutral
AMD,well if this is an all in one deal thing then the 7600x3d will be fine,Neutral
AMD,"Having a budget is perfectly fine, but if the bottom line isn't set in stone dont miss a sweet bump for a few extra bucks.  I'd spend the 50, but the gains arnt insane so if 50 is more important dont sweat saving it either.",Neutral
AMD,"Get the 7800X3D then, those extra two cores will make streaming a lot better",Positive
AMD,"Haha, I get it. To be honest, you’ll just be happier with the 7800x3d. Not that it’ll destroy the 7600x3d or anything like that, but more about dealing with FOMO and buyer’s regret. You’ll be happy you just bit the bullet the first time. Buy once, cry once.",Positive
AMD,"Understood.  This is about $350 USD which is pretty good do the 7800x3d. We have a microcenter in certain parts of the states that have 7600x3d bundles, even where the cost of the CPU comes out to 170Euros.",Positive
AMD,"Sorry, the 7600 and the 7800\*  He only doesn't have the 7500",Negative
AMD,"Ill do it, thanks",Positive
AMD,Haha thats true.,Positive
AMD,"Heard a lot about microcenter, we dont have that here so Im buying a premade 7800X3D Bundle off a guy.",Neutral
AMD,"going back to my first question, is 50 Euros a good tradeoff the the futureproofing?. The 7800x3d is a top 5 tier gaming CPU that can easily handle a 5090.",Neutral
AMD,50€ is ait  Ill get the 7800x3d then I think,Neutral
AMD,3060 12gb? Probably wouldn't waste your time unless you have the cash for an RX 9070 at $630 and playing at 1440p or higher res. 9060xt 16gb is horrendous value at $440+ now.,Negative
AMD,"We spec a GPU based on budget, games, resolution, and other personal preferences. We do not spec a GPU soley based on CPU.  Can you provide more context?",Neutral
AMD,"Any particular games you care about? At what kinda settings?   Got an idea of budget range?  Best would be 5090 / sometimes 7900XTX/9070XT same as they are for any other CPU, but you're presumably not looking to spend that much.",Neutral
AMD,"I have the same cpu and mobo with 32gb ddr4 ram and I’m using a xfx rx6800 for 1440p gaming, like you resolution isn’t my priority. It’s a solid setup that can still play almost all AAA games without a problem",Neutral
AMD,"Forget the CPU. Just buy the best card you can with your budget, because you're probably going to upgrade the CPU at some point down the line too.",Positive
AMD,9060xt 16gb. It’s the best thing you’re getting for that price.,Positive
AMD,I have a 9060XT that I bought just after Christmas. Runs amazing with my 5600.  Running games at 1440 max settings,Positive
AMD,"I have a 5600x, 32GB DDR4, and a Asus 3070. At 1440p I can play most things at medium-high settings no problem, the VRAM can be an issue for higher texture settings though.",Positive
AMD,I have this cpu and using rx 9070,Neutral
AMD,Una RX 9060xt 16gb,Neutral
AMD,"I just upgraded my PC from a Ryzen 5 3600 to a Ryzen 5 7600 and went from a 3060 to a 5060Ti. The 5060ti (16gb) was $350 back in December and it's running everything I play (AR, BF6, Dune, BG3) absolutely beautifully at 1440. The difference is significant for me but some of that leap is probably the CPU too.",Positive
AMD,"I've been running a 5600X and 6750XT since July 2023, playing single player games at 1440p.  If buying today I'd look to the 9060XT 16GB, or a 9070 non XT.  For recent games like Borderlands 4, I rely on both FSR and framegen to get acceptable framerates.",Neutral
AMD,"If you're willing to buy used, RX 6800XT or RTX 3080Ti are around the $250-$350 USD range",Neutral
AMD,"The sky honestly the limit. I paired a 3600 with a 4070 Ti Super & a 1440p monitor and it was fantastic - I'd consider that about a tier down from a 5600. There were some games in existence that it couldn't run sufficiently, but the 5600 is a bit more powerful and that should not be an issue.   The lowest I'd probably go is a 9060 XT 16GB.",Positive
AMD,"Given the budget, I think 5070 12gb would be a fantastic upgrade. Going much higher may start having some CPU bottleneck problems.",Positive
AMD,"Your 3060 sounds fine, otherwise I would look at a 5060Ti if you really want to do an upgrade while maintaining a lower budget. If you can swing to a 9070 you’d be rocking at 1080 or 1440 and 1440 will put much more load on your GPU than CPU.",Neutral
AMD,"~~Arc B580, Rtx 5060, or~~    RX 9060XT 16gb, RX 9070, or RX 9070XT",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, most anything will work in that PC. Depending on your motherboard, you've got ReBAR support and a PCIe 4.0 GPU slot. It depends on your budget and resolution you play at.",Neutral
AMD,I have this combo but the 12gb 3060. If I were you I'd give it a good run with the 3060. It's a fine CPU/GPU setup and spending a lot on a card with a 5600 doesn't really make sense.,Positive
AMD,3060 12gb is as or more expensive than a 9060xt 16gb at this point.,Negative
AMD,"I play mainly like recent AAA games, the new resi interests me and as for resolution, I play on a 55"" TV and I'm used to my PS5 Pro so anything over 1080p at 60fps is good for if it stays there for a few years",Positive
AMD,"I just need mid range, something that can handle stuff along the lines of the new resi at 1080-1440p, mid range cars £600 max as I'm not a massive gamer, just looking for something to last a few years whenever I fancy picking up a game",Neutral
AMD,"I have 32gb ram as well, I'll have a look at the 6800, thanks",Neutral
AMD,"Awesome, thanks",Positive
AMD,"Oh yeah, intel board are a thing now, are they really any good?",Negative
AMD,B580 is worse than a 3060. The others are side grades. A decent upgrade would be a 9060 or 7800xt.,Negative

AMD,"1. not in the US, 3060 12gb is $340 at retail 2. even if it's outside the US, i don't care if it's some absurd ""$700"" price for a 3060 12gb. The 9060xt 16gb is more valuable, it sells for more on ebay. It's faster. There's no world where he's selling the 3060 12gb to then be able to buy a 9060xt and have extra money.  Only ebay sold prices are relevant for what's ""more expensive"". And the 3060 is not.",Neutral
AMD,"Glad I bought my brand new 3060 for $250 on September last year just before RAMageddon.  If I were to buy a GPU today, I would definitely go used.",Positive
AMD,"I would assume your 3060 probably does just fine for 1080p/60FPS. A budget here would certainly help, but I would think something like a 9070 would probably offer the most benefit over a 3060 for a reasonable price.",Positive
AMD,"Sorry I missed there was already a 3060 in the setup. Arc B580 is a great value budget GPU, but would be a sidegrade from a 3060  You'd probably want to look at AMD GPUs since Nvidia's have had price hikes recently.  RX 9060XT 16gb, RX 9070, or RX 9070XT",Positive
AMD,"Yeah I missed OP already had a 3060 in the rig  RX 9060XT 16gb would be a decent bit of uplift, but 9070 or 9070XT would be more impactful",Neutral

AMD,"Piggybacking to say, as OP is in the UK, cheapest 9060 XT 16GB is ~£350 and 5060Ti 16 GB is ~£400. 14% price increase for a 0-10% increase in performance depending on the game.   Alternatively, 16GB 9070s and 12GB 5070s are ~£500 or if you want future proofing then the 9070 XT can be found for ~£580 which is at the top end of your budget",Neutral

AMD,You should get a cheaper X3D and a better graphics card.,Positive
AMD,"Why not a 7800x3d or 7600x3d with a 9070 xt/5070ti ? Your CPU is a high end gaming cpu while your gpu is closer to entry level than mid tier.    It's unbalanced. In gaming, for most games the 7600x3d/7800x3d/9800x3d have very similar performances, very often there's only 5% difference at most, so you're better off getting a better GPU, it'll be a bigger difference.",Neutral
AMD,"Hi, I was reading a comment just the other day that said these sites where you test bottlenecks are pretty much useless. they will almost always say you have a bottleneck to make you click links to higher cost products so they can make commission if you buy the product. They are click machines, not meant to provide you anything of value.   So, the best thing you can do is go to youtube, search for your parts and see how they perform video editing for instance, or whatever it is that you do. it will take some time but you should start finding videos of people rendering and talking about their setup. Whether it works, what could be improved etc. Also, try asking in ""video editing"" subreddits or ""rendering"", whatever it is you do and they will likely give you some good answers on whether your setup will be sufficient.",Negative
AMD,with a $2k budget you should get the 9070xt or a 5070ti. you'll love the extra performance in gaming,Positive
AMD,Thank you guys for the quick replies.,Positive
AMD,">I checked multiple bottleneck sites and all of them show a bottleneck.  There will always be a bottleneck.  That's just how it works.  Something will always be the reason you aren't getting better performance.  The 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU on the market.  It isn't going to bottlenect any GPU.  That said honestly, I'd drop down to a 7800X3D and get a 9070XT personally.",Negative
AMD,I would go with a cheaper CPU and put more money into the GPU.   I for an example use a Ryzen 7700 with my RTX 5070 ti.,Neutral
AMD,"I would stay where you are. 9800x3d is modern CPU and there is no point to buy old CPU which costs as new.  If you have some money, add and buy 9070xt gpu. But difference is not significant, you can even achieve something near 9070xt by overclock/undervolt of 9070.",Neutral
AMD,"In most PCs, there will be some degree of either CPU or GPU bottlenecking. One will have overhead that the other doesn't fully match. So don't stress too much about bottleneck unless you're getting seriously mismatching products (3060 with a 9800x3D would be an example of one product bottlenecking the other significantly)  If you can stretch the budget, I would really recommend the 9070XT, but if that's not doable, the components you've chosen will work great together. That 9800x3D also gives you scope to upgrade GPU later down the line and likely still keep up with it somewhat well. Frankly, an RTX 5080 is still complimented well by a 7800x3D, so a 9070 with a 9800x3D will work great for gaming, maybe even overkill. For productivity, it depends what you're wanting to do. Some more details would be good, but if I'm right, the job won't be for another 2 years, which makes it really hard to gauge if this is a good build or not for your needs.  My advice? Building a PC right now with productivity in mind two years later, is going to have some disappointment eventually. No PC is fully futureproof and we have no idea what the standard of software and hardware will be (especially with this particularly volatile PC market). I would advise focusing on what you need right now, and properly deciding the elements that are most important to you.   For example - if this PC is purely for gaming for the next 2 years, is it worth the money you're about to spend on it? What's your goal and typical gaming style, 1080p 60fps ultra, 1440p 144fps high, competitive, single player, fps>graphics or vice versa, etc.. Do you mind using Frame Generation or Upscaling to achieve your desired resolution and frames?",Neutral
AMD,"So before you stop looking at this post/remove it I do want to mention something. Most of these guys are trivializing bottleneck sites which is fair. Do they lie sometimes? Yes. However your computer will bottleneck because of the cpu being too powerful. That is something important for you to know. The level of which is irrelevant to you in this situation but you do need to know.   Will this impact anything you plan to do in the future? Almost certainly not. Do you need to know this if you ever plan to upgrade the lifeline of your future living? Absolutely.   When you ask the question like you did most people are saying yes it will turn on and have a working graphics card in it.   However to better inform you, your processor will not stop bottlenecking until you surpass a 5070ti in power. Whether that be a 5080 (rip wallet) or waiting in 5 years for something in the 60 series or such. I hope that serves you well when you go to upgrade or build a new set up.",Neutral

Because if both the 5060ti and the 9060ti meet your performance standards in gaming, then you could consider the additional $180AUD spent on an Nvidia GPU to be an 'investment' in improved Blender performance and the question would be, is that $180AUD worth 117% more blender performance?

AMD,">\- shouldnt the new computer be many times faster, to be able to perfom better then the old one?  That hasn't been true for quite a while because even though the technology has improved we really don't need all that performance.  It's kinda like the megapixels in digital cameras.  In the early days every additional megapixel added to the sensor made a huge difference in quality.  But once we started going beyond 6 megapixels (don't quote me on the exact number) the image quality did not have as much of an impact.  The difference between a 50 and 100 megapixel camera is only beneficial to applications that can take advantage of it.  Just like a computer with 24 cores on the processor are mostly useless until you run an application that can take advantage of all 24 cores at the same time.  >\- wondering, does a descrete graphics make such a huge impact in a pc perfomance?  Similar answer as above as you need an application like a game to truly see the impact.  Otherwise merely browsing the web, checking email, and watching Youtube ain't gonna make a difference even if it's a discrete vs integrated GPU.  There are many reasons why your newer system could have felt slower than your older system, but have you ever compared the time it takes to convert between the two systems on the same OS?  For all you know the conversion time on the newer system might be faster than the old but you have to run them both on the same OS and do your time comparisons.  It could be the way the software is configured on the old system that allows it to take advantage of hardware acceleration while the new system isn't set up properly.  Also your old system got to use those drives while they were young and fresh while the new system has to use the same drives while they're being grandpas.  You are trying to compare a server processor to a desktop processor and servers do excel at multiple I/Os.  That said the technology gap should've rendered this argument moot.",Neutral

AMD,"Use Task Manager to drop the priority of the processes doing the conversion.  Media encoding is a very intensive multi-threaded multi-core operation.

If you have a profile to use the GPU's video encoder, VCN2.2, use that. This is likely what you were doing on the GTX 1050.

AMD,AMD a joke fr,Negative
AMD,Okay but what about DLSS4.5? have you seen how it is #NVDA good?,Neutral
AMD,I just bought a 5080 to replace my 9070XT. Got it on launch and gave them a year to impress me but alas they dropped the bomb again. If anyone is looking for a 9070XT hellhound w/ MC 3yr warranty hit me up :),Neutral
AMD,"What a disgrace, without optiscaler 9000 series would have been a failure.",Negative
AMD,What is optiscaler?,Neutral
AMD,"Nobody buys their GPUs, how could they possibly fund much more than this? Being the hardware partner for the PlayStation, Xbox, Steam Deck, and the modern go-to for CPUs? They're basically flat broke.",Negative
AMD,"Their GPU division is probably 4 dudes and an AI modeled after Ruby, the old ATI mascot.",Neutral
AMD,The way r/Radeon talks about them sometimes you would unironically think AMD is some small scrappy startup in someone's garage,Neutral

AMD,Jimbo's only an intern.,Neutral
AMD,One of them is just the buildings janitor.,Neutral
AMD,Amd is a hardware company as large as Nvidia with like software as a hobby project.   Nvidia has a software company as large as their hardware company making their drivers.   Unfortunately amd keeps trying to make unified architectures and then abandons them when they're not ideal.,Negative
AMD,nvidia poaches amd driver devs aggressively,Neutral
AMD,FSR4 looks fine but I can see why even game developers aren't moving on it when amd gpus are like 10% of the market.,Negative
AMD,"Why would they care lol, gamers aren't buying double digit billions of GPU like data centers are.",Neutral
AMD,"They are also shifting to AI, from a purely monetary perspective they can sell AI GPUs for substantially more profit than consumer gaming GPUs. AMD is currently investigating heavily in trying to bring down power consumption for AI GPUs.",Neutral
AMD,AMD is also trying to be an AI company eventhough nobody takes them seriously in that space. Have you seen the AI bloat in their software?,Negative
AMD,AMD is just as guilty as Nvidia. They're all on board on A.I.,Negative
AMD,They want the ai money too.,Neutral
AMD,Nvidia is shifting to AI but they still have a dedicated Geforce Team. AMD is just so lost.,Negative
AMD,Amd just signed a deal with meta for AI gpus. They don’t give a fuck about gaming. Data centers are way more lucrative.,Negative
AMD,It's more profitable for AMD to sell for AI-stuff with 5x the margin.,Positive
AMD,I can’t believe gamers think AMD is their friend,Negative
AMD,"Most of DLSS 4.5 works on any RTX card, you can't use Dynamic MFG on anything except 50-series... but can use other features from 4.5",Neutral
AMD,"Amd and meta just signed a deal for AI gpus. Amd didn’t give a flying fuck before, but now I doubt we’ll see any movement regarding fsr4. I have a 4090 rig and a 9070xt rig, it’s a shame because RDNA4 is solid hardware but the software still isn’t there.",Negative
AMD,IMO the fact that DLSS can be upgraded by simple DLL swap (or even simpler DLSS swapper or Nvidia app) is one of its biggest advantages over FSR,Positive
AMD,"You clearly never had a 9070 XT. A 9000 used can enable FSR 4 override in Adrenalin to upgrade almost every FSR 3.1 game to FSR 4, **exactly** like you got DLSS 4.5 in DLSS games via NVAPP.",Neutral
AMD,You can upgrade fsr 3.1 to fsr 4 through the driver if on rdna 4,Neutral
AMD,I've had a 9070XT since launch day and the Windows drivers got FSR3.1->FSR4 support pretty quickly after my card arrived.,Positive
AMD,AMD didn't discontinue driver support for RDNA 2.,Neutral
AMD,RDNA3 is 2 years newer than RDNA2 and its ISA has more in common with RDNA4 and than 3.  There's no way it's ending this year.,Neutral
AMD,"I was all set to buy a 9070 XT until they decided to no longer support even the previous generation cards for FSR4.   After that came out I bought a 5070 FE instead, have a 5070 Ti on the way, and have a B580 being delivered today.   All of those cards could have been AMD cards if they hadn’t taking a huge dump on owners of their previous generation cards.",Negative
AMD,It just works.,Positive
AMD,"If a ""hacky"" solution works this well it means that AMD could add an option to force enable FSR4 directly in through driver.   Devs don't have to do anything.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah,Neutral
AMD,"A way to force different upscalers through an external program manually placed into the game code. Very useful for AMD and Intel gpus, as it can unofficially force a newer version of an upscaler in older or unsupported games.   It’s typically used to put fsr4 support in many games, seeing as the supported games list is still pretty small. In this case, there’s now a way to force fsr4 into vulkan api based games, which even AMD have been unable to do so far.  Mind you, it’s risky to try this in multiplayer games with anticheat, as the anticheat could notice injected files made by optiscaler and consider it hacking.",Positive
AMD,"> OptiScaler  if a game has DLSS only, OptiScaler can be used to replace DLSS with XeSS or FSR 3.1",Neutral

AMD,It’s not like the entire Linux gaming community loves their GPUs or anything. Poor little AMD,Negative
AMD,r/amd says this unironically,Neutral
AMD,That’s true nobody buy there gpus only if have no choice due budget reasons since  Nvidia wanna discontinue a lot of it gpus for ai only got amd gpus as budget ends,Negative
AMD,"Game developers are moving onto it though, the issue is entirely on AMD not having official Vulkan support yet for FSR4.",Neutral
AMD,Exactly this. They also know the gaming market will be there after the bubble bursts (sooner the better),Positive
AMD,"Nobody takes them seriously? AMD got an unprecedented YoY growth for 2025.    For a company that no one takes seriously they're making quite a lotta money, it seems.    Hell it even ramped in Q4, it was about 3-3.5 billion for the data centre segment in Q2 and almost 6 billion in Q4.    Almost doubling the revenue in 6 months is insane.",Negative
AMD,> they still have a dedicated Geforce Team  The guys who sold GPU's with Reflex 2 on the box 13 months ago and then forgot? :D,Neutral
AMD,I can use Mfg and i dont..dont see the point on anything more than fg2x,Neutral
AMD,You can also do that with FSR for a while now it just doesn’t work with older versions cause they used a different approach.,Neutral
AMD,the Nvidia App can update any version of DLSS not just a specific version which the game might not have.,Neutral
AMD,People on this sub have been caught hook line and sinker by Nvidia. There's no point arguing with them.   And I'm not saying AMD is perfect before any of you come at me.,Negative
AMD,Never saw an override button. Either way DLSS is still clear of fsr regardless of version. So happy with my switch. Nvidia frame gen is also a lot clearer. Pluss I have nvidia hdr. This is coming from a longer amd user. Not just an nvidia fanboy.,Positive
AMD,AMD always grabs defeat from the clutches of victory. There is very little doubt in my mind that they discontinue RDNA 3 driver support or put it in the bullshit RDNA 1 & 2 branch that definitely won’t quietly enter maintenance mode.,Negative
AMD,SIXTEEN TIMES THE FRAMES,Neutral
AMD,"AMD says the game dev has to and there is more to optiscaler than just a switch to enable that's making that happen   Serious question here. I really am curious. Are we talking about 3 games that are older than the GPUs? If so, why would we need any upscaling/fg for these games on these gpu's?    It just seems to me that it's just not worth the time and effort or that I am missing something here. I'd rather be proven wrong and be right going forward than continue being wrong",Neutral
AMD,"they can't because of the legality of a different company replacing Nvidia's DLL would look VERY bad. Thats the main reason why optiscaler can do it and AMD cant. if something breaks officially under AMD, AMD takes all the heat. If something breaks under optiscaler, its YMMV because its an unofficial mod and their not obligated to do anything specific because its not a company.",Negative

AMD,It was great for boarderlands 4 uising FSR4 on my 7900xtx,Positive
AMD,Couldn't be more wrong,Negative
AMD,"You make it sound like Nvidia users don't use it. For example, Ampere users can freely use it to enable frame gen for gpus abandoned by nvidia for said feature, whether one likes it or not.",Neutral
AMD,"I use it with every DLSS game on Nvidia, because it's the only way to unfuck DLSS.",Neutral
AMD,"That's an unfair comparison, Linux users don't have to use AMD's drivers. They get to use RADV instead, which has a grand total of 0 AMD engineers working on it.",Negative
AMD,"As a non-profit little org, they should have all the help they can get from the community.",Neutral
AMD,"I wouldn't say love, but I do feel called out now.",Negative
AMD,They also know most folk will flock back to Nvidia the moment the bubble bursts also.,Neutral
AMD,It's more to do with Nvidia not having enough capacity than AMD being better. Nvidia is still the goto for Graphic Cards.,Neutral
AMD,The same one that released DLSS 4.5. Much better than whatever the hell AMD is doing which is just sad.,Negative
AMD,"MFG, and Dynamic MFG are not the same...  Yes,  you can use MFG, and use 2x or 4x etc... but what you can't do is set a target FPS, then have D-MFG only generate frames in-between when needed to hit the target FPS, rather than a set multiplier...",Negative
AMD,"If I'm not mistaken, DLSS1 can't be overridden, but it is such a small number of games now and those titles are old enough that it really doesn't matter anymore.",Negative
AMD,"Only in games Nvidia whitelisted. If they didn't, like Diablo 2 Resurrected, you have to completely uninstall Nvidia App to make override work via Profile Inspector, else NVAPP reverts settings on each launch and you're stuck with DLSS 2 maxing out at ""Quality"".",Negative
AMD,"Well, not really 3, more like around a 100 with FSR2 and 3, seeing how seemingly optiscaler is able to switch out both with FSR4.   Mind you, a lot more of the games listed on [the wiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/List_of_games_that_support_high-fidelity_upscaling) where I got my rough count from has a lot more DLSS games that can be ""updated"" with Nvidia latest, than there are games with AMDs fsr games for FSR4.",Neutral
AMD,>they can't because of the legality of a different company replacing Nvidia's DLL would look VERY bad.  That is not the issue here. Optiscaler replaces FSR2 and FSR3 with FSR4. AMD could very well do the same through its own official drivers.,Negative
AMD,"Definitely let them know, it’s a pretty handy tool coming from someone with an rx 9070xt and a few Rdna 3 based gpus. In my experience, I’ve found quite a few games with shitty FSR implementation, none at all, or awful anti aliasing, so having something to improve it is a godsend.   Mind you, it does impact performance a bit- especially on non rdna 4 gpus- so their milage may vary.",Positive
AMD,"I personally use it for Deep Rock Galactic and the demo for a new indie game, Far Far West (ironically, both unreal games). Works as great anti aliasing when FXAA and TAA are the only options. Also, cause I have it swapping with DLSS, which is the only supported upscaler in FFW.",Positive
AMD,"Ok, for non-rdna4 amd users",Neutral
AMD,*Mesa,Neutral
AMD,"Does it matter? AMD is still making several times yearly gaming GPU revenue in one quarter. The only reasonable option is going ham for data centers.    Btw AMD datacenter GPUs with same TFLOPS at half price of Nvidia still make more money than gaming GPUs.    I hate it, but data center is the way.",Negative
AMD,"It's really not. You can't just change your entire software stack on a whim like that. That works for normal consumers, not for extremely hardware restrictive research. This was planned in advance.",Negative
AMD,dynamic mfg is still to be released tho ?,Neutral
AMD,According to PCGamingWiki the games with DLSS1 are:  Anthem (cant even play it anymore)  Battlefield V  Final Fantasy XV  Metro Exodus (irrelevant cause the Enhanced Edition has DLSS2)  Monster Hunter World  Outpost Zero,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, it can't work for DLSS 1 because it was AI image upscaling. Starting with DLSS 2, DLSS is a TAA(U).",Negative
AMD,"I'd like to see AMD get it working. If fsr4 wasn't so much better than anything previous then it wouldn't be a big deal. I definitely saw the difference between 3 and 4 in Hogwarts Legacy (with the dll swap, not optiscaler). FSR3 gave a lot of fps but the hair was horrible and distracting. Then I noticed everything else also looked way better with fsr4   However, using optiscaler, wouldn't it still be better to use dlss4(4.5) instead?",Neutral
AMD,did AMD not release the FSR override option for the DLLs with the redstone update?  > Optiscaler replaces FSR2  FSR2 doesn't use a DLL. the DLL was added in AFAIK during FSR 3.1. You can't swap something that doesn't exist.,Neutral
AMD,"So I'm trying to understand. Amd said performance would not be good and choose to not release fsr4 on older GPU just the 9xxx series. Hacker man's on the internet got it working on older amd GPUs, but it does impact performance like amd has said. So how far back of a GPU can we go before performance goes unplayable??   Also completely unrelated, but I do remember a time where people didn't want dlss or fsr, they wanted real frames and games to be optimized...I'm showing my age now xD.",Negative
AMD,"RADV is a component of mesa. AMD does have engineers on Mesa, they author most of the OpenGL driver. I specified RADV to note that AMD does not have anyone helping the Vulkan driver.",Neutral
AMD,"> dynamic mfg  officially not yet no, April they said.... :)",Neutral
AMD,>did AMD not release the FSR override option for the DLLs with the redstone update?  Only works on 9000 series cards.  Optiscaler works even on 6000 series.,Neutral
AMD,">So how far back of a GPU can we go before performance goes unplayable??  FSR 4 on RDNA 2/3 is times faster than DLSS 4.5 on RTX 2000/3000, so AMD really had no reason to not release it.",Neutral
AMD,"No clue, but I’ve seen a few reports of people using it on RDNA 1 and older. So, pretty much the limitation is whether or not the hit to performance is worth it, like you asked.  As for your other point, I agree, for the most part. Unfortunately, a lot of games are now relying on TAA now, which almost always looks absolutely awful at native, and having the feeling of higher fps with lower end hardware isn’t awful. That being said, if I don’t need either I’m not using either lol.",Negative

AMD,I mean the previous Death Stranding ran pretty well on pc from what I remember.,Positive
AMD,"Nixxes’ specs in the past assumed that you used dynamic resolution scaling to hit the fps targets. So it won’t be native all the time, but I wouldn’t expect it to regularly drop to performance upscaling either.",Neutral
AMD,"1080p60 medium settings, WITH FGEN ENABLED.... rofl",Neutral
AMD,Kind of doubt it. The RX6600 is recommended for the same level of performance and that’s an 8GB card. The 8GB version of the 3060 is pretty notably slower than the 12GB version VRAM aside so that seems like the more likely reason it was chosen.,Neutral
AMD,"Notice they have a 9070XT comparable to a 4080, where realistically the 9070XT is on par with the 4070 TI (they trade blows often).  I suspect that the amount of RAM your card has is very important in this game.",Neutral

AMD,"Though I'm inclined to give Zero Dawn a pass, since it was developed as an exclusive.

AMD,"Forbidden west runs pretty good on pc I dunno where that comes from. DS2 ran like dickhole on the ps5 as well considering it's an engine designed for super fast movement and massive robot battles, and yet DS2 puts the ps5 on its knees fighting 4 little mech dudes as a geriatric. all while still looking worse than the ps4 version of HFW.  I'm ride or die that Decima is a gift Kojima did not deserve, and has grossly under-utilized. Still this port is going to be a banger no matter what since I'd bet within the first day the trench coat will be modded in.",Negative

This was with Discord and a browser running in the background. I had long sessions of 3-4 hours with the Steam performance overlay always on, lol.  From what I've heard and seen, the community consensus is that DS1 is a well-optimized game and was a good port. This aligns with my experience and the experience of four friends to whom I recommended the game, and they finished it on different machines without any technical problems.

AMD,SM2 and TLoU2 were ported back to back in a short amount of period in the beginning of 2025. I guess Nixxes were spread thin by Sony.  This is Nixxes' first port since TLoU2 (almost a year later) so hopefully they deliver a good port.,Positive
AMD,"Sm2 is a shit show? It was rough at launch but it is fine now,  no?",Negative
AMD,"Lol same, never noticed performance issues that pulled me out of the game, it runs great for how amazing it looks.",Positive
AMD,"You don't notice it because you're playing the slowest moving protagonist of the last decade and the game is saturated in a sickening amount of blur effects, which were again, designed for much faster paced games.  The fps and resolution tank pretty hard in the handful of fights where you fight a bunch of the little orange guys, and all the sequences with copy paste mads mikkelson guy. Every BT fight you're either standing in the desert or staring at the skybox the entire time.  It's not like performance even matters on such a chill game, and it's not even the tip of the iceberg of what the poor aspects of the game are, but people claiming any of the hundreds of people Kojima takes credit for are using Decima effectively, let alone half as well as Guerilla does is a mental take.",Negative

Current gen is Zen 5, with 6th gen likely to be announced sometime in the later half of this year.), the graphics card was at best mid-end when it released, there's no info about the RAM speed (Googling the model doesn't seem to give the info outright either), the SSD is a SATA based model (and the motherboard doesn't seem to feature much in the way of a M.2. slot for a faster upgrade).  It's a fine enough PC, but there's a lot of caveats like the age of the parts, and the lack of potential upgrade paths.   That being said, it'll likely run fine for R6. Valorant might be an issue if they drop Win10 support due to kernel level anticheat. It can install Windows 11, but requires a workaround due to a lack of TPM chip",Neutral
AMD,"Thank you much! Im trying to learn more about PC's, it can be hard knowing where tk ststt, and tbere being so many manufacturers for parts.

AMD,"The click is made by a relay and is completely normal. It doesn't indicate anything on its own.  For OP: Sometimes a shorting USB, especially BIOS FLASH slot can prevent start. It's unlikely your case, but you can test it anyway. Turn the PSU off and hold the power button for a few seconds to fully discharge. Turn the PSU on and immediately (within a second) press the power button. If it powers on, it's a shorting USB and you can bypass it by setting Erp S5 in BIOS.",Neutral

AMD,"Has anyone tried launching emulators w/Vulkan graphics back-end under 26.2.2, RX 9070/XT GPUs? From my experience, 26.2.2 introduces some major Vulkan regressions that weren't even identified as changes in the release notes.  Some of the emulators/apps affected...Dolphin, Eden, Citron, Yuzu, basically anything that initializes Vulkan. Launch games within these emulators, and they crash immediately. Not sure if this is limited to 90xx series GPUs or if the issue spans across AMD's entire line of GPU's under 26.2.2...  Had to roll back to 26.2.1 which fixed the Vulkan crash behavior.  Problems that still exist with a number of AMD CPUs/GPUs under the newest driver releases...sleep states with mini-PCs with RDNA2/3 etc. - S0/S3 CPU sleep states often result in instability under idle conditions, unreasonable memory usage after displays go into sleep states.

AMD,"Aight... what did we change from 25.x.x to 26.x.x that causes driver time outs to be rather consistent with wireless VR set ups? Even the Official VRChat patch notes read as such;  >""Update your AMD drivers to at least 25.10.2* if you encounter issues with video playback or stutter in VR! If you're still having trouble (that you don't have on live), open a Canny with your driver version and specific GPU hardware please.   >if you use Virtual Desktop or other wireless VR software, newer drivers of the 26.x series may cause issues instead. Stick to 25.10.2. This is unrelated to this fix."" - VRChat Feb 24th Patch notes  I get if VRChat stutters and I have never minded it. I get a lot of unoptimized renders can be happening. Though this is the first time I have had full driver timeouts occurring. When a stutter happens, yes the headset can lock up even for a long one resulting in a black view out of your sight area but they tend to recover. Now I get driver timeouts and this will cause Steam VR to disconnect for a short period and then reconnect, except my headset no longer updates my view even if I'm still being tracked by my VR.

Regular laptop chips are officially supported by both OEM and AMD so they can use drivers from both side, but all Z series chip cannot install drivers on [amd.com](http://amd.com) without an inf hack, and the official driver distribution is done solely by OEM instead. This helps AMD reduce QA cost in exchange for lower chip pricing.",Neutral
AMD,"So repeat of the mobile chip driver disaster for laptops up to around 2011.     If you bought a laptop, the laptop manufacturer had to provide the driver.   Do you know what they did not provide? Updates.

AMD,The GPU driver situation on the ROG Ally devices that use this chip was already annoying as instead of just getting the latest updates directly from AMD you had to wait for ASUS to push them (which happened sporadically at best) and now it seems it won't be happening at all.

AMD,"Driver Updates need to be standard for the average lifetime of the device, it's not asking alot to at least provide generic drivers that are reasonably up to date or allowing people to at least be able to install the normal drivers from amd.com. Trying to ditch driver support after just 2 years is not on and while I'm not 100% at least in the EU that might raise some red flags around creating ewaste by refusing to update a device after just a few years from launch. 5 years at least is the minimum a device should be supported.",Negative
AMD,"AMD needs to stop doing this. Create a standard driver, then have custom vendor blobs on top. Standard driver comes from AMD. Vendor updates their specific blobs separately and are encouraged not to tie customizations to any one version of driver. Nothing should break if base driver is updated without a blob update, in other words.  This is not terribly difficult. Laptops are the same way and it's annoying due to little vendor-specific customizations, like display timing adjustments or backlight control (like smooth granular increase/decrease instead of jarring fixed steps) and other little things that can affect power consumption. I often get the best battery life on vendor-specific driver for my HP laptop vs generic driver.",Neutral
AMD,Steamos or linux. Anyway.,Neutral
AMD,Amd is surprisingly the best choice on Linux / steamos and the worst on windows.,Positive
AMD,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't AMD Adrenalin just ""magically"" get the relevant drivers for this, along with other RX 6000 chips?

AMD,> and the official driver distribution is done solely by OEM instead.   Any product that does it that way these days should just be avoided.  MSI does the same for Intel GPU drivers on the iGPU on some models. Installing Intel ones kills switchable graphics on some models and only MSI ones will work (which are never updated).,Negative
AMD,Lenovo dropped support too so maybe they stopped OEM level support too,Negative
AMD,"There's a reason why business prebuilts/laptops are sometimes more expensive, the support lifecycle is guaranteed to be 3-5 years.

Severely outdated vendor GPU drivers hampered usability back then. Thank god AMD did the good and allow users to use generic driver releases.",Negative

Sometimes Valve contracts the people directly, sometimes it's through a consulting firm like Collabora or TechPaladin, but wherever you look in the Linux ecosystem, you'll probably find a lot of the work being done is funded by Valve.

AMD,"I think people have no idea how AMD's CPUs are made. They make full wafers for enterprise consumers and bin them for power efficiency at a certain performance level. Not every chip can pass this threshold so they get pushed down to the general consumers. Then they get selected to be 8 cores or 6 cores. These chiplets are then joined through infinity fabric to make 12 and 16 cores.  The entire wafer of silicon is paid up front, so them not selling the rejects is wasted money.

Most people that have a device with an AMD CPU will not even know that fact. Even most gamers don't know what hardware they used and those are already WAY more interested in this topic. Only the faction of gamers or nerds that do build their own PCs will actually know this.

AMD,I was thinking the main difference is X3D performance when using slower memory as memory is so expensive,Neutral
AMD,Not really no. The 3d chiplet works great for games an still works really well for productivity. Basically one clocks higher than the other but doesn't have extra cache. The difference is minimal and ends up giving the same or better performance than a non 3d cache cpu would. 9950x and x3d perform the same outside of gaming,Positive

For the 9800X3D, AMD revealed that the bottom stacked 3D cache was only for Ryzen, so if this is true, the recent 9850X3D has the best Zen V X3D dies. In May 2025, AMD released the EPYC 4585PX, which uses Zen V X3D. There is no information if the cache is on the bottom like the 9800X3D/9850X3D or on top of the die like previous generations.",Neutral
AMD,"X3D chips were shaved to expose the special contacts and then bonded to a separate cache die manufactured on a memory-optimized process library. They also bonded a spacer over the portion of each CPU that the cache did not cover, to maintain even contact with the IHS. This is why the early processors were voltage-sensitive and more difficult to cool.  The updated design places cache beneath the CPU to allow for improved cooling. I think they have also made improvements for independent cache voltage and clock speed to try to make X3D processors more reliable.",Neutral
AMD,"Not all X3D caches pass, some are faulty. Every chip cannot be an X3D.",Negative

No surprise people that are passionate about a thing are more comfortable with getting the better product but paying a premium for it. I bet in the time that Mindfactory sells one CPU Dell or other system sellers use 100 CPUs and only like 5 of them are x3D.,Neutral
AMD,I however definitely inferred that based on how that last sentence is written.  My apologies if that was not the implication.,Neutral
AMD,"For enterprise, power efficiency and performance per watt would be their main goals to reduce total cost of ownership, so those qualities are the ""highest quality."" For PC desktop enthusiasts, higher clock speed at worse efficiency is acceptable. I would prefer to undervolt a higher quality die to achieve comparable/near-equivalent performance to stock.  Enterprise customers are AMD's priority because they can sell more units and/or have long-term supply contracts, which retailers and DIY cannot match. AMD prioritizes EPYC over Ryzen.  Historically, AMD keeps costs low, so it's likely Zen V X3D has one unified design with V-Cache on the bottom for EPYC and Ryzen.",Neutral
AMD,">Enterprise customers are AMD's priority because they can sell more units and/or have long-term supply contracts, which retailers and DIY cannot match. AMD prioritizes EPYC over Ryzen.  This may not be the case for the specific X3D server sku you listed vs consumer stuff. While in general this holds true, the 4585PX is an ultra low end server chip that is literally just the consumer chip rebranded, unlike AMD's main server lineup that at least use the server IOD if not N3 dense Zen 5 chiplets.",Neutral
AMD,if you’re not getting top bins then not really worth it,Negative
AMD,Do Thermalright heatsinks fit on delidded AMDs?,Neutral
AMD,"I understand that is only for the oc people to get the maximum out of their chips.  But damn, i can remember how bad these athlon xp cpu back then without headspreader where. You just had to look at them in the wrong way and their die broke. Never would i use that for my normal pc 🫣",Negative
AMD,"I delidded my own 9800X3D with the Thermal Grizzly delid tool. Wasn't all that bad, just a little stressful as it was my first time doing it. It does suck knowing one bad move and its toast.",Negative
AMD,Waiting for the 9950X3D2,Neutral
AMD,can buy a 9950X3D for 650 euro,Neutral
AMD,Ripoff,Neutral
AMD,"It's cheaper to buy their delid tool and do it yourself. Based on a video I saw on JayzTwoCents, it seems pretty easy to do.",Neutral
AMD,When it dies you have no warranty,Negative
AMD,RIP Silicon Lottery,Neutral
AMD,"You'll need a direct-die cooler for delidded CPUs. Thermal Grizzly also offers a heatspreader which would allow you to mount standard coolers and AIOs, but they do disclose that there may be compatibility issues depending on the mounting kit of the radiator.",Neutral
AMD,Good question.,Positive
AMD,Same. Still waiting. I really hope this thing will drop Q1 and isn't a tide over for Zen 6 and drops Q3,Negative
AMD,Yea but thats not really the point of this product.,Negative
AMD,"It is "" easy"" todo.  It's also ""easy"" to break the cpu this way.",Neutral
AMD,Is the risk also free?,Neutral
AMD,"""Easy to do"" and you have never done it lol. As someone who has done it the process its stressful af and you can easily fuck it up. I would happily pay extra for someone with better tools and knowledge doing it and gives me 0 risk of being left with a $600 paper weight.",Negative
AMD,Thermal Grizzly is actually providing their own warranty on the delidded CPU's which I am sure is part of the reason the prices are high.,Negative
AMD,"Thermal Grizzly is a German company, EU means 2 year compulsory warranty.",Neutral

AMD,"Have you ever used the tool they sell to do it? That’s what I’m referring to. I didn’t say it was easy from experience either. I simply pointed to a video of someone using the tool and said it *seemed* easy to do *based* on that video.   I was simply suggesting an alternative option for people that might want to save some money and are open to some risk. I also pointed to a video, which would suggest some research is required.   I was furthering the discussion, which is what we should be doing on Reddit.",Neutral
AMD,Yea but do they cover the amd 9800x3d failure issue?,Neutral
AMD,"They have to cover any issue, that they cannot prove the customer is responsible for.   If it's a known product issue, that is not commonly known to customers they also have to cover them beyond the 2 years.",Negative

AMD,4.8 ghz? I can do that with my CPU ... oh wait,Neutral
AMD,Nice,Positive
AMD,AMD *designed* the card that broke the world record; AMD did not overclock the card themselves.  > overclockers Bill Alverson “Sampson” and Splave.,Neutral
AMD,"From what I can gather this is likely caused by problematic vBioses that are running on the edge, barely giving the card enough voltage, some drivers also seem to try and ""overboost"" the card beyond the frequency range, some claim it's because the drivers think it's a 9700XT or something, not sure how true that is however.   But yeah, the 7900XT was a shitshow.",Negative
AMD,Same brother. It’s infuriating. Tried so many things and still nothing.,Negative
AMD,find the source of the problem rather than making a pointed effort to tell everyone that you haven't diagnosed sufficiently enough to find it.,Negative
AMD,Bill Alverson works at AMD,Neutral
AMD,"Bill Alverson is an AMD employee, with Splave, an AMD-affiliate assisting, at an AMD event.  So yes, AMD did in-fact beat the world record.",Positive
AMD,"Bro, drivers shouldn't be crashing regardless.   Edit: Here's the reply he deleted:  https://i.redd.it/tp89zfm28skg1.gif",Negative
AMD,"man its just a joke...  but how are you so sure that I haven't been tried to diagnose the issue?   -I've returned to base settings on the CPU and GPU.    -I've reset  to default driver setting. I've used DDU and checked 5 different driver versions for stability.  -I've run progams in compatability mode, varying display and limiting game refresh rates.   -Ive turned off Instant Replay, Game bar and Gaming mode in windows.   -Ive run from full screen to windowed mode.   -Ive changed power supplies, removed cable extensions and repasted and re applied thermal pads.   The only thing that had was worked is running a -100mhz offset from stock settings.  Please, do not tell me to ""find the source of the problem"" because I have tried.",Negative
AMD,"Indeed, we did :-)  hopefully more to come!",Neutral
AMD,"for a joke you sure got serious quick.  If you have do any of those things, it's already apparently not a driver issue and most probably a hardware issue. I've personally witnessed a customer return their gpu twice for replacement and their 3rd one was still throwing timeouts, only to finally convince them to return it as well and their 4th gpu has been problem free since.  Considering DDR5 failure rates, instability (yeah doesn't matter if you're running stock/failsafe settings) this is predominantly the majority of people's issues, I'm currently seeing nearly 40% of the 100+ kits i've received as being a problem, though most don't exhibit a memtest failure or OCCT issue, weirdness, specially a timeout at all, has been traced back to the ram, luckily i have a half dozen kits i've been able to validate, but it's amazing how many kits i've tested and back to back repeated issues, doesn't necessarily have to be timeouts, game crashes that don't really crash, just CTD with no error even, swap to good kit, presto, alls well. Nevermind the other hardware, but even the cases where people overlook their surge protector as the cause or worse, their own home wiring being the root cause.  Everything is a variable, under no circumstances is a timeout ""expected"" behavoir short of intentionally doing something that is certain to cause it.",Negative
AMD,"I chatted to some folks on the AMD Discord and got to convince them to get their launch 9060XTs to \~3.75GHz in Heaven Bench with like 55C core temp + 220W + OCing.

Still hopeful for next gen being the ""World's First 4GHz GPU"" as is AMD tradition (hi 7870 GHz edition, had a 7850 at \~1075-1125 MHz lol).  Totally within reason for ""Stock"" I feel but gonna have to wait, have fun in the labs while you do that before all of us, without LN2! :P",Positive
AMD,"I love stuff like this, you have a blog or channel?",Positive
AMD,Yea how dare they expect the consumer device they purchased to do what it's supposed to! Some people are so entitled,Neutral
AMD,"This is hogwash, there have been substational amount of AM4 users who reported the issues as well.   Most seem to have resolved the issue by downclocking the card, which seems to suggest an ""ambitious"" vbios voltage curve.",Negative
AMD,I think something like this is in my near future. stay tuned,Positive
AMD,"Yeah, HOW DARE a company produce a product, and it fail to work when the product is installed in a system that already has a fault.  I mean, if you dropped a brand new expensive transmission into a vehicle where the engine was already misfiring, or the differential was already -\_-ed, OF COURSE it's the transmission fault, and any REASONABLE consumer would know that it's the new parts fault.  my gaud the reasoning and logic failure of you people, reinforcing the stereotypes and brain rot of reddit.",Negative

I only checked out Wukong in that regards.",Neutral

AMD,Could anyone how to use it on  windows and Linux?,Neutral
AMD,My friend literally last night said that AMD ALLEGEDLY went back on what they said about adding fsr. I myself haven’t confirmed that. Further research is needed,Neutral
AMD,My optimism being a 7900XT owner was unwavering....  Until I saw Nvidia supporting DLSS 4.5 on cards from 2018.  And now I am just disappointed.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, the shimmering in Oblivion Remastered is fixed now. Also the flicker in Avatar:FOP is gone.",Neutral
AMD,"We'll get the INT8 files at the same time we get the release of the complete unredacted Epstein files, and a copy of Half Life 3.",Neutral
AMD,">The cat is long out the bag that RDNA2 and 3 GPUs can run FSR4, and adding the official support alongside FSR 4.1 is the best upcoming moment they have to do it.  Boy do they have a track-record of shooting themselves in the foot. So i doubt it but i sure AF hope so. I got a 9070 XT just for FSR4 but i still held onto my 7900 XTX which is now powering my gf's gaming rig. Would be awesome if she could use FSR4 out of the box just like i do.  Same thing for my steam deck.. i'm using FSR4 everywhere i can with optiscaler but damn, i wish it was officially supported.",Positive
AMD,"Absolutely. I've tested the files on my own rig, and they work great. A little slower than the previous version, but higher quality.",Positive
AMD,"AMD never said that FSR4 on RDNA3 was cancelled. The last statement (from January 2025) was that they were working on it, but needed some time. Now we had leaks that indicate they might still work on it and they confirmed that it's gonna come to the PS5 Pro that apparently has similar problems with FP8 as regular RDNA3. I think a release with FSR4.1 and the PS5 Pro upscaler may have been the plan all along.",Neutral
AMD,"I’m almost certain they will.  My guess is that the trouble is that even the INT8 model is too heavy to run FSR everywhere (on iGPUs and smaller dGPUs) and that they are working on clearing the visual bugs and stability problems.   Also working at such large companies, resource allocation is standardized and it’s hard to justify resources being spent on something when the ROI is low, especially since you’d be pulling people off of FSR5 development, and even ROCM.  It’s know as the “starvation problem” in arbitration where a “lower priority” task essentially gets no forward progress if there is ever a “higher priority” task on the queue.   And there is always a queue of tasks, so things end up sitting on the back-burner seemingly forever.   Not trying to defend AMDs behaviour here, because it’s really horrible that previous customers get left in the dust. I’m just telling you how it is at large companies whom need to standardize and coordinate resources to preserve efficiency.",Neutral
AMD,"INT8 support would only help RDNA 3. For RDNA 2, they would need to build something not using WMMA at all. It might be possible (using DP4a) but it is a much bigger change.",Neutral
AMD,"FSR4 is already so behind, I dont want them to add support to older card just to have an even longer release cycle than we already have.",Negative
AMD,"Same. Decently long time AMD user, started my PC journey with an R9 380. My 9070 XT will probably be my last AMD GPU if they don't get their heads out of their ass and get INT8 official support and vastly improved game support for FSR4.",Neutral
AMD,But fans Will defend them no matter what.,Neutral
AMD,"I agree. This is not the treatment that AMD users are used to.  Conversely, Nvidia initially sold rtx 4000 and 5000 series cards with MFG locked behind these purchases until the recent walk-back.  So like you said in your next comment, vote with your wallet. Its not amd vs nvidia, its consumers vs anti-consumer practices.  Edit: nvidia tool, not amd",Neutral

AMD,"Just play on Linux and don't worry about the Windows driver experience? It's wild how good Linux gaming is these days. Not perfect, specially with some live service games or some obscure old games (which can also have windows issues) but it's pretty damn solid. Especially on AMD. A few more issues/regressions with Nvidia.",Positive
AMD,If that was the case thing would get released because stuff is constantly being worked on.,Neutral
AMD,"I’m out of the loop, what’s up with FSR4?",Neutral
AMD,"Well, I mean there's always something not to like no matter who you buy a graphics card from.   You can have terrible driver support from team red, you can have connectors that are a fire risk from team green, or you can have a GPU that's behind the curve from team blue with no guarante they'll keep making graphics cards in the future.",Negative
AMD,"Nice...that's the biggest deal for me personally. Quality mode has been bugged for so long. Now I know it is not placebo. 26.2.2 drivers are out, so I'm going to check if 4.1 is official.",Positive
AMD,"Any idea about shimmering in Arc Raiders? FSR4 looks so good in that otherwise, and yes including the ML frame gen",Positive
AMD,"Nice, I'd been using Optiscaler on OBR to get around the quality shimmering thing",Positive
AMD,And the Bloodborne PC/current-gen port.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, and RDNA3 is lucky that AMD didn't break the Windows drivers so optiscaler does just work. It's effort, but once it's in a game, it's in.  My 6950 XT? yeahh well drivers after 2023 have some regression AMD made so FSR4 int8 doesn't work properly... it DOES work on 2023 or before drivers, OR if you replace DX12 files in the new drivers with the old ones, it worked rather well in Cyberpunk 2077 for me and FSR4 INT8 was my choice over XeSS that I had used before. It was a little more costly, but also had a decently better reconstruction to make up for it and more. And FSR3/2 in Cyberpunk always sucked for quality.  BUT again, you at least are ripping files from 2023 into the drivers or outright using 2023 drivers which will mean fixes done afterwards will be gone, and one big one for me is Forza Horizon 3 actually got fixed last year with a terrible visual glitching issue that it had since 2022 drivers was fixed. And that's an old game from 2016. So official support would be much easier as latest drivers would be no issue to use.  Good for Steam Deck tho is that Linux drivers do work with FSR4 INT8 already, RDNA3 can even emulate the FP8 version on Linux. But if a tiny Steam Deck GPU can run FSR4... the entire RDNA2 stack can, it's just AMD for some reason sitting on the code their devs made and saying ""nah."", likely to try to push RX 9000 sales instead of having RDNA2/3 owners wait until future GPUs on newer nodes that will be faster, better fps per watt and have better features than RDNA4 and so also last longer until they get upgraded again.",Positive
AMD,Forgetting about RDNA2? I won't be happy with just 3 when 2 supports INT8 all the same,Positive
AMD,"The INT8 version does not use WMMA, and [works perfectly fine on RDNA2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTrfnLvZbu4). The WMMA stuff is probably the vkd3d-proton thing, where it uses WMMA instructions on rdna3 to emulate fp8 support.",Neutral
AMD,"It's always been DP4a, as instruction output is quadrupled for each SIMD32 (INT8*4 ops for 32 threads). Across the WGP, that's 128 ops * 4x SIMD32s or 512 ops. Coincidentally, that's the exact output of RDNA3's WMMA INT8 as well. RDNA2, therefore, has the same INT8 throughput.  I find that interesting. WMMA was never needed for INT8 since the rate multiplier wasn't high enough in RDNA3 anyway.",Neutral
AMD,"FSR4 is not behind really at all, it's great. Just needs official support.",Positive
AMD,"FSR4 is good quality already, it'd probably be better to expand the support to previous Radeons. Also, IF RX 6000 and 7000 got it, it'd massively increase the amount of users able to use it and so encourage game devs to add in FSR4 more than it is right now with only RX 9000 and no more.",Positive
AMD,"All this longtime user talk lol. I’m in my mid 30s and started with an ATI Rage.   That said, INT8 support was already tested on RDNA 2. Release it AMD.",Neutral
AMD,"Interestingly, I was thinking I should start looking into AMD gpus after being a lifelong Nvidia user. I simply cannot stomach their prices anymore.",Negative
AMD,"Also started with a 380, and also thinking my 9070 XT will be the last AMD card I own.",Neutral
AMD,"I’ve always leaned toward AMD, and my 9070XT has been great. FSR4 has been great and I use it every day. That said, the way FSR4 has been handled for older cards has been really frustrating. It’s hard not to question AMD’s long-term commitment to supporting previous generations.  When the time comes to upgrade, it makes me wonder whether switching to Nvidia would make more sense, especially given their broader feature support. That’s disappointing to even consider, because AMD used to feel deeply committed to its customer base. Lately, though, it feels like owners of older hardware have been left behind and AMD does not have the marketshare to be behaving like this.",Positive
AMD,Just like you will complain about it no matter what...,Negative
AMD,I prefer not to debate I simply won't ever buy an AMD GPU again,Negative
AMD,"I'm starting to think AMD is as annoyed about Win11 and is being passive aggressive.  My wife's drive died and I put a small temporary drive in and installed bazzite until we got a replacement.  We replaced her drive, put win11 on and now she misses bazzite lol.",Neutral

AMD,"its been proven since the FSR4 sdk got leaked that it can be supported on rnda2 and rdna3 GPUs, and can literally be modded into games and works great (when the modding is allowed/works as it should), BUT AMD refuses to officially support it for the older cards or give any sort of software support for making converting them easier for old cards.  just super lame when we KNOW it works, we have a modded version that works, but they refuse to give it to us officially",Neutral
AMD,lmao sure. certain AMD 9000 series cards use 12vhpwr connectors as well. id rather have a card with some fucking software support,Negative

AMD,"WMMA simply means that the Data across all 32threads of the wavefront are all part of the same Matrix multiply operation which allows for performance scaling, and optimization of data-access patterns to perform the operation as a single macro instruction taking many clocks.  DP4a does the same DOT product of 2 registers each packed with 4 8bit values and accumulates the result. Each thread in the 32thread wavefront is independent data.  But this is the hard limit as the instruction already operates on two register inputs and one register output.   DOT4 INT8 is the operation. 4multiplys + 4 adds = 8Flops * 32threads per SIMD * 2 SIMD per CU = 512Ops/Clk/CU which is the same INT8 WMMA rate in RDNA3.   But RDNA3 has this same 512Ops/Clk/CU with BF16 and FP16 where RDNA2 would have to use DP2a instructions fitting only half the data in its 32bit registers.   To go a little deeper. Using the entire 32threads of a wavefront, you have 128 INT8 items.  Matrix size is 16x16x16   DOT16 is the operation (dimension of the matrix), and you’d have 8sets of it going on in the single wave.  The same amount of math gets done per clock, except you have your final value in a single reading and writing of the data. Whereas DP4a would have to later accumulate the result of 4 DP4a instructions into that D matrix to get the final DOT16 desired result which wastes excess writes to the register file and makes memory access patterns more inefficient.",Neutral

AMD,"When the RTX 2000 series came out people were so upset that nvidia basically cut feature support going forward for all previous generations but they had to do it to get where they are today. RDNA 4 is the first generation of AMD GPUs that actually have the correct hardware to not have a sub-par modern machine learning based software experience. So, if AMD cuts it off at RDNA 4 but keeps whatever they're working on backwards compatible from the 9000 series and forwards I think that would actually better for them and for all current 9000 series and future owners of AMD GPUs. They have to cut it off somewhere and RDNA 3 just doesn't have the necessary hardware for a good experience with everything they are working on. I know it sucks but I think it might be a good choice for AMD to support RDNA 4 as the oldest generation of hardware that has total support of their machine learning software going forwards. I think it would just detract from the quality of current and future endeavours if they tried to include support for RDNA 3. I know that sucks to hear but it just might be what they need to do in order to really make it work going forwards.  Also, looking at nvidia there's no FG for the 20 and 30 series and no MFG for the 40 series and who knows what there won't be for the 50 series in like 2028 or 2029 when it finally comes out. Hardware is massively changing and while it is we are just going to have generations lacking the proper hardware to support certain features well. I am sure there will be a time when the current hardware change will settle in and then there will be gen upon gen that support all the same features.

AMD,"The 9070 xt is a bit better on ray tracing but slightly worse on rasterization, the 7900xtx will ""last"" your longer due to its vram size, to the point that you might not care about it to be honest but it also depends on your resolution because if are planning to play at 4k 60s the next ~3 years that vram will make the difference.  Personally, i wouldn't care about ray tracing at all though because even with Nvidia GPUs the performance when enabling it isn't worth it despite the amazing visual difference.  The 9070 XT will provide you more performance with newer FSR (4+) and consumes less power + it doesn't have the video recording hardware bug (VCN 4.0 the resolution on the Height at 1080p is gonna end up as 1088, basically whatever recording resolution doesn't divide perfectly is gonna get you this issue, resolution / 16 = result which has to be integer, 1440p and 4k will record perfectly) if you care about that, so again it really depends on what you want.    Both are very performance cards though.",Negative
AMD,"9070XT and it's not even a question.  FSR4 proper, much better ray tracing, more power efficient.  And even with less bandwidth, it is more efficient at using what bandwidth it has so wont even suffer at higher resolutions.  It is also very hard to find situations where 16GB is not sufficient.  Even at 4k, you should be using FSR4 anyways since it's often just better than native.",Positive

AMD,"The problem is that this isn't like GTX to RTX... the INT8 model of FSR4 leaked from AMD, they made it and it WORKS, and looks better than XeSS and FSR 3.1. These GPUs also support hardware RT, DX12U, and INT8 instructions. They are not as far behind as GTX vs Turing. In fact RTX 20 and 30 series also don't have FP8 instruction support yet they still get DLSS 4, and 4.5 upscaling.   AMD's GTX equivalent tier is RDNA1, while half assed vs RTX GeForce, RDNA2 did add the essential feature support needed. RDNA4 merely upgraded to FP8 and copes better with RT. Now yeah Redstone not working on older GPUs could make sense, but the upscaling does work and Nvidia provides it to even a RTX 2060 from 2018.  And honestly frame gen is nowhere close to the importance of upscaling models which also offer better temporal AA solutions at native res vs TAA. The reason DLSS ""beats"" native is because DLSS AA truly is much better than standard TAA. Frame gen is a side show in priority. I'd rather have FSR4 INT8 and sacrifice FSR3 Frame gen than to keep it but no FSR4.",Neutral

RDNA 4 is a big leap in terms of transistor count over RDNA 3; to compare two 32 CU GPUs the RX 9060 XT has 29 billion transistors vs the RX 7600's 13 billion.  A lot of those extra transistors went to ray tracing hardware + a side of supporting higher clock speeds.    Mobile iGPUs aren't going to be fast enough for heavy ray tracing games even if they included the RT hardware, and obviously clocks are limited on mobile platforms for power use reasons.  On the flipside though, better hardware upscaling is appealing for low end GPUs.  So adding just FP8 & a few other things to RDNA 3.5 was probably easier than trying to cut back RDNA4.",Neutral

I really want to see the CCDs and overall architecture act in a more cohesive way. CCDs make sense for server/datacenter, since those operations are exceedingly parallel, almost to a fault.  Gaming, not so much. There are thread spawns with dependencies that can't be on a different CCD currently.  AMD may have to move to grouped CCDs where two to four form a Super Compute Cluster (SCC). These can be tightly linked dies that can communicate and act as one previous CCD. To link them, they simply need to be rotated to where the edge communication connect is (two sides for server or one side for consumer). It can be decently high bandwidth, matching at least local L3 bandwidth. The great thing here is that this also works for server/datacenter operations, but the real winner is us: consumers. Of course, SCCs can accept V-Cache underneath with clever routing.  The cluster can then accept thread spawns with dependencies across any core with the only cost being latency on farthest cores (some firmware and thread schedulers can handle that). A hardware thread scheduler would be nice, but only necessary for mixed core or hybrid silicon. So, if we have 2x standard 12-core CCDs in a single SCC, it'd operate like a large, unified 24-core CPU.  I wouldn't expect this until AM6, sadly.",Neutral

Not necessarily because of chiplets or chip-to-chip communication, but because of the inherent types of things CPU's do in games that you cant necessarily parallelize and how it's still beneficial to have certain primary tasks being handled by a single core or two, while there's not always a ton left to distribute across the rest of the cores.  Like, you could theoretically distribute some things across even more cores, but it's pointless when you're not actually coming close to saturating any of them.

AMD,If I can get a 1 CCD 12 core X3D processor to replace my 7950X3D that'd be an instant buy for me.,Positive
AMD,Honestly we need more cache and more memory bandwidth/channels rather than more cores.,Neutral
AMD,It's time for more cores but they won't help. I can't keep my 8 cores busy as it is. Only very briefly on very specific workloads will it hit 100%. I'm going from a ryzen 5700g to a ryzen 9600x. 8 cores to 6. But up to 45% increased single threaded performance which is what will be noticed. And overall those 6 cores are stronger than the 8.,Neutral
AMD,I don’t know how well games will use more than 16 cores. Amdahl’s Law is strongly observed there already.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but I want 32 or more.",Neutral
AMD,Its true,Neutral
AMD,"The rumors are true, check out ""Moore's law is dead"" youtube channel, he's the most accurate on leaks, he knows people on the inside.",Neutral
AMD,Its fun to speculate but people shouldn't get carried away with it. Wait for Benchmarks as they say.,Neutral
AMD,"16+ cores on a normal consumer level high performance cpu would be an INSANE deal for workstations honestly. From way back we got 2cpu mobo's with xeons in them for the render work pc's. They have a whopping 32 threads lol, high for when we got them, we got some 64 thread ones aswell.",Positive
AMD,It is impossible to use more cores for gaming. We only need like 4-6 cores with high frequency and this will essentially be the ideal gaming processor.,Neutral
AMD,Dude is talking out his ass and does not know jack shit about multithreading,Negative
AMD,what are you doing that you need that many cores?,Neutral
AMD,20 cores one  will probably be wors ebjnned 2x12 with some cores disabled.,Neutral
AMD,"interesting idea, but I doubt they would have all that many chiplets with more than 6 defective cores to make that 4 core CCD. Such ""high L3, few cores"" chiplets could also be used in specific server loads",Negative
AMD,"The four cores would be to few to be useful for gaming though, even with the X3D level of cache ratio. Is there a low thread, high cache workload that's common enough people would pay for that?",Neutral
AMD,"Imagine if they actually create the Ryzen 1, Ryzen 2, Ryzen 4, Ryzen 6, and so on... 💀",Neutral
AMD,"Naming that many configurations is going to be tough, especially on the low end. There are four possible single CCD configurations, but only three product families currently used for those. We might end up in a situation where there's a ""good"" Ryzen 5 and a ""bad"" one",Negative
AMD,What would be the point?,Neutral
AMD,"My prediction is 12 cores for the full chip, and 10 for disabled chips. This gives us 24, 20, 12, and 10 cores. I don't see how a 12 core chip will be cut down to 6 cores. It just isn't happening. Unless they are also producing 8 core chips at the same time with 6 cores for the defective chips. What this means is there won't be any cheap chips. The ryzen 9600x starts at almost 300 Canadian. I'm not sure about the 7600, but that will be the entry point into AM5.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm waiting on zen7 myself. I plan on buying a 9600x anyday now and upgrading to zen7 x3d in the future. It will come with another die shrink, so it should be good.",Positive
AMD,"Me too, I specifically stood by 9700X to have a better reason to upgrade to Zen 6 X3D.",Neutral
AMD,"There should be. And it should be the number one selling chip, just like the ryzen 9800x3d is today.",Positive
AMD,"The rumors are that they will be doing different packaging this time, so it's very likely the link between CCD and I/O will be much faster.  Similar to how Strix Halo is packaged right now.  Direct fanout rather than SERDES over package wires.",Positive
AMD,"Usually they \*are\* trying to give us something like 8, 12, 16, and 24, but due to the nature of silicon they end up with the 6s, 10s, and 20s. if they tossed the weaker bins the expensive ones would cost more to cover for that",Neutral
AMD,Bad dies,Negative
AMD,The zen6 chips will cost more than the 9600x. But we should see the 7600x and 9600x fall in price slightly. Overall AM5 will remain an expensive platform to get into. Unlike AM4 with the 5600 costing a little over 100 Canadian.,Neutral
AMD,Where’s the 7ghz zen 6 then? The 9955X6D? The 9090XT he made multiple vids on nearly a year ago.  As predicted my ass.,Negative
AMD,Plenty of people had rumored a move to 12 core CCD's.  MLID 'just throwing shit at the wall' approach.  Eventually some common sense guesses will come true. smh,Negative
AMD,"What is with you and simping for MLID? You did the exact same thing in the intel subreddit a couple days ago.  And you do realize other leakers have said the same thing, ***LONG*** ago too, right?",Neutral
AMD,It's good to get confirmation. Projects get cancelled or delayed out of the blue all the time.,Negative
AMD,That would only make sense if the yields were trash and most dies were close to being half defective.,Negative
AMD,"No, why would they? It would be like making an 8 core CPU with 2 4-core CCDs with current CPUs, probably even worse of the yields are not too bad.  Dumping the few CCDs they need to disabile that much on the server market makes way more sense.",Negative
AMD,They are small chiplets.  Their yields will overall be pretty great.,Positive
AMD,"Maybe as an OEM only SKU? Trying to sell 2 different 12 core SKU's with different core layouts at retail is probably not worth the confusion. Your average desktop user wouldn't care about the differences, but for gaming the 12 core SKU would be dramatically better.",Neutral
AMD,They might release a variant later in product life or to select market for parts that failed binning late. I'd expect low volume.,Neutral
AMD,6 of the 12 cores? They'd need some fairly bad binned chips for that to be worth it and I doubt that'd be the case.,Negative
AMD,"That would be entirely pointless because it would be worse than a single CCD 12 core due to the added latency, not to mention that they would be better off selling their limited 6 core bins as budget CPUs instead to give them something in the low end.  8 + 8 makes far more sense as most of their 8 core yields will be 8 cores and it gives AMD a cost effective creator SKU that should still be solid for gaming in the same way a 7950x or 9950x is.",Negative
AMD,"I don't think that would actually be cheaper.  The market for a 24-core chip is much smaller than for the 12-core chip.  Yields should be quite good by now, so there will be many 12-core dies.  Supply of 6-core binned dies will be fairly low, and something with that many defects is likely to also have worse performance characteristics, coming from the edges of the wafer.  It's also more expensive to package two dies than one.  There may come a time down the road where a new limited SKU is created to use up particularly good 6-core bins in a 12-core dual-CCD product, but it will take time for those to accumulate, assuming they even choose to hold them back like that.",Negative
AMD,Why are you counting chipset lanes for Intel but only CPU lanes for AMD?,Neutral
AMD,I do to but that many cores is useless. Nothing will be able to use it. Very niche applications only.,Negative
AMD,>ram cost more than your cpu  Yeah. I'm looking at buying the ryzen 9600x and 32 GB DDR5. The ram costs over 500 and the processor under 300. Just wild. My harddrive and video card will also cost more than the processor.,Neutral
AMD,"I think when I bought my 486DX2 66 CPU many years ago, 1 mb of ram was about 70 bucks. And I had 8mb.  Wonder if we are heading back to those days.",Neutral
AMD,"A year ago I bought a 96gig kit for $200, can now sell it for a new pc",Neutral
AMD,And the gpu im looking at is 269$ amazing time to build a pc.,Positive
AMD,"64GB is more expensive than what I paid for my 9070 XT, and the worst part is that it’s only going to get worse before it gets better. We’re in for some tough times.",Negative
AMD,I just started ordering parts when the prices went through the roof. Now im looking for a combo with 64gb ram and 9800x3d or 9850x3d and mobo 🙄,Neutral
AMD,"Sorry, they added it to my work office suite. I'm trying though",Neutral
AMD,"Sorry, but local AI is dogshit.",Neutral
AMD,It’s not consumers asking for ai. It’s the military and enterprises,Negative
AMD,What if I find it useful?,Neutral
AMD,that's like pc cases go up and you stocked 800 of them in your basement. What are you gonna do all this ram.,Negative
AMD,"As always. Hardware first, then software!  If we don't get 12+ cores at mainstream prices we won't get the software for it.",Negative
AMD,Totally agree! Parallelism and multithreading should be a default for modern programming environments and design methods. I used long ago Occam on a transputer (with many cores) and it was just very natural to use it like that. Somehow serial programming became the way to go.,Positive
AMD,"One benefit with 12cores is that it brings with it 50% more L3 cache too, all available to the 1-2 main cores doing the work.",Positive
AMD,"That's cool. What I want is a single CCD with 12 cores. If the games max out on 8 cores that's great, it leaves 4 more cores for the rest of my PC to do the work on other stuff in the background without effecting my game threads.",Positive
AMD,Some of us use our computers to make shit and not just play games.,Negative
AMD,Do you feel the latencies between the 2 CCDs in daily use?,Neutral
AMD,What do you use it for,Neutral
AMD,Same can't wait to replace 7950x3d with the 12 core x3d,Neutral
AMD,"depends on the task and they know it, trying to create a balance. the cache thing though is only became apparent because of zen5’s reuse of io die of zen4",Neutral
AMD,"Why not both? Haha. More cores will improve multithreading in games and apps, too, once they become the new normal.  Just like we used to be stuck with 4 cores, now 8 cores has been mainstream for way too long.",Positive
AMD,"Epyc customers are first, we get the cpu dies that aren't as energy efficient.   Enterprise wants and gets more cores, we get more cores.   They definitely need to improve the the IO dies and/or the cpu chiplet to IO die communication for the Ryzen lines.  That said, if they are going to 12 cores per CCX and 48mb of cache (keeping to the 4mb of L3 cache per core) then that's a decent bump.   Potentially x3D chiplets could have 144mb of L3 cache each!",Neutral
AMD,I’d also shill for more pcie lanes on the consumer. Would love to run multiple NVMEs in system at full capacity without having to bifurcate the top x16 slot. Would love the opportunity to run 2x16 full or 1x16 and one 1x8 if you want 2 additional nvmes.,Positive
AMD,"For sure, but there are a lot of tasks that work better with more cores, even gaming adjacent ones, like compressing or decompressing isos, emulation, etc.   Again, let the new cores and more cache come first, the software will follow later on.   Just think, for gaming, how raytracing was available since 2018 but it's been only a year or two since mainstream games started using raytracing as the baseline for their games (think Indiana Jones or Doom Dark Ages).",Positive
AMD,"Being at 95% on all cores doesn't mean you won't benefit from having even more cores, too.",Neutral
AMD,"Games used to only need a single CPU core way back when. Life...uh, would find a way.   Not saying it will be instantaneous, and it really depends on the genres. Just bought Dyson Sphere Program and the devs are testing it on a 64-core monster and really excited for the potential performance increase.   Also, I can totally see complex open worlds using as many cores as you can throw at them, in the future. Imagine having dedicated cores for systems, like, say, the pedestrian simulation takes a whole core by itself. Which would be impractical today, but if you have, say, 32 Cores at your disposal, it's just another tool in the shed.",Positive
AMD,"Though my 8 core 9800x3D already does all of this without problem, I run a lot of random crap on other monitors so more core better.",Neutral
AMD,Zen 7,Neutral
AMD,You’re still stuck with 128bit memory bus on consumer platform.,Negative
AMD,You are like literally a sock puppet account of his?  Your glazing of this conman is embarrassing.    Remember this is the guy who said that Zen 3 would have 4xSMT. lol,Negative
AMD,"Imagine if it ends up being Zen 6%, lol.",Neutral
AMD,4 core users always asked the same thing,Neutral
AMD,Encoding video,Neutral
AMD,"I mean, some games can take advantage of more cores very well. Cyberpunk is a good example, there was a bug where it would only use 6 cores on Ryzen and when I did a mod to enable the extra 2 cores I had a significant bump in performance",Positive
AMD,Yeah I'm curious too.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah like I said, they're almost certainly just binned identical CCDs, 8+8 and 10+10. But they don't have to be and there are reasons they could do something weird.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah I can definitely see those chiplets being rare as hen's teeth. If all the L3 is good, but 2/3 the cores are bad, something funny happened to that die. It's just a fun thought that is now finally (technically) possible if they're doing a full 1.5x of a typical CCD for Zen6.",Negative
AMD,4 cores is not too few to be useful in a gaming workload. There are still a number of Esport titles that really only load 1 or 2 cores in any significant way. Chasing high FPS in those titles comes to mind.,Neutral
AMD,"lower core counts would be useful for handhelds. For sub 15w gaming, you want as much of the power budget you can go to the igpu.",Neutral
AMD,Let's just call CPUs by EAN code at this point.,Negative
AMD,Ozempic ridge,Neutral
AMD,Yeah unless they add more ryzens   3 would have to be 6 core  5 would have to be like 8-10 and maybe 12  7 is either the beginning of dual CCD or 12 cores  9 is whatever is above 7.  I think the 6 core 100% makes sense as R3 cause the ryzen 5 has always been a half of a dual CCD ryzen 9 so lowest dual ccd 16core/2= 8 core R5,Neutral
AMD,"Why not keep waiting until Zen 8, by then the node shrink will be tapped out and be mature. Or wait until Zen 9, then Zen 8 will go on sale. Personally I'm waiting for Zen 10 myself, that may be endgame of AM6.",Neutral
AMD,I'm doing the same. I got a solid MOBO and RAM ~10 months ago and paired it with a used 7700x just for this moment. Can't wait for these to start rolling out!,Positive
AMD,"Pretty much, I also got a significant discount at time of sale. The 9800x3d was around $200 more, not worth it.  It will be good though, msi x870E board at the moment.",Positive
AMD,Hence why I mentioned 8 and 16 core. If they use 12 core ccds they would disable some cores for the 8 and 16 variants.,Neutral
AMD,"> Overall AM5 will remain an expensive platform to get into.  DDR5 wise, yeah. CPU wise, we have 7500F, 8400F or 9500F.",Neutral
AMD,"> Where’s the 7ghz zen 6 then?  AMD hasn't even announced a Zen 6 product yet.  > The 9090XT he made multiple vids on nearly a year ago.  That was clearly labelled as speculation on his part, IIRC.",Negative
AMD,"ALL of them might have easily been in the plans and cancelled the last moment.  That was especially obvious with 9950X3D2, which was practically announced by OEMs.  For a **LEAK** source, it's not a mortal sin to occasionally be wrong.",Negative
AMD,">What is with you and simping for MLID? You did the exact same thing in the intel subreddit a couple days ago.   Just reacting to irrational hate towards him.\ AFAICT he is by far the best source for leaks.\ If there are better ones, I'd like to know.  Credit where credit is due.",Negative
AMD,Show me at least one before him.,Neutral
AMD,"If I buy an Intel K490 CPU and a Z990 motherboard, I'll have 48 lanes. If I buy an AMD 10950x CPU and an X970e motherboard, how many lanes will I have? If I still have a total of 28 lanes, I won't buy the AMD.",Neutral
AMD,My C compiler will happily use as many cores as I throw at it.,Neutral
AMD,Please don't jinx it.  AMD can always raise the price to a line to their Threadripper prices.,Negative
AMD,Great times! Those had the build-in copro right? Wonderful time to start studying and working. I started with C end of the 80s (and later C++ and assembler). Between all the management now and then still programming in C# and C++ (and simd with AsmJit) on a new AMD. Still love all the new developments ( AVX512 is wonderful).,Positive
AMD,If you are going for an x3d cpu I assume it’s for gaming. There isn’t a game in the world that needs 64GB ddr5. Why spec it?,Negative
AMD,same here but i give even less effort and if something is wrong (which often is the case) i just tell them i used the AI tool they forced me to use. Many of my coworkers also do this and management are thinking of removing AI.   You can do the same.,Negative

AMD,Nah. You just have an obsolete computer.,Negative
AMD,Then you aren't allowed to complain about RAM prices.,Neutral
AMD,"That's nothing like it at all.... That's the dumbest comparison I may have ever heard, actually.",Negative
AMD,"Bleh, not really. Usually programmers can ""just"" design an app to dish out parallelizable tasks, which scales to any number of cores. This is already the case with video encoding, code compilation, browser processes.   It's much rarer in games because this kind of software design is hard and requires a fatass brain.",Neutral
AMD,We don't have games that use 8 cores still,Neutral
AMD,Very true.,Positive
AMD,50% increase in cores with 50% increase in L3 is a wash.  But that's also why potential 8 core variants with 48MB of L3 could mean great gaming performance improvements.  That's a nice improvement in L3 cache-per-core.,Positive
AMD,The extra 16mb of shared L3 cache is a nice bonus too,Positive
AMD,If the other 4 cores are working on background tasks then why do you care if they're on the same CCD?,Neutral
AMD,"The thing is that when expanded L3 cache is mentioned, it's almost always in the context of gaming because it's basically the only workload that takes advantage of it. High core counts are definitely useful in a ton of workloads, but having expanded L3 cache on all cores of a high core count chip isn't all that valuable.",Neutral
AMD,"Wow, it's almost like I addressed that in my post.",Positive
AMD,No.,Neutral
AMD,"Both might be ideal. Afaik most game engine still actually do most of the work on 4 threads, we didn't go far on that front, actually I would say a lot of recent games use a huge amount of cpu for basically nothing as physics, npc ai etc didn't improve much over the years. I would say 6 cores are now mainstream, not 8 cores.",Negative
AMD,"Not all workloads can be scaled linearly over more cores. In fact, basically every workload will have diminishing returns with core counts at a certain point. Even with the 6-8 core norm we have now, the majority of a gaming workload doesn't scale beyond 2-4 cores.",Negative
AMD,">Epyc customers are first, we get the cpu dies that aren't as energy efficient.  >Enterprise wants and gets more cores, we get more cores.  AMD is starting to differentiate their server vs client chiplets with the introduction of the dense lineup. Zen 6 is rumored to have the dense chiplets be the mainstream server offerings too now with the dense chiplets getting the full 4MB of L3 per core like the standard stuff get.",Neutral
AMD,They sadly won’t do this because it would cut into TR and Xeon sales,Negative
AMD,"These new chiplets allowing denser core configurations are 100% targeting servers, not gamers.  Speaking as a coder whose specialty is performance optimization. Amdahl's law is a simple math that can tell you much performance improvement you can get by adding more cores, and can help us understand diminishing returns.  Lets say 90% of an app's work will multithread perfectly. That is, if you run it on an 8 core machine, that work'll be 8x as fast as on a 1 core machine.  That 10% that can't multithread perfectly is dragging you down \*a lot\*. On an 8 core machine, your overall app will be running only about 5x as fast. On a 32 core machine, it'll run about 8x as fast.  Bump that number up to 99%: by 32 cores you are still only going 24x as fast. Games don't get near even 90%. Most software doesn't get near 90%.  So, outside of some very very specific games with embarassingly parallel workloads, a 24 core CPU will not really help gamers over a 16 core CPU. Pumping all your TDP budget into making 8 cores run as fast as possible with X3D is the real way to go for games and I don't see this changing in the next decade.",Neutral
AMD,"It's really not gonna be like that.  Today's games still dont even tend to scale well past 6 cores.    There are fundamental problems with trying to distribute CPU gaming workloads across loads of cores.  They just aren't that easy to parallelize, especially some of the heavier logic tasks that you want to keep pinned on a main primary core.  Stuff that is kind of fundamental for the game to function properly.",Negative
AMD,I can wait. 5950X will do fine. I had an i7 3770 from 2012 before. I think it will even take longer than Zen 7.,Positive
AMD,"That was when he had just started out, but anyway he's been more accurate than anywhere else, I'm not sure why you'd say he's a con man 🤷‍♂️  It's pretty much agreed that zen 6 is going to be 12 core ccd's, just come back here after it's been confirmed by AMD, I bet you won't.",Neutral
AMD,And we used to have a single core until the mid aughts. More parallel performance is always good.,Positive
AMD,Does not answer my question,Neutral
AMD,So nothing? Got it.,Negative
AMD,I can see use cases where from 6 to 8 cores makes differences. But I just dont know many use cases that going from 8 to 16 for example makes a meaningful difference for the price jump.  There is a point that the hardware is not the limitation. Its the software/developer that is the bottleneck. Multithreading is not a trivial thing in the development side.,Neutral
AMD,"Hmm. 4 esport cores and 12 left over for streaming encode? Maybe, but I wonder what demand would be like?",Neutral
AMD,"Right, but they're not going to pop a 16 core Ryzen 9 into one of those. A purpous built APU would be used",Neutral
AMD,"They're not throwing a full CCD into a handheld outside of something like Medusa Halo. A dedicated handheld chip (Z3 from Ryzen 500 series) would probably be used instead.  On the handheld front I expect a 6-core CPU, likely 3+3, and an 8-12CU iGPU and an Extreme SKU at 8-12 cores on the CPU (4+6 seems very doable) and a 16CU iGPU. Those GPUs should be RDNA4m but given how long they seemingly want to cling to RDNA3.X, it could also easily be that.",Neutral

AMD,"100% at most Ryzen 7's will be the full 12 cores, I could even see them maxing out at 10 cores just for Ryzen 7 so they can leave the full 12 cores as a Ryzen 9 just so they could price it higher, I could also even see them introducing the 20/24 cores as Ryzen 11's.",Neutral

AMD,I bought a 7700x at the start of AM5 and with the idea to upgrade to the latest X3D that my mobo will support eventually. I'll have to be patient. I'm also not going to be buying on release but with its cheaper. Just like many people bought 5800X3D after 7800X3D was released.,Neutral
AMD,"and when some of the 8 cores fail to meet spec they end up with 6 cores like the 5600x3d, that can keep happening up the stack  A 24 core dropping down to a 16 core because 4 cores failed just feels like mismanagement to me.  Everyone would be paying for those 8 lost cores, yet they could have subsidized every other chip by selling it as a 20 core",Negative

Thread synchronization has a cost, so if a certain workload needs a lot of it, there's a point where adding more thread makes performance worse.  Code compilation is single threaded, BTW. What you can do is compile several files simultaneously. Build tools generally do that automatically, assigning one file compilation to each CPU core.",Negative

They don't have more than 8 cores, hell, for the games themselves they only have like 6 cores available, as some of it it's reserved for the O.S.  I have read interviews of John Carmack, who is one of the smartest game devs in history, and he said multicore gaming is super hard. So, I believe him.  But also, once most PCs and game consoles have, say, 16 strong cores, I just don't see the devs not trying to make use of all that power at their disposal.

AMD,"Think about it this way: making a game *not* scale with single core performance but with multicore performance is next to impossible atm. There is always the „render“ thread.  Now the moment your game scales linearly with core count you don’t need to do anything to utilize 8 cores instead of 6, or indeed 24 cores and 48 threads. The issue is we still have the render thread and lots of other threads for AI, physics and whatever. And the only thing we can do with more cores is run more AI and more physics and whatever. So they can make games more detailed or realistic with more cores, but not render faster. In fact, often enough the middle of the road core counts clock a little higher and have better performance *per core* compared to the highend ones.",Negative

Again, Carmack isn't talking bullshit.  If he says it's hard, then what do you think the vast majority of game developers are gonna be thinking?  There has to be a worthwhile payoff for the work done, and that's just not at all clear here.  You can easily break a lot of things trying to parallelize CPU workloads in games, it's not just a matter of 'using more cores'.  The entirety of engine programming and how games work as a whole are still built heavily around the more demanding game logic work being pinned to a single core because that's how you get the most reliable and performant results.  It will take like a whole paradigm shift for all of game development for this to change, and I dont see where the motivation for that will come from.  Especially when game development is already so damn hard as it is, and developers hamstrung for time.",Neutral

AMD,Fortunately zen6 is coming with a 6 and 8 core variant. Those should be cheap enough and similar in price to the ryzen 9600x and 9700x. I was worried that 10 cores was going to be the entry point for zen6 and AMD was going to bring the prices way up. They probably will at the high end. I won't be surprised if the 24 core chip ends up costing 1200 to 1400 Canadian. By comparison the ryzen 9950x3d costs 950. I think with zen6 AMD is manufacturing both an 8 core and a 12 core CCD. There is no way the 6 core and 8 core parts are cut down 12 cores. Fortunately those massive core chips are practically useless and unnecessary since using that many cores is very difficult. We only need the entry level 6 core chips because those bring massive single threaded performance. The 12 core x3d chip is going to be very nice as well. The successor to the ryzen 9800x3d.,Positive

America and Europe need their own factories for making Dram among other chips I believe for prices to stabilize but I fear that unless some good person in Government says no way to these insane prices they don't have to so they won't lower the price, (they are making money).  You want to win America and Europe as a whole then you have to beat the competition, America has all it needs to produce Dram from the Earth right now and the chips Do Not have to be built with rare earth's if the process is changed and the concept changed as to its design for any country looking to start their own factories.

AMD,"Steve very briefly alluded to something that I want to bring up because I think some people have really short memories, and this certain something really bothered me.    AMD initially did not want and did not allow Ryzen 5000 series cpus to work on the 300 series chipset AM4 boards.  A lot of people praise AMD for the AM4 platform, but I do not think this is really deserved.    AMD has to release a bios ""blob"" to the motherboard manufacturers, who use that to make bios updates for their boards.  When Ryzen 5000 cpus were released they would not work on the A320, B350, and X570 boards.  BIOS updates for those did not exist, and it was AMd's fault.  AMD was giving the most loyal customers of theirs, the early Ryzen adopters, a big middle finger.  They wanted people to upgrade motherboards instead.    Ryzen 5950X review from HUB was on  Nov 5, 2020  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsfvRw74h30)  BIOS updates for the 300 series chipsets was announced in March of 2022 and started being available in May 2022.  [https://www.techpowerup.com/292955/amd-brings-official-ryzen-5000-support-to-300-series-chipset-motherboards-circa-2016](https://www.techpowerup.com/292955/amd-brings-official-ryzen-5000-support-to-300-series-chipset-motherboards-circa-2016)  That was a huge gap in time.  Was it really a technical issue?  I don't think it was.  AMD wanted people to upgrade boards, like what Intel does.  I think AMD's reversal of their initial decision was not done out of the goodness of their hearts.  The people who had 300 series chipset boards who wanted a cpu upgrade had to upgrade their board.  If you had to upgrade your board, why not consider all possibilities, as in why not also consider Intel?  LGA 1700 cpus were faster for gaming, so why not get one of those?  I think AMD realized people were jumping ship to Intel so they finally released the bios update to manufacturers.  The point is that they were not trying to do the right thing for their customers.  In my opinion they don't deserve so much credit for the long lifespan of the platform as everyone gives them.",Negative

I doubt the board partners were complaining about the prospect of people being forced to buy new motherboards, either.  In the end, what AMD wanted to avoid wasn't what their customer base wanted, so they had to take on the support burden to allow Zen 3 to run on those old AM4 boards with low BIOS capacity.",Negative
AMD,"Fact is, we don't know what reasons there were behind the scenes. We do know that the limited BIOS size has meant that support for newer CPUs needed dropping support for older CPUs. It is very possible that there were all of technical, marketing and sales reasons for the initial lack of support Zen 3 on older motherboards.",Neutral
AMD,This is a bit of revisionist history. AMD didn't want to allow mobo manufacturers to remove support of older cpus to allow the new cpus. This was 100% because of small bios chips that couldn't support every cpu. Eventually the backlash forced them to allow it.,Negative
AMD,You have to remember that AMD also had to keep their board partners. If they release new CPUs that don’t require a mother board upgrade then the board partners get upset because AMD gets more sales and the board partners don’t.   Obviously I as much as anyone don’t like this. I’d rather just upgrade my CPU if my board supported all the functionality. But businesses also need to earn money to stay in business.

AMD,"i guess i'm imagining the plethora of asrock boards that had bios updates made available that allowed the 300 series boards to have 5000 support essentially at/prior to launch... which kinda throws a wrench into the overall claim, leaving a combination of it being ""amds fault"" paired with board vendors.  there's something that needs to be addressed, and either willfully omitted or simply attempting to gaslight perhaps.... not sure, but if you're going to go to the extent of elaborating, odd that you'd make a point of neglecting to mention the variables at play and insisting on painting the purely negative picture you want people to ""remember"". One should be aware that as i mentioned, there were several bioses that launched in tandem with the ryzen 5000 series that were then immediately pulled, the reason, well of course it was entirely amd's fault, let's not consider the variables at play. Even for a small business doing deployments, things have to be validated and verified, a task that can take months to years depending on the context and circumstances. The same limitations and restrictions that applied to past sockets that allowed for significantly newer cpus that weren't initially even thought of had similar limitations and delayed bios/product support out of the box, some boards never to receive it because they never completely supported it. So let's play out the realistic circumstances of those variables, and this isn't in defense of a company that so many will immediately cast aside as fanboism or something, but the logic and reasoning for imposing a restriction in order for curb failures or catastrophic issues due to lack of proper testing and validation, or failing to perform up to the standards expected, nothing like getting hauled into court, potentially a class action lawsuit due to the newer cpus failing to operate properly as advertised on old initially released am4 boards, or worse, discovering that many were turned into paperweights, possibly loss of data among other hardware for blindly supporting it out of the box. It really bothers me that there's always the group of people, with the insane mentality that everything has a nefarious purpose and reason, that there isn't any logical or reasonable explanation beyond their own narrow mindset that it's always for the dollar, that there is nothing else making the decisions overtly. Do board vendors want to sell newer boards, definitely, no differently than a laptop manufacturer wanting to sell more laptops, the desire is for some form of obsolescence to occur, be it support or lifespan due to failure or whatever. NO one is discounting that as a significant variable, but the paint the entire premise that it's EXCLUSIVELY this is either pure ignorance at play, or willful intellectual dishonesty.",Negative

AMD,"One actual issue was the capacity of the BIOS for many of those older boards. The compromise was to remove support for some of the older APUs.

Honestly, it's a weak reason to deny a new generation of CPUs to an otherwise compatible chipset. I'm glad community push back convinced AMD to change their mind.

Oh man ... they had a good reason for it, that makes a lot of sense, if you see it from a company perspective. And no, it was not about money or being evil.  First of all, they never guaranteed how long the socket and chips would be supported. They wanted to try at least 3 gens or so, but as this was a whole new platform, nobody knew.  And here comes the kicker and the real issue, why it didn't work with the older boards - or better said, why AMD didn't want to support it on older chips.  When Ryzen launched in 2017, AMD suggested 16 mib memory for the UEFI - or at least didn't enforce more. When the 5000 series came upon us, this resulted in an issue, as they couldn't foresee at the time in 2017, that 16 mib are not enough to support the new CPUs. Or that they would run AM4 for so long with so many different CPU types. Mind you, they were almost bankrupt and Ryzen saved their ass.  So they had two options. Cut the old / first Ryzen boards and only support newer - with larger roms. Or risk a shit storm and support hell, if they support the older boards - BECAUSE PEOPLE CANT / WONT READ UPDATE INFORMATION. And just ask yourself who would've been blamed for it...  After the community forced AMD to give the old Chipsets the new CPU support, it happened as I said. People didn't read, upgraded their Mainboard and couldn't use their old 1800x anymore, because they ignored the warning, that the bios dropped support and there are two different bios. One for the new CPUs, one for the older ones.  Or they bought a new CPU, sold the old one already and couldn't boot to upgrade the Mainboard for the right firmware.  Don't you guys not remember the threads here about it? And I still remember how pissed some were because of it and what a shit show this was, from their perspective.  And AMD even had to resort to an RMA system, where they sent out older CPUs for people to upgrade the boards or newer ones, to downgrade. And this was all because of this issue.  AMD did not try to fuck over anyone or saw the possibility to screw people over. Yes, it's a company and not a charity. Yes, they need to make money,  enforced by the shareholders.  But please get the facts straight. Even back then everyone was raging about it and didn't even for one second think about it objectively and in regards of a company.

And before someone chimes one - you would've needed to delid your 13900 or whatever it was at that time and OC it to go against the 5800x3d. With a power consumption of like 300W vs. 100W. Dunno about the real numbers right now.",Neutral
AMD,It was very noticeable especially in cpu intensive games but 5800x runs super hot so get a better cooler if you do plan on getting it. I had a h100i 240mm on it and it would go past 100c on prime 95 (even with undevolting). I suspect the pump may have been failing so I got a PS120SE and it’s been much better now.,Positive

AMD,"This feels like why I don’t have many usb-c ports, because to fully back them it needs pcie lanes.",Negative
AMD,It technically does for X870/E as 4 lanes are reserved for the usb4 Asmedia controller. For every other chipset on AM5 it's 16(GPU)+4+4 as far as what most users would utilize the lanes.,Neutral
AMD,"Pedantic point:  Some of those PCI-E lanes go to the cost, others go to the CPU. The limits people were talking about were those going directly to the CPU socket.

AMD,"I believe that was a case of AMD wanting to avoid confusion, since it isn't immediately obvious without looking up specs which boards even had 32mb bios chips. Max was MSI's branding/series rather than part of the AM4 spec.  It's similar to the PCIe 4.0 on B450 situation. Some B450's could initially be set to use PCIe 4.0, but AMD had mobo makers release a bios update to disable this since it only could only be done on some boards but not others.  For the record, I also used a max board for my friend's PC build at the time.",Neutral

AMD,"AMDs $300ish 8 core desktop cpu on a $80 motherboard was at performance parity with Intels 8  core 6900k at $1000 on a work station board.   The 7700k was at the time a low end part with only 4 cores.   Yes, the CPU, which was basically rebadged to a low end i3 two product cycles later, happened to be faster in a few niches. Most of these niches didn’t matter to 99.9% of people. Want to game? Didn’t matter unless you had a top end gpu.   Heck even for gaming the i5 (4C/4T) was generally not as good at gaming as one r5 (6C/12T).   Intel had one favorable match up if you squinted really hard and disabled background tasks which caused lag spikes on 4C CPUs. The i3-i5 line wasn’t competitive. The high end work station parts were matched at a fraction of the cost.   And yes, the 8000 series, which had 50% core bump, rectified these issues later the same year.",Neutral
AMD,Meanwhile the 8700K is still somewhat usable today.,Neutral
AMD,A 8700K beat stock Zen3 by a fairly decent margin if you actually OCed it fully (CPU+RAM). in games it was a 5600x with worse stock performance and limited to pcie3.,Negative
AMD,"Yes, i had a 1700x system week 1 of release. For the first ~9 ish months, it was profitable to mine on just the cpu. And that was profitable after paying for power, so im not ignoring power cost. My power was not the highest, but it was above the national average.  The extra cores even allowed me to mine while i was playing games as well. Games didnt use the 8 cores, and depending on the game i could run 4 or 6 threads mining while gaming with little impact to frame rate. I would run however many threads would not impact gameplay. When i wasn't using the system i would use 8 threads.  I should also clarify. At the time, the value of the entherium was about the value of the just the 1700x cpu. So about $400 profit in 2017 dollars if i had sold then, but i did not. I sold the etherium at the end of last year at ~$4700/coin, and the cpu portion of what i mined was sold at a price that more or less paid for the system, sans peripherals.",Positive

AMD,ah understandable. The guy was trying to say you can't use multiple nvme with a gpu running at 16x which is false,Neutral
AMD,"Probably downvoting because the extra NVMe drives go through the chipset which just means that only one of them can operate at full speed at a time, but most of the time you aren't saturating PCIe 5 on consumer HW anyway. Games rarely benefit much from faster than 3.0 speeds.",Neutral
AMD,"No, it's more usual that a bunch of those NVMe share bandwidth through the chipset, but that hardly matters for the vast majority of consumers. Very few people on the whole are trying to run all their SSDs at full speed all at the same time.

Back in those days, they couldn't anticipate, how many years that support would go and how many different CPU SKUs they would release. Spoiler - it was a lot more than they could ever imagine. And that UEFI memory is not cheap and the MB makers would go with the lowest for some boards - and even higher priced ones, my 370x also only has 16 mib.

IIRC Hardware Unboxed alluded to one of the manufacturers considering legal action against AMD for this, and I'm sure it was MSI.  AMD also has a precedent of dropping support for products early - see Vega, the ""no more game optimisation"" for RDNA 1 & 2 drama, and the continuous silence regarding Redstone on older GPUs.",Neutral
AMD,cause if I manufacture something and know how much space xyz takes. Then know keeping support for xyz number of years. Then I know about what I need for storage.

I know on average my bio software takes 20mb of space (made up number). I plan to keep it for 5/6 generations. Then I know the bare minimal my specs should suggest is 160mb.

AMD,"ATI saved their ass with bulldozer. And the reason they couldn't win vs Intel was simply, because Intel made some shady backroom deals to keep them out of the OEM and Server market. And that was important, as this is where the money comes from. Back then AMD still had their own fabs and building new nodes was becoming expensive. With one the gamer and enthusiastic market as support, they didn't have the funds - thanks to Intel - to actually go toe to toe.  And this is not some conspiracy stuff, this happened. Mind you - at that time, Intel had more profit as AMD had sales. Intel was larger in sales as the next 5 companies in the same sector combined.  AMD got lucky, that TSMC steamrolled Intel and Intel fucked up their node long term. This gave AMD the upwind and time they needed to come back and overtake them. Showing people that they can deliver.  But in the bad decade with bulldozer, the GPU part saved their ass, but also bleed dry. They also had some strategy mishaps IMHO. But one of the main reasons, their GPU part is worse than Nvidia is, that they bleed so much knowledge and top tier engineers and devs, that it was impossible for them to keep at a high level.  And especially in this kind of sector you can't throw money at problems. It takes time to get devs and engineers back and them up to speed. Coding GPU drivers is everything, but not easy.  Also - many tend to forget - even today AMD is TINY compared to Nvidia or Intel. In sales, profit and employee numbers. And this was way worse in 2017, when Ryzen hit. Imagine half the employees of Nvidia and maybe 1/4 of Intel. And they had negative cash flow at that time, for years. And still doing GPU, CPU AND SOC for consoles.  Honestly, it's a miracle that they survived this till Ryzen hit and even could overtake Intel and get some serious foot into the server market now.  The only downside to them is, that they lack a good GPU lead with a solid vision and a larger software development team.  Also their PR team is the worst on the planet. They take too long to respond, tell way too much bullshit and so on.  They need some serious community managers in social media that can give solid answers, replys (fast ones) without clearing everything with the law department. They need to be way more active here and actually talk with people about issues. And even if it's only "" we are looking into it, it's a bad to find issue and we will take a lot of time to fix it"".

AMD,AM4 supported the last gen of bulldozer. When I got a 2200G rig setup I had to buy an A something or other cheapo part to get it so I could update the bios to add in APU support.

AMD,"CPU matters if it’s being choked. It barely matters if you’re above 100fps 99% of the time already.   A 4 core CPU had relatively little headroom for background tasks. Any anti virus spin up?

The cores in kbl were individually better than zen 1 cores for games. When they weren’t choking. Even 4C/4T without background tasks started to choke on just a game relative to the r5. So yes, 7700k if there were no background tasks, at 1080p, with the fastest video card at the time was the champion. Until it choked on real world use. Like a software update in the background.

AMD,"I didn’t realise they sold CPU’s on a platform that couldn’t even utilize the full spec.   Thanks for the insight.  Yeah I started looking this up and it comes down to how the motherboard is configured to handle this.  Which in your case auto negotiates down to x8 when you add the m2 drive.  That’s probably similar behaviour for even 9800x3D on boards with multiple NVMe slots and USB4 controllers.  I read about some other motherboards where they have a secondary full slot that only runs x8 natively so you can put the graphics card in that instead of the main slot if you want to force x8.  Some where they offer more NVMe slots but as you populate some it deactivates others etc. It’s a good point that maybe AMD didn’t see the issue as PCIE-5 has a lot of bandwidth so we aren’t close to saturating it for GPU’s.

AMD,7k had full 512 wide set for the crucial part while the rest ran at 2x256 bit. The 9k added full true 512 support. Most intel raptorlake laptop chips dont have avx512 fused off. There was a guy finding that the ecores can do avx512 with a custom microcode and bios bzt we never heard from him again.,Neutral

AMD,Upgraded my buddies system from a 1700x to a 5600x all on the same b350 mobo. He was playing xcom with a bunch of mods and the fps improvement was massive. From around 5fps to 20fps on the same gpu and ram.,Positive
AMD,"The 8700K was launched Q4 2017, by April 2018 there is the 2700X for $329. Zen+ has a significant clock speed increase and minor IPC increase due to lower cache latency. So except for a small window of time, the 8700K is not competing with the 1700X.",Neutral

AMD,"Nice, I'm tired of AMD rebranding old APUs and charging for them as if they were brand new.",Negative
AMD,What about 8060s? Though?  Who fucking cares about 890M? It’s made for business laptops…,Negative
AMD,I want Intel to win but sadly they only win against the HX370 which is a generation behind the 395+. So intel is still behind. They better price it well below the HX370 to regain market share. AMD lost the plot in terms of pricing and HX370 handhelds are well over 1300. If they can partner with MSI and produce a handheld for under 1000 they have a winner. Anything above that is DOA.,Negative
AMD,considering sr-iov and passthrough on linux are completely busted in the xe drivers for the B50 and that has been out for months it wouldn't surprise me if these are rough as well.,Negative
AMD,RDNA 3.5++++,Neutral
AMD,"Yes since they have this new loser as the head of client they don't build anything new. They just recycle old shit with new marketing name. I am sure he will kill the business in 2 years. Saving grace is AMD is untouchable right now for desktop, and Intel sadly is full of useless VPs that spend their days in meetings.",Negative
AMD,"8060s still comfortably beats out the B390, but it's designed for a different power class and draws a lot more power.",Positive
AMD,"The 890M is in the Z2 Extreme. It's not just for laptops, it's their prime handheld GPU chip.  The 8060S only starts beating the B390 around 33 W, making it unfit for a handheld device where battery life is very important",Neutral
AMD,the 395+ is a different segment of product imo. They start at $2200+ while the intel chips start around \~$1200 so far. The battery life also isn't even close.,Negative
AMD,Panther lake and 395+ can’t be compared the 395+ is a much bigger die and with double the bus they’re completely different tiers,Negative
AMD,"Strix Point and Strix Halo are the same generation, one is just much bigger and more expensive and for an entirely different performance tier. You're coming into a 5050 vs B580 comparison and saying that a 5090 is faster than the B580. Duh, of course it is.",Neutral

AMD,Which laptop is releasing at $1200 with the B390,Neutral
AMD,"Yes agreed, but if the machines offering them are in the same ballpark then it is a failure on intel. A machine sporting the B390 should be cheaper than an equivalent machine with the HX370. We need handhelds with B390 below the 1000 mark for example.",Negative

AMD,This seems like a significant outlier from what I can see and it's unavailable so unclear if it's an error.    I also can't see this on the hp website.   Guess we'll have to wait and see. From what I've researched the x /h processors are significantly more than the base,Negative
AMD,it's unavailable .....possibly it's a subsidized product.....,Negative
AMD,"yep, this  basically all the new B390 laptops lists around a same ballpark price as the 395+ ones  just over 2k USD",Neutral
AMD,"it ran out of stock a couple days ago. There's a few open box ones you can still pick up though. most of the panther lake laptops just aren't released yet. They might go up in price due to ram, but everything else will as well unfortunately.",Negative
AMD,"That is my point. Not worth the price if it barely beats the HX370. And just the fact we need to have this conversation shows how Intel Marketing miserably failed. If the B390 devices are cheaper, please make sure you plaster it everywhere and communicate it well. Even the people interested in it like me do not know or believe it.   Again if anyone at intel reads this, you better price this lower than the HX370 or you have no chance. I do not like AMD but sadly they have the best overpriced products right now.",Negative
AMD,this sounds about right.  Intel just said that the margins are PTL are below corporate average. which means yields on 18a are abysmal.  Expect prices to be high and supply to be low until yields improve (which the CFO head said wont be till 2027. But they should gradually improve through 2026.  AMD and intel are in a race. Intel need to improve 18a yields. AMD needs to get zen6 out. Whoever gets there first will be the winner. Until then it kinda looks like the laptop market is just a continuation of what it was before. AMD gets a slight pickup from the 400 series. Intel gets a slight bump from PTL.,Neutral
AMD,well why don't they restock it ??,Negative
AMD,"I would not expect them to care much about the DP4a version moving forward. It was a way for them to leverage themselves into the install base and get people to try it, but there's no real reason to keep investing in it.",Negative
AMD,"DP4a wont get any more updates, every major gpu manufacturer moved on to their ML-based hardware solutions.",Neutral
AMD,Why is there an image of XESS4? I believe the latest XESS version is 2.1 at least back in July 2025?,Neutral
AMD,This is not true. XESS-SR was updated to version 2.1.,Neutral
AMD,"AMDs upscaler in fsr 3 looks terrible. I have a legion go, and there isnt a single title where fsr 3 and their upscaler performs or looks better than just using LSFG... Let alone Xess with actual Intel hardware.",Negative
AMD,XeSS is still abysmally dogshit in ghosting as it received zero major model updates since 1.3.1. Intel might surprise us with a transformer model when celestial releases.,Neutral
AMD,Okay? They are also not releasing XMX upscaler updates,Neutral
AMD,Never say never,Negative
AMD,DP4a is ML based it just runs the instructions on GPGPU hardware.,Neutral
AMD,"It's XeSS 3 right now. At least everyone started to write XeSS 3 in the title, when they were talking about the recent MFG update",Neutral
AMD,The main focus of XeSS 2.1 was 2x FG for non-Intel gpus. For upscaler they had only small bug fixes and nothing else,Neutral
AMD,XeSS SDK 2.1.0 Introducing XeSS Frame Generation with Xe Low Latency support for non-Intel GPUs:  - Requires Shader Model 6.4 support - Standalone XeLL is not supported on non-Intel GPUs  XeSS Super Resolution Vulkan API Enhancements:  - Improved error reporting - Improved Vulkan validation layer support - Bug fixes and stability improvements,Neutral
AMD,Not my experience at all. Xess does better on non intel hardware with ghosting over fsr on amd hardware. Its about on par with dlss 4. Dlss4.5 is king though.,Positive
AMD,"The thing is that there isn't market for it.  DLSS has most people covered, Intel is doing their own solution, and AMD is trying pass the page on RDNA2 and 3 (which is a minuscule market to begin with).  Its a development that benefits no one.",Negative
AMD,You are correct yes but everyone knew what i meant. i think.,Neutral
AMD,"> The thing is that there isn't market for it.  That's short sighted. There is a huge swath of radeon owners that try XeSS, realize it's better than FSR, and then plan to get an Intel GPU for their next upgrade cycle (or sooner).  Especially since FSR4 isn't actually being put IN games, when XeSS has a back catalog and new games coming.",Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but you dont need to actively develop to get that effect.  FSR2 and 3 are booty and AMD is actively trying to sunset all older cards, so no future generations are subject to that phenomena.",Neutral
AMD,What’s insane is the IPC of the Darkmont E cores in Pantherlake seems to be better than AMD’s zen5 P cores.,Positive
AMD,"Now they just need to put this in a desktop package, slap some BLLC (Big Last Level Cache) on that mfer and we're talking. And by the time they've done that, Zen 6 is here. So we'll see. The end of the year will be interesting.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm very hopeful for Intel on this gen and Nova Lake I'm very excited about.    Intel in benchmarks though was always hit or miss due to cache issues and lack of avx 512. Canned benchmarks they did good on, but a lot of apps were starting to get avx512 optimized more and they would lose HARD there. Not only that but there were certain games where it was just catastrophic, and not due to windows e core issues.    Look at Homeworld 3 CPU benchmarks (I know it sucks).",Positive
AMD,Give me barlett lake for lga 1700. Its all I care about.,Neutral
AMD,"Great to see good competition, we need to wait for Zen 6 for more equal comparison (18A vs 2nm cores)",Positive
AMD,"AMD doesn't really have P cores  Great job Intel though, this is what we like to see",Positive
AMD,It's Mobile Zen 5 Cores that have lot less cache,Neutral
AMD,"Why? AMD still uses 5/4nm, that is a tech from 2020.  They can move to 3nm, and their performance will be in pair. They just did it to make as much profit as they can.",Neutral
AMD,Yeah. We gonna have a 28 core with bllc cache with novalake. They also making a 28 core with no bllc cache.,Neutral
AMD,"Intel has this golden opportunity to just rule the new DDR4 world while AMD plays pretend like people are still buying DDR5, but instead Intel wants to play pretend, too.  It's sad how stupid Intel's strategy people are.",Negative

AMD,still much bigger than darkmont E core,Neutral
AMD,18mb vs 16mb so a pretty fair comparison.,Neutral
AMD,The e-cores have no micro-op cache.,Neutral
AMD,"Except it's not as easy as cramming more transistors into the same space... You can increase perf/W that way, but not really an IPC, that's all about architecture.",Negative
AMD,"> They can move to 3nm, and their performance will be in pair.   A pure node shrink doesn't give you any IPC benefits. IPC is dictated by the underlying architecture. It might help their boost clocks and energy efficiency, but it doesn't improve IPC.",Neutral
AMD,Except we are running out of ddr4 stockpile and the prices are starting to reach parity unfortunately.,Negative
AMD,"TF? AMD literally just released 5900XT which is basically a renamed 5950X not too long ago and still selling. Also, don't bet on DDR4 as those prices are hiking too now.",Negative
AMD,He's saying mobile zen 5 has less ipc than desktop zen 5,Neutral
AMD,Panther Lake is also Mobile. So it’s a fair comparison.,Neutral
AMD,Yes I agree but does ipc differ between intle mobile and desktop with the same core?,Neutral
AMD,Spec is dependent on Cache size and Memory Latency outside the core IPC,Neutral
AMD,Yep,Positive
AMD,"Let's just wait for products to hit, maybe Intel is going to hit it out of the park, but they have a long way to go before I will trust their marketing slides.   AMD is no better in that regard, I'm not just shitting on Intel.   In all honesty, I'm pretty happy Intel is doing better on the iGPU side, cause it was so bad for so very long.   My laptop is currently an i7-1185g7, not their best showing, but was a step in the right direction on the iGPU side.   Not anything I would have bought brand new, but being a refurbisher in my spare time has perks.   My laptop is always 3-6 years old.",Positive
AMD,Intel's been down this road before. It's not worth it. 14900HX is the only reminder you need. How fast does it need to be before we start talking about just putting a GPU in? If I'm getting a laptop why would I get a power hog collapsing star? It's called mITX.,Negative
AMD,Spinning a delay of building a competitor into this? Good try,Positive
AMD,"To completely compete with Strix Halo (really just the graphics side) would require intel to increase the die size just like AMD did. In practice, even in gaming, it isn't worth it. Yes, you get between 20-30% more performance with Strix Halo up to 65W, and then pushing 80w+ Strix Halo opens up further to closer to 40-50% better performance. Thing is, it just doesn't make sense to create a large APU with those power requirements for full performance in today's market... especially at the prices of Strix Halo products. You can just get a solution with a dGPU at those prices.  I just wish Intel would push for Linux compatibility. Panther Lake is being held back by the suck that is current Windows 11 imo.",Negative
AMD,"Hmm, that's a shame.  I really like Strix Halo.  They're niche, no doubt, but with NVIDIA having DGX Spark, and AMD releasing a ""competitor"" later this year, kind of surprised Intel is going to ignore the compact AI development market.",Negative
AMD,"From what I've seen today on reviews, they really trade blows at different TDP ranges. I'm yet to see benchmarks that come out with the 70 something percent gains Intel claimed.",Neutral
AMD,"LPDDR tends to be more power efficient than GDDR, especially when shared with the CPU. Not to mention you lose less power to communication. In other words, an iGPU will always be more power efficient than a dGPU.",Positive
AMD,It still might not be a competitor because it's going to be expensive as hell. If one wants the bleeding edge chip they have to fork it out.,Negative
AMD,The 70% claim is against Strix Point which is the similarly sized offering from AMD. It only trades blows with Strix Halo because that's a far larger (and expensive to manufacture) chip whose gpu portion is as large as a desktop RX 7700. More cores at lower clocks means better efficiency.,Neutral
AMD,iGPU?,Neutral
AMD,"It’ll use less power, and it’ll do less work per watt too.",Neutral
AMD,"By ""this"" I meant the quote. As much as Pantherlake is great, I don't believe they were able to pull an AX launch off in time but simply didn't",Negative
AMD,It only trades blows at low power. Once you get higher wattages in it does not. But efficiency wise I think id trade my strip halo for an extra hour or battery gaming even with the lesser performance as I won't feel it much in the type of games I play. Panther Lake is a strategy gamers dream chip. Thin and light that can play the games at 1080p for 3 hours on battery.,Neutral
AMD,This is more based on die size than work per watt.,Neutral
AMD,Nah,Neutral
AMD,"I intended to say its large size was what allowed Strix Halo to also be competitive at certain low power ranges, at higher ones it completely dominates, you are absolutely right.",Negative
AMD,"Die size is going to limit channels more than anything though, right?",Neutral
AMD,Only 6yrs later than the M1 launch and about 9.5yrs after Intel learned that Apple was developing their old SoC independently.,Neutral

AMD,QCOM and their pipe dream of Windows on ARM are done for. There's literally no reason to buy a Snapdragon X chip,Negative

AMD,"lol this is like the 3rd time I’ve seen headlines calling something the windows answer to apple silicon. First it was the latest windows ARM, then it was AMD Strix Halo, and how its intel Panther lake. Don’t get me wrong, I’m stoked for Panther Lake, but it is diminished by their reliance on Windows for the operating system.",Neutral
AMD,I very doubt,Positive
AMD,Eh as per the article the only thing that stands out is the iGPU and that's it. The rest is on par with a mid-range Ryzen AI 7 350. And you pair that with a 5050 and boom: Double the FPS of the Intel.,Neutral

AMD,Same for me.,Neutral
AMD,"Seems like it got deleted, don't know why.",Negative
AMD,"Unless you want better battery life, reliable wake from sleep, better cpu and multi-core perf.   Apple proved you don't have to be gaming first to be successful.

AMD,"18A is not in the same league of N2.   Even 18AP is not on par with N2   14A is not ready  So unless they want inferior product to AMD (Zen6) which will be on N2, NovaLake will be on TSMC N2  14A is when Intel expects to match or surpass TSMC nodes",Negative
AMD,"Tell me you haven't watched the reviews without telling me. Lol ""better battery life"" has been QCOMs only argument vs Intel/AMD and now with Panther Lake's superior battery life, QCOM has nothing more going for it. The X2's efficiency is not going to be that much of any more than the X.",Neutral
AMD,"Snapdragon has no advantages. It is not cheaper, it is not faster and it does not have better battery life at equal performance.

AMD,Keep on dreaming. Numbers speak for themselves.,Neutral
AMD,"I've mostly been picking up AMD as of late, but this is a great win Intel's needed for years. About the only potential downfall is pricing, but given that AMD has nearly zero design wins for Strix Halo on laptop, Intel has a pretty wide open field to work in.",Positive

AMD,Argh! My mistake!,Neutral
AMD,Does it really that matter? I mean intel 12th and 13th  gen was on par or even better than zen3 and zen4 .  Both intel 12th ans 13th gen were on intel 7 or 10nm while zen  3 was 7nm and zen 4 at 5nm.  If anything I don't get how intel dropped ball so hard with arrow lake . Going from 10nm(intel 7) in 14th gen to 3nm of tsmc in arrow lake should produce both efficiency and performance gain like how nvidia got going from samsung 8nm to tsmc 4nm in 30xx to 40xx.,Neutral

AMD,Apple was also mad about margins. It cheaper for them to make their own than beholden to Intel’s pricing.,Neutral
AMD,"Where did you see that? I’m not aware of any regressions vs Lunar Lake, and Intel is specifically releasing a handheld sku to deal with the super low power : high gpu performance regime.    SKU differences aside, take a 388H and throttle it to 17W and it greatly outperforms lunar lake.",Neutral
AMD,"Intel 7 was competitive in peak performance, but lacked efficiency. Also note that arrowlake utilized N3b which was notorious for poor yield and over complexity and quickly replaced with N3e in Apples line of products. Arrowlake also followed the 13th/14th gen debacle and Intel reduced ring bus clocks significantly to play it safe.  Most notably, going from a monolithic design to chiplets leads to increased latency which reduces gaming performance and makes it harder to hold higher clock speeds.

AMD,"They were experimenting with tiles and it’s an early iteration. Not to mention they have more experience with their own fab.   Arrow lake smokes 14th gen in compiler workloads. Those faster e cores help a lot!   Outside of gaming workloads, it’s fine. Even with gaming workloads it does ok, just not a real jump from 14th gen. It was never going to beat x3d",Positive

AMD,This test does: https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/prozessoren/intel-core-ultra-x9-388h-test.95776/seite-5  It looses quite strongly against the 288v (which is not anymore that efficient and far less so than the Ryzen 7 350),Neutral
AMD,Any spec sheet will show you it will have only 4 cores for the GPU. Lunar lake has 8. Panther Lake cores would have to be twice as powerful as lunar lake which we know they aren't.,Neutral
AMD,Thanks for explaining,Positive
AMD,They still lose handily in efficiency and their multi core isn’t better than Strix Point,Negative
AMD,Not really. It loses against the 288v in the first test and wins against in the second test.  There is no direct comparison against the Ryzen 7 350 and I don't know how you even reached the conclusion that the Ryzen 7 350 is more efficient than lunar lake?  [Notebookcheck](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Panther-Lake-Core-Ultra-X9-388H-performance-analysis-Outpaces-Arrow-Lake-and-exceeds-Zen-5-in-efficiency.1212583.0.html) conducted fairly good efficiency tests that compare the single and multicore CPU perf/W. The Ryzen 7 350 is actually included in their list and ranks dead last in the multicore comparison so there's that and in the single core comparison Lunar Lake generally performs better than both but once again the Ryzen 7 350 is beaten by panther lake.  They even include a nice graph for different PL which also happens to include the Ryzen 7 PRO 350.,Neutral
AMD,"You are discussing SKUs. The reason lower stack PTL has fewer Xe cores is because they are nearly 2x efficiency.   However, should you take a higher SKU and configure TDP to 20W (or even 15W to account for external memory) it will be more efficient than Lunar. Lunar Lake is great, but PTL is much better.",Neutral
AMD,You'll see but not even in your wettest dreams the Ryzen will be beaten. Intel remains Intel after all.,Neutral
AMD,"It needs to be at least 2x as efficient to be as powerful because it has HALF as many cores. It isn't, therefore the GPU will be weaker. You can do that same TDP configuration on Lunar Lake. Not sure why that matters.  ""Nearly 2x more efficient"" translates to ""nearly as powerful"". But not quite.",Neutral
AMD,It is 70% faster. You’re comparing different SKUs. Compare top Lunar Lake to top Panther. How the TDP is configured is up to the OEM,Neutral
AMD,"We don't know how efficient those 28W Panther Lake chips run at 17W. Just because you can run it at such low power does not mean it will work well. It will certainly be much less efficient if it were to be run that way otherwise Intel would be gloating at how powerful and efficient their Panther Lake GPU is at 17W. The fact that they don't means it is well below their sweet spot of efficiency. You are basically starving it, similar to stalling an engine.",Negative
AMD,"The fact that it can even compare to AMDs halo product, which the avg consumer can’t afford is a win for Intel. Intel has plenty on leg room to expand the GPU too.",Positive
AMD,This suffers from bandwidth bottleneck. Strix halo is Quad channel while panther lake is dual. An igpu would benifit greatly with a quad channel,Negative
AMD,"This thing is absolutely nuts  AMD BTFO unironically, I'm floored. I never, ever would have considered an Intel chip before 2025, now this is the most obvious laptop part ever. AMD is surely sorely regretting recycling the same 780M and 890M chips for another entire gen, betting that Intel would continue stagnating.  This thing is gonna be a monster in handhelds.  I really, really wanted a Strix Halo laptop, but the lack of SKUs, price and the inflexibility with RAM kind of make it unappealing to say the least, not to mention the power draw compared to Panther Lake is unwelcome. These laptops are gonna be probably the best x86 in mobile has eaten in a very long time.  On top of that, it's almost making the 5050 look like a stupid part in a laptop.

AMD,Lunar lake is in sub 800$ laptops now and 12xe cpus are available for sale 1300$ despite the ram and cpu shortage.   The comparison is good even before likely price hikes for strix halo,Positive
AMD,"We’re talking mobile chipsets here, strix halo is what happens when you throw efficiency out the window, with Power (TDP) range, typically from 55W up to 120W. The ultra H 300 has default TDP of 25W, with Maximum Turbo Power (MTP) going up to 65W-80W. Intel has a better design, if they threw 40 XeSS3 cores on it, it would prolly run circles around Strix.",Neutral

AMD,"> It's got about as much bandwidth as it needs to feed the Xe3 cores.  GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them. It won't help EVERY benchmark, but it will help many.  I'd rather see 256-bit bus on something like this. maybe 192 since you can do that with LPDDR5X etc.",Neutral
AMD,">Panther Lake's GPU tile size is only 54mm^(2)  is this confirmed for the bigger tile?  edit: also, Halo has all the IO, en-/decoders, etc. in the ""GPU"" tile, so the comparison isn't quite valid",Neutral

AMD,"> (more than) half the price  Have we seen pricing? Not doubting it, I just haven't seen anything personally but probably missed it.  Strix Halo does seem to be a pretty mythical chip due to its price.",Neutral
AMD,Keep in mind that each Xe3 core is about as wide as an AMD WGP. We're looking at 1536 vs 2560 shaders. The B390 is 60% as wide as the 8060S. 20 Xe3 cores would match the 8060S in width. 40x Xe3 is as wide as the 7900GRE.,Neutral
AMD,"Bingo  Strix is also limited by being RDNA 3.5 and no FSR4, so it's rather dependent on raw throughput, and it can't possibly fit in a comfortable handheld that would last for more than an hour and a half under load.  I really, really appreciate what AMD has done historically in the APU space, but it is genuinely time for vendors to start considering Intel. The strides here are absolutely immense. They went from an iGPU being a thing that can do basic graphics and 2D gaming to something that competes against lower end NVIDIA parts at less power draw and can actually legitimately game. It's bonkers. In mobile it's a no brainer.  Of course, it's going to be interesting seeing AMD's next UDNA architecture and what they can pull off, but competition never hurt nobody, and it was sad seeing AMD stagnate in the APU space of all things, their bread and butter that gave them pretty much the entire console market plus the Steamdeck. The entire Windows and Linux handheld market has been nothing but AMD for years. This is even better than Lunar Lake.  We're getting to the point where Intel could legitimately compete in the home console space and make a really great product, but realistically they can't undermine AMD's relationship with vendors at this stage. I hope they keep it up, it would really be cool to see an AMD vs Intel APU console war generation.",Neutral
AMD,It's about 50% bigger die with 1 CCD (which seems comparable CPU performance),Neutral
AMD,https://youtu.be/X9eYQTkzxqU?si=Uzdz-E3QJzzVM42N  Not the only one comparing. Intel actually outperforms at lower wattage.,Neutral
AMD,">GPU's will take all the bandwidth you can feed them.   Didn't deny that. But 12 Xe cores is presumably considered the sweet spot, that's all I'm saying. And Strix Halo only has twice as much bandwidth to feed a GPU die 6 times the size of Panther. I'm sure it has more cache, but still. I think Intel would consider triple or quad channel memory not worth the costs. It would require new i/o, new pins, new motherboard, more RAM, and all, for what's essentially the lowest volume product.  Besides, Intel already has Nova Lake AX in the backlog, or whatever it's going to be called. Practically intel's strix halo. It'll have Xe3P cores, more powerful than Xe3, thus deemed more worthy of the halo treatment.",Neutral
AMD,"This is a big of exaggeration, as you can see with Nvidia moving to gddr7. While bandwidth has increased substantially, performance is clearly limited by lack of compute power",Negative
AMD,"No official confirmation yet, but JayKihn leaked the tile size for the 12Xe SKU last year. Another user somewhere else said the 4Xe GPU is 33mm2.   https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1812898063502938260   And even without the PHYs and NPU, from what I see, Halo's GPU tile is still like almost 3 times as big.

It's only 2x the fps (and who knows, panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus, but we'll never know, because Intel won't release a strix halo competitor)",Neutral
AMD,"Halo's die is still quite a bit bigger, but from the Intel side, you need to include IO, GPU and about half of the compute die which has the MCs, encoders / decoders, etc. to match the ""GPU"" die of Halo, so it is more like 200mm² to 300mm² when compared",Neutral
AMD,AMD is paying more attention to NVIDIA for sure. ESP on the data center side.,Neutral
AMD,">much larger Xe3 GPU's exist.  The biggest one for the moment is on Panther Lake X CPUs.

But all I need to know is it's faaar bigger.  >panther lake could be 2x its own fps with doubled memory bus  That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.",Neutral
AMD,"Well Panther uses mixed processes, and hybrid tiles are bound to be a bit less space efficient than putting everything on a single die. And to be fair, Halo GPU uses N4P process while Panther GPU uses N3E So, still not directly comparable.   Gotta say though, Arc's PPA has improved a lot since Alchemist and Battlemage.",Neutral
AMD,"> That would be within Strix Halo territory. I highly doubt it. A GPU with bigger bandwidth will access things and perform raster operations faster, but it won't get much faster at actually processing vectors and other calculations. Gotta need more cores for that.  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much memory bandwidth you have if the GPU doesn't have the raster performance to keep up with the flow of data. Case and point, AMD's R9 Fury X. Released with 4096bit bus HBM. Had a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/s. Yet the GTX 980 Ti released with a 384bit bus and 336GB/s memory bandwidth and it out performed the Fury X in pretty much everything.

AMD,"The SKU count is roughly doubled because you have each step with/without vPro - these get a 100MHz max turbo frequency bump, but the main benefit is you can run the corporate firmware with vPro support, so you get additional security and manageability features. Exception is the Ultra 9 where they just do it with vPro support as standard.  These have a higher cost because you are getting more features.  You could make it so you just have one CPU and then the manufacturer pays a license for corporate firmware per device, but that's more work to then ensure manufacturers are licensing machines correctly, and more confusing for end-users where now if you're buying a corporate device with vPro support you know you are looking at Core Ultra 236V and 268V for vPro support whilst 226V and 258V don't have it.",Neutral

The handheld chips running downclocked GPUs get the B360 and B380 names as well. Those should all be Core Ultra X.  As of right now only the ending 8 differentiates the 338H from the small-GPU SKUs, which IMO is not clear enough. Also, if the X became the standard for all big-GPU chips, that ending digit can be used for something else, such as noting the actual GPU performance within the stack.

And chiplets carries an area penalty over monolithic designs anyway.   >The removal of Hyper-Threading from the Lion Cove P-cores is the most contentious yet logically sound decision engineers could have made given the thermal constraints of modern silicon.   This makes no sense   >By removing the simultaneous multithreading logic, specifically the duplication of architectural state and the complexity required in the reorder buffers and schedulers to handle two threads, Intel was able to physically widen the core and increase the L2 cache per core to 3MB without blowing up the die size  SMT costs Zen 5 less than 5% in area btw. Just throwing that out there.   >The result is a P-core with significantly higher IPC than Raptor Cove  It's not though. This has been a significantly worse ""tock"" in terms of IPC uplift compared to something like SNC or GLC.   >but this raw single-threaded throughput is being masked by the interconnect latency.  Maybe gaming or some benchmarks are, but for the large part, no.   You can see this two ways, LNC's structural gains (core width, ROB capacity, etc etc) have smaller gains, percentage wise, over their predecessor versus something you would see in GLC vs SNC, or SNC vs SKL.  And also LNL's uncore is dramatically improved over ARL, and yet you see the same unimpressive IPC gains over MTL/RWC (which is the basis for ARL's mid mem fabric).   >the architectural overhead of the Foveros packaging means that ring bus latency is higher.

AMD,Designing a consumer product line around the niche of top of the line workstation is not a good decision for the average consumer.  I only once met a person with video production workstation that has more than an I7 or R7.  Previous gen I5 were amazing combo of multi core and single core . They rivaled amd r7 in preformance .

AMD,"AMD had a very similar experience with their first generation of Ryzen CPUs. One of the differences here is Intel had a competitive product prior to their architectural shakeup. Had Intel totally croaked for years and not been competitive in the CPU space the narrative would be completely different and everyone would be singing their praises.  Aside from that I think the biggest problem with this new architecture is simply there's little reason to buy in. It was only recently (if memory serves, I could be wrong on this) announced that the next generation of CPUs will share this platform and later ones will be on a new socket. When AM4 was announced we knew that it would persist for multiple generations and now with AM5 - why would you buy a board that will be obsolete when its time to upgrade when you could buy into a platform that will support your next 1-2 CPUs? Especially with the old intel socket performing just as well on a more mature platform, for most end users this first core ultra series just isn't worth investing.",Neutral

AMD,"IMO corrupt tech sites and tech YouTubers are behind ARL’s failure for two reasons.   The first: AMD MCM processors without 3D cache are bad for gaming, and it’s hard to find this information in 90% of charts to warn intel about the consequences of going down this path, even though they should have done their own tests and experiments.   The second: in my own tests, the 265K was 15% faster than the 9700X on launch BIOS. Through BIOS updates, that gap extended to 20%, making it only 7%-10% slower than the 14700K. Yet on some very questionable charts, the 265K is shown as slower than the 9700X.   For experienced users, RPL CPUs’ temperatures can be lowered by 20°C by turning Hyper-Threading off and undervolting. For inexperienced users, ARL is better, as it runs 20°C cooler out of the box.   I believe that in 2026 we deserve raw, unedited video benchmarks that start from the desktop, show full system specs, then enter game-by-game benchmarking—no more charts with zero evidence to back them up.   When I tried to confront HUB with my benchmarks, I got blocked to cover up their lies and corruption. If they truly cared about which CPU is faster, they would share their in-game benchmark scores and discuss them in a scientific way, but that’s not their goal. The numbers go up and down for the highest bidders.   Lastly, I believe Nova Lake, with its expected 144 MB cache, will be faster than Zen 6 X3D by 10–20% as 9700x in real world is 20% slower than 265k and if both got the same IPC uplift NL will end up on top.

Next is the most important is Everything just works. The boot is faster. wakes from sleep. its a more mature. I have another amd pc with r5 2600, where I found some stability issue.

AMD,"285K seems to have fantastic workstation performance, I didn't think much before selecting Intel over AMD parts for work to be honest, considering the efficiency gains. We landed on 265K, it benches very favorably compared to AM5 parts in nearly every workload except for gaming, and even then, that's mostly the X3D parts, and even then, that's when there is virtually no GPU bottleneck.   Most initial ""gaming"" reviews were done exclusively with 5090s, which is extremely unrealistic for most gamers and gave an extremely false impression that you would see a massive uplift by buying this part compared with the alternative CPU parts in gaming.   A lot of reviewers such as HUB have done a lot of work to correct this impression with a variety of testing scenarios and explaining their reasoning behind removing the GPU limiting factor as much as possible in benchmarks. Incidentally, these reviews typically showed that anything less than a 5080 sees virtually no benefit with a 9800X3D versus, say, a 9700X, and incidentally the two parts that saw no discernible benefits were the Radeon 9070XT and the 9070.  Obviously, if you have a 5090 and an unlimited budget with price being no factor, your best bet for top tier performance in all categories is a 9950X3D, but that just isn't what most people are looking at.  I myself bought into the future proofing mentality with my CPU and bought a 9800X3D, and ironically bought another AMD Radeon 9070XT to pair it with, a GPU that seems literally no performance gain compared to a 9700X, let alone a 285K. The same 285K that takes a dump all over the 9800X3D in nearly every other productivity benchmark.  I guess the good news is that when I upgrade my GPU in 2-4 years, at least I'll take advantage of the 9800X3D in games, lol. But considering it cost me over $900 for CPU, RAM, and motherboard, that's cold comfort.

MTL releasing in Dec 2023, internal testing I'm sure yielding some set of data, and external reviews giving other feedback, even by the release of MTL, ARL has probably been in the pipeline for years and probably locked into certain design choices regardless of the feedback and testing.  Additionally I suspect that on mobile chips/laptop gaming rigs there's less focus on each individual part because  a) few people hardcore game on laptops b) the latency can be blamed on other things since laptops are a prepackaged consortium of parts and it's harder to isolate, and  c) therefore laptops tend to be evaluated as a whole rather than the individual pieces that comprise them.   Therefore the ""latency issues"" only became a massive kerfuffle when the offending cpu could be isolated and tested alone, and reviewers needed something to complain about.   That's even if Intel was considering latency as the issue everyone made it out to be. Intel could have looked at it and considered the latency worth the cost to improve in other areas and serve as intels seminal desktop entry utilizing disaggregated silicon. Then gamers came and lost their shit that the newest Intel chip deprioritized something that impacted their precious fps- even though the impact was ""the new one is approximately the same to maybe a little worse as last gen in most games"".   Notwithstanding the fact that the 200 series chips retain healthy gen-to-gen perf uplift and a _massive efficiency improvement_ in productivity and general computing, and boosting the NGU and D2D clocks (which are _very_ low from the factory, and can be done with the app that Intel _has specifically designed for tuning their chips_ and is freely available (XTU)) brings the gaming performance to ""approximately the same to a little better in most games"". Contrary to what some people may think these chips are not solely or even majority used for gaming and there are other use cases Intel can to think about/chose to prioritize.   To be fair, gamers and tech enthusiasts are the ones who will care the most and therefore have a disproportionately large impact on the kind of publicity the chip will get. So, was this intels smartest PR decision? Maybe not. But I think it was still a sound engineering decision, regardless of whether or not they had feedback or data on the issue, even if it didn't go over very well with their loudest customer base.  And this is all overshadowed by the fact that if you stuck even the most hardcore of gamers on a blind trial and told them to identify what kind of chip they were gaming on, I have a hard time believing any of them would be able to tell with any certainty which is which.   Once you get to 60 fps, the vast majority of people stop caring. Whats five fps going to do to radically change your gaming experience so much that it's unplayable? Which brings me back to one of my original points: If you care _that much_, you can go spend your money _elsewhere_.",Neutral
AMD,"I'm aware of CHIPS.  Like I said, I want Intel to be competitive. I hope if their new layouts mature into something that can retake marketshare that the same care will be taken to preserve AMD. AFAIK, no one came to lend them money or sign large multifaceted partnerships at that time. This ""must save Intel,"" movement is something that is borne out of how big Intel is. They're too big to fail, it would have too many implications for the economy. It's not tit for tat, but as they are both American companies and AMD has significantly more invested in my country, I don't feel particularly motivated to help bail out Intel when they have the equivalent of the iron rice bowl rolled out for them at the moment. I'll buy what works best for my needs at the time I'm buying, as always, and if Intel can make a better gaming focused, with some imagery stitching on the side, processor than AMD can at the time I'm buying, that's the direction I'll go.  Ultimately the 200 series is what the Ryzen 1000 series was, but more stable as Intel has always had better support both internally and from vendors. I have no doubt Intel may catch AMD.

AMD,"Let me explain why it will not degrade my CPU.  1. **TVB (Thermal Velocity Boost) is disabled when I set the turbo limit.** 2. **Current is not the issue.** First, even Intel chips were failing at idle. Second, you stated that ""the same power limit at lower voltage necessarily means more current."" That is incorrect, if it drew more current, then why does lowering voltage reduce power consumption? Have you missed basic physics? 3. **CPUs follow a voltage-frequency (V-F) curve.** The main issue was that either the CPU or the motherboard was supplying excessive voltage, or the CPU was requesting too much. Higher voltage is required for extreme single-core boosts, such as 5.9 GHz. This is why i3 and i5 CPUs were not affected. When I limit my boost and apply an undervolt, the CPU no longer requests high voltage. It might request slightly higher voltage for 5.5 GHz, but that is nowhere near the voltage required for a 5.9 GHz boost. 4. **The same principle applies.**  Its seems you are a failure of high life form.   Maybe read here more. it was already to high voltage   [https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Intel-Core-13th-and-14th-Gen-Desktop-Instability-Root-Cause/post/1633239)  Maybe you havent read much. if you undervolted only using AC/DC loadline and didnt limit max frequency.

I fail to see how we went from talking about a failing architecture, which I don't think of Intel's product line as, to the whole bailout discussion. Maybe because I said AMD didn't get bailed out? I think maybe you forget that AMD had to offload global foundries, I don't think anyone even blinked when that happened and it's likely because that was a different era.   My post had nothing to do with the bailout versus architecture (or saving it) , apart from mentioning that I don't believe as a consumer I should feel motivated to buy Intel over AMD, or any other American firm, at the moment.   To be very clear, as this is personal for you, I do own Intel equipment including an Arc graphics setup for one of my children. I'm not anti-Intel or anti-American at all.   I know the history between AMD and Intel fairly well. Oversimplifying, AMD as it is doesn't exist without Intel. AMD only grew because they were the most successful second source producer for Intel, and the most successful at riding the thin grey line between patient infringement and unique implementation of similar IP that kept them alive while everyone else in the X86 space either died or became irrelevant to the consumer or enterprise space. After Itanium, the story levels out with both companies becoming effectively unwilling AMD64 codependents, and I'm saying that humorously.   Intel would gladly own the X86 market outright. So would AMD. At the end of the day, we need the two driving innovation through competition. Even if the CHIPS Act, the government stock acquisition, and the nVidia partnership are solely aimed at bringing more, needed, chip manufacturing to the US, it could create a situation where that amount of leverage puts Intel into a hyper dominant position again in the near future.

Broadwell-E and early Skylake also weren’t great for OC.   -Once the node matured, things improved again. Coffee Lake (refined 14nm) made 5 GHz relatively easy. The same pattern repeats with 10nm: Alder Lake (12th gen) came after Tiger Lake and could already reach ~5 GHz, while Raptor Lake pushed clocks even higher, up to ~5.7 GHz.

All the other crap they test in various reviews are mostly meaningless to the actual user. There is a very small %age of the market for high power/perf laptops and even smaller market for gaming.   Most of the reason a laptop is “slow” is bloatware and has nothing to do with the cpu choice anyway.  And Intel is already “beating” AMD in laptop cpu sales, by a substantial margin. People incorrectly assume AMD has most of the market share in all segments because of the very noisy and super-biased gaming reviewers, who mostly focus on $3000+ gaming desktop builds. Yes AMD is handily winning there.",Neutral
AMD,"I have a T14s Gen 5 Core Ultra 5 135U and recently I saw \~9h of battery life, browsing websites. It's quite nice piece of hardware so with Lunar Lake it would be just perfect. Of course not for heavy workload because for this we will have Panther Lake. I work in tech for years, not an expert in laptops area but I can assure you that new CPUs from Intel that I mentioned earlier are way, way, way better than previous generations.",Positive
AMD,"I've gotten one and honestly it's amazing, easily the best laptop I've ever used so far.   I was skeptical about the battery life claims but I've genuinely found that using it for about 8 hours straight for coding, only drains the battery maybe 50%.  I've set it to only charge up to 80% max for battery health conservation, and I've regularly coded for 12 hours straight on the medium performance profile and haven't needed to charge until I got back home.  (This is for the Ultra 7 258v cpu variant btw)  Also this is while running Fedora with KDE Plasma which makes the battery life even more impressive as it's one of the heavier distros running cutting edge hardware and I've heard that Linux has less battery optimization compared to windows.    Screen isn't anything to write home about but the 100% srgb one looks good enough and is bright, 60hz looks kind of bad but I know that it saves a lot on battery.   Keyboard feels very nice as far as laptop keyboards go, having it be easily swappable is lovely as I wore out the keys on my old laptop, and I want this thing to last.   Linux hardware compatibility is perfect so far, even the fingerprint sensor works out of the box on fedora.   My only real complaint is that the plastic it is made out of is a major grease magnet and if I touch it without having immediately washed my hands, even if my hands weren't dirty, it'll leave dark patches from oils. Also it would be nice to have swappable RAM but I think 32gb ought to last a very long time anyway.   Genuinely seems like arguably one of the, if not the, best laptops for actually getting work done. Maybe it's not as fancy or sleek, but it just works. It's like the 2001 Toyota of the laptop world, it's not winning prizes for looks, but it'll never die, gets good mileage (battery life), and is easily repairable. Maybe not the laptop you want, but definitely the one you need (excluding people who need something like a dedicated GPU or really need super high CPU performance).",Positive
AMD,"Intel beats AMD in software (drivers, firmware) … I got think pad 780M laptop by company I work for. Randomly display won’t get detected. Randomly audio device goes missing. Not fun thing to reboot your laptop and miss 10 minutes of meeting.",Negative
AMD,"Soldered RAM sucks.  Nothing beats popping out the standard 8GB stick(s) a notebook may come with, installing a couple 2x32GB sticks yourself and having it actually work.",Negative
AMD,lol. Even in the cons it says weaker multicore than AMD….?   This article seems like AI wrote it,Negative
AMD,"Unfortunately Intel abandoned the on-package RAM after Lunar Lake again, which is the primary reason for the great efficiency and low power usage. I kind of understand why, it's expensive and not very flexible, plus apparently the market doesn't actually care that much about long battery runtimes. Only a small minority of people are ready to pay premium for this.",Negative
AMD,At work we are a Lenovo shop and recently swapped from Intel to AMD T14 laptops. Too many issues with Intel and the AMD models offer the same performance for less money.,Negative
AMD,Suck at gaming.,Neutral
AMD,Try a modern mac and tell me its not the CPU holding the UX back. It's all about the cpu's.,Neutral
AMD,"That would be nice. We have a bunch of laptops with Intel's i5, 13th gen I believe it was. 2 p-cores, some e-cores. They are all slow as fuck. I mean it. The CPU is so extremely slow and goes into tdp limit right away. Most users hate them.  Battery life is ok, but they are really bad in terms of performance.  So - I wouldn't say CPU doesn't matter.",Negative
AMD,"AMD is held back in laptops by some shady deals of laptop manufacturers with Intel. It's impossible to get a 4k AMD laptop with 5090 for example, all of those are Intel (I found literally one AMD laptop like that compared to 25 from Intel). That's utterly ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,Isn’t the keyboard one of the most important characteristics?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, so much of laptop performance is dictated by things other than the cpu. Its kinda wild.   Intel does a way better job getting good laptop designs. Amd historically has just been a cpu seller, telling oems to go wild and do whatever . . . And it always ends very badly.   The biggest sign amd is taking share is not cpu benchmarks, but will be things like having premium screens, good thermals, lack of bloatware, dual channel memory, good SSDs, good colors, etc etc. and . . . ACTUAL AVAILABILITY. I dunno how many reviews i see where they review and intel and amd parts. Usually there is some way intel has a better premium finish. And then amd just has zero ways to actually buy their model. Its the weirdest thing.",Negative
AMD,"Hey I’m looking at the exact same laptop that you have. Can you tell me about the build quality and if there’s any keyboard flex when pressing down on it? Please tell me. I’m going to use it for word, excel, reading lots of pdf files and ebooks and watch movies. Will it be enough for that?",Neutral
AMD,Omg a positive review for Intel Lunar Lake 😭  https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/s/RYInPJfnAd,Neutral
AMD,"But haven't you heard, AMD beats Nvidia slightly at linux gaming benchmarks.  That means AMD has the best software support.",Positive
AMD,"I miss the times when laptops were far more upgradeable. I got a budget laptop for college with a low-end dual core, a spinning HDD, and 1 stick of 2GB RAM. By the time I retired it ~6 years later I've upgraded the CPU, replaced the HDD with a SSD, and added 2x4GB sticks of RAM. I also could've swapped out the network card and even the DVD drive for another SATA drive, but never got around to those.",Neutral
AMD,Soldered ram is a lot faster. So no.,Neutral
AMD,Yes but now RAM costs a ton of money,Neutral
AMD,Is multicore performance the only consideration when buying a laptop?,Neutral
AMD,What kind of issues?,Neutral
AMD,What kind of issues with Intel? I thought it was the AMD that had tons of issues,Neutral
AMD,It is not a gaming laptop,Neutral
AMD,"Yep. More specifically, it's mostly the single thread performance and efficiency.  It's how a MacBook Air can be fanless, run super fast, and stay cool at the same time while you're doing work with it.",Positive
AMD,It's an enterprise grade product you buffoon.,Negative
AMD,Exactly. Thinkpads are not targeting average Joes. They are targeting business and enterprise customers. Their Yoga and Ideapads are targeting the regular Joes.,Neutral
AMD,Build quality.    Thinkpads are solid machines that are easy to fix.    It's one of the few laptops that comes close to MacBook quality and everything judt working.,Positive
AMD,"So build quality will be subjective, from what I can tell, it's got very good build quality in terms of ""real"" factors such as durability. But it definitely feels less ""premium"" than similarly priced consumer grade laptops. The plastic is plastic so it will flex a little bit, but the parts all seem very well put together and it does feel ""solid"" overall.   I haven't really noticed keyboard flex, but I have noticed a slight amount of flex where my palms rest, particularly on the right side, where the smart card reader is, which makes sense as it is just a big hole in the side of the laptop. I plan on getting a dummy smart card to fill the gap and hopefully that should reduce it.   Overall whilst the internal chassis is metal, the outside is just plastic. I imagine that is good for durability, as it ought to be able to absorb shocks, but, as I said, it definitely makes it feel less ""premium"". They key press feel of the keyboard definitely does feel very nice as far as laptops go though. Obviously it's still nothing compared to a good mechanical keyboard but for a laptop it's very nice.   I bought this laptop for longevity and durability, so given that It's only just come out, I can't really say much about that, but the prestige of thinkpads of previous generations kind of speaks to their reliability. Plus it's apparent that they are still quite easy to repair and Lenovo has video guides on replacing loads of the parts.   And for your use case the battery life should be very good. It seems the Intel chip was designed to be very efficient during periods of downtime and something like viewing a PDF or editing a document has a LOT of downtime for the CPU",Positive
AMD,"Because only on Linux, Valve heavily funds AMD driver development and they also get other community contributions. The commonly used RADV vulkan driver was started as a community effort without AMD involvement.",Neutral

AMD,"The question is, is the soldered ram you're buying in a laptop faster than the ram you can buy and install yourself?",Neutral
AMD,All the more reason to make it upgradable,Neutral
AMD,Lunar Lake isn’t how Intel beats Amd lol. Panther lake will stop a lot of the bleeding for sure. AMD is so far making mostly good moves and Intel is as well with LBT. The goal for Intel over the next 3 years is stop losing customers base. I will point out Intel still has about 75% of all x86 customers.,Neutral

AMD,Thank you so much for this valuable and comprehensive information! I really appreciate it:),Positive
AMD,"Usually yes, soldered ram will be faster. And in case of lunar lake, it is faster and more efficient due to it being packaged with the cpu. Like Apple's unified memory.",Positive
