Intel,"I recently picked up an MSI Claw 7 AI+, and have been pleasantly surprised with the current state of their drivers. I would absolutely be interested in a Celestial GPU if they have anything targeting 9070~ or higher performance level. Here's hoping!",Positive
Intel,I'm glad they are doing these followup videos. Gotta give Intel credit where due - their cards are getting so much better over time.,Positive
Intel,The Lunar Lake handhelds would be really popular if they were just a little cheaper.,Positive

Intel,"They usually do tho? We dont know about their dGPUs yet because it hasn't been 5 years.  Their Xe Laptop gpus are 5years+ and are supported as of this month.  No idea why you're hating on intel GPUs mate, i'm used to everyone cheering the underdog not the otherway around.",Neutral
Intel,"I think that guy's a misinformed user that is saying that AMD 5000/6000 series won't get driver updates anymore lol, when AMD just said that those gens aren't slated for game optimizations that use their ""latest technologies"" (FSR4 at the time of writing) anymore. Those gens still will get driver updates but AMD gave up on trying to implement FSR4 on them, like the leaked scripts earlier this year had performance reduction from 20% to up to 30% FPS to use FSR4 for 6000 series cards since they don't have the hardware and just using brute force software for FSR4.   I'd agree that my 6700 XT never getting FSR4 sucks, but the misinfo circling around is that we'd never get anymore driver updates lol.",Negative
Intel,"so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding? and they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name? … but Xe3 plus will be enough to call it C series.",Neutral
Intel,"I loved how Tom Peterson did the circuit of tech blogs, tubers, and related last Fall to announce and advocate for ARC Battlemage.  Looking forward to seeing alot of him over the next few months for Xe3 and ARC C-series",Positive
Intel,Everything about Celestial I've heard seems to be regarding mobile. Is there actually going to be dedicated discrete graphics?,Neutral
Intel,The Intel driver downloading a shader cache for games from Intel sounds very noteworthy.   I'm really skeptical tying GPU drivers to a manufacturer's online service.,Neutral
Intel,"They don't care. These will be mid tier chips at best. The RTX IGPU ones will be their flagships. These are still damn impressive though, just have to make that clear.",Negative
Intel,"The mega brains of this community really struggle with product naming lol, its so funny to watch supposed intelligent people straight faced say they can't work out what product out 6 to buy because of their product names, most of them are in different market segments so you can't even accidentally buy the wrong one.",Negative
Intel,"They may divide ABC depending on ISA/hardware capabilities used for example. Like AMD used ""RDNA 3.5"" on mobile as full RDNA 4 would pull more power due to more silicon dedicated to AI (including FSR 4 -\_-). RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4. So Xe 3B will be better than current but Xe 3C will do better at DXR and/or AI frame gen/whatever new tech they added.",Neutral
Intel,"This will help you to understand: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intels-xe3-graphics-architecture-breaks-cover-panther-lakes-12-xe-core-igpu-promises-50-percent-better-performance-than-lunar-lake  This is not brand new architecture, it's refinement on battlemage to work more efficiently. Thinks of it as Xe2.5 but for some reason marketing is calling it Xe3.",Positive
Intel,">they dont think they have enough performance improvement in Xe3 to warrant a jump to a new branding name?      No what he said is that the Arc B Series hasn't been around for all that long and the B580 has garnered a very positive reception so they felt in terms of branding and marketing moving in Panther Lakes Xe³ into the B series brand is a better marketing move than throwing away the B series branding and starting the C series branding now. In others words they want Panther Lake to ride on the momentum and positive vibes the B series branding has garnered.   Xe³ is a Xe³ based architecture like Xe³P is architecturally but there is more to selling a product than the engineering, keep in mind there's strong rumors that there will be a B770 launch, Intel also just released the B60 and later this year will provide a big software expansion to Bxx cards so the B series brand is still full of life. Xe³P will launch much later and at that point Intel feels there will have passed enough time to leave the B series branding behind.",Neutral
Intel,An alternative explanation could also be that Celestial dGPUs *are* launching as Xe3P and they would want the launch of C series iGPU and dGPU to be around the same time and the same architecture.,Neutral
Intel,">so the A, B, C, (etc) Series is just branding?  Wasnt it always so? Xe is the architectural names, ABC was just branding for customers.",Neutral
Intel,"No public announcements yet, but logically it would make all the sense for Intel to launch them, and do so in larger quantities so people in the market can get them at MSRP. Battlemage proved there is a lot more demand than there was supply, and it'd take too long to ramp it up once it became clear they were received well. With proof of a market test pass, they've now got a chance to do it right.  They are excellent value products that would allow Intel to get a chunk of that market, given they are available in sufficient quantities at intended price points.",Positive
Intel,Is shader caching on first use a real problem? Sounds like bored people needing something to cry about again.,Negative
Intel,>RDNA 3.5 has a lot of ISA and part of hardware changes that went into RDNA 4  Do you have a source for this? I vaguely remember 3.5 wasn't really bringing particular changes,Neutral
Intel,That's exactly what everyone's new GPU generation is.  An entirely new architecture is extremely rare for any company.,Neutral
Intel,That's not what Peterson was talking about context wise when he addressed this in the video.,Neutral
Intel,"They would be extremely stupid not to continue to release discrete graphics cards, even if they decide to release 2-3 gaming SKUs per new generation; entry/budget, mid-range, high-end, etc.  - they win. until they keep iterating up, maturing driver, increasing install user base, improving software, until the point they can target higher segments (enthusiast tier)  Gaming GPUs remain the flagship component that pushes the limits of silicon design, features like ray tracing, AI upscaling, and real time path racing all debut in gaming before trickling into pro and AI workloads. Every research report shows that demand for high-end GPUs is still strong. Steam HW survey shows the most popular GPUs are still mid-range gaming cards, showing that discrete GPUs remain central to the PC ecosystem.  And yes, gaming GPUs are now marketed as AI accelerators too, Nvidia and AMDs GPUs both highlight AI compute as much as gaming.  Furthermore, if you look at the Steam HW survey, nobody gives a CRAP about 4k/8k gaming, meanwhile 1440p is growing! Nvidia, the leader in GPUs has been marketing for 4k gaming since 2013 with the 780 Ti/GTX 980 era, then 2016 with 1080/1080 Ti, 2018 with 2080/2080 Ti, 2020 with 3080/3090, and marketing for 8k gaming since 2020 with 3090, 2022 with 4090, and this year with 5090. So from 2013 to 2025 Nvidia has been marketing their GPUs as ""4k ready"" and ""8k ready"" but reality is that majority of gamers don't blame games at those resolutions. 4k adoption is only ~2-3% of users, and 8k is virtually nonexistent. So all Intel has to do is really focus on 1080p Ultra and 1440p High/Ultra gaming, above entry‑level (B570, A580) and below enthusiast (future B770/B780?) and keep optimizing and improving ray tracing and XeSS.",Neutral
Intel,[AMD RDNA 3.5’s LLVM Changes - by Chester Lam](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/amd-rdna-3-5s-llvm-changes),Neutral
Intel,"There are more to that, if you look at RDNA 4 and blackwell for example they had changes to the SMs, enc/dec, etc.   Here it using basically the same cores, but changes are made to better utilize those cores. I think this sentence summarize it the best:  ""Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products"".  Now I'm not saying it's a bad thing, Intel has a lot of inefficiencies with Battlemage, a lot of time you expect it perform better judging by the amount of hardware. By going this route the basically giving pretty good improvement only year after initial release with basically almost the same drivers. It's just not a new generation but something in the middle between a refresh and a new generation.",Neutral
Intel,"Not rare, but more like it only happens when there's a paradigm shift in graphics that necessitates it.   GCN -> RDNA or Pascal -> Ampere are the most recent ones.",Neutral
Intel,"its not extremely rare. It happens once every 7-10 years or so when they redesign it for significant changes. but yeah, most generations will be refinement.",Neutral
Intel,"In the end it is all matter of marketing, filter it for a moment and understand what it's. As he said ""leverage all the good work from battlemage"". As I read it and looking the architecture it's battlemage with some enhancement that will come to future product celestial. Something like RDNA 3.5. I think they messed up the naming - they want to present it as something new and different (it's in some aspects) but it's not the real next gen in their roadmap.",Neutral
Intel,By discrete iam assuming you mean client graphics SoCs? The margins are not enough on those - you make much more money on Pro cards/ HPC.,Neutral
Intel,"No this is not the case. The decision is purely branding. Xe3 and Xe3P are part of the same generation architecture wise unlike Xe2 and Battlemage, he addressed this.",Neutral
Intel,It's this. IGPU's will be for gamers and DGPU for data center. They basically both have said this :) People just don't notice anything. What do folks think RTX IGPU's on intel chips are gonna be for. LIKE LOL!,Neutral
Intel,"Then why he said ""when we move to our next architecture...""? Meaning they are not the same (Xe3 and Xe3P), also look at the slide they're grouping Xe2 with Xe3 under battlemage.  What you say contradicts their statements, and the article. The decision is of course marketing but nowhere they say Xe3 and Xe3P share the same architecture. This is why I said before it should've been called Xe2.5 or something of that sort like with RDNA 3.5.",Neutral
Intel,Next architecture is just rearrangement of existing cores into more effective set up. No contradictions.,Neutral
Intel,"When we will see deep dive into X3P celestial we will see what have changed. Until then it's just speculation of the differences between Xe3 and Xe3P. My bet there will be more changes than mere ""rearrangement of existing cores"".",Neutral
Intel,"Love a good TAP interview, hopefully he'll do some podcasts too once the embargo lifts.",Positive
Intel,"I like how TAP said ""expect even bigger investments in graphics in the future"". I hope this means what I think it means, because Intel \*must\* continue heavy investment in their own graphics. Accelerated compute is the future.",Positive
Intel,MLID must have an aneurysm seeing the guy still employed at Intel,Neutral
Intel,"Tom's an absolute gem. It's so frustrating to see the most passionate and effective communicators locked up behind embargoes and NDAs, so fingers crossed that this marks the next wave of tech exploration and deep dives. Always nice to see him pop up in a random GN or PC World video.  Credit where it's due, Lex (Alejandro) has also always been attentive and forthcoming in his Reddit interactions, even factoring in the usual embargo/NDA constraints. Hopefully he'll dust off his u/LexHoyos42 account; I'd love to see some mini-AMAs as Panther Lake trickles out.",Positive
Intel,Igpus not discrete gpus,Neutral
Intel,"I would not attempt to read much into claims like that. This is marketing, not an investment roadmap. I'm sure if you pressed them on it, the lawyers would have some words.   Remember, they've yet to even *talk* about dGPUs past BMG. And the big-iGPU NVL is reportedly cancelled (likely in favor of the Nvidia partnership).",Negative
Intel,Hahaha I can hear Tom saying “fucking Tom Peterson has been *lying* to you” as you say that,Negative
Intel,Problem is we don't know the real roadmap is for Intel. I really want them to put out a roadmap like they used to. But things in flux probably :s.,Negative
Intel,I think only way for intel to enter consumer GPU space is to start via iGPU at this point.  They just need to make bigger faster iGPU to make Nvidia RTX xx50/RTX xx60 redundant.,Neutral
Intel,I don't think partnership Nvidia iGPUs will be ready until TTL/HML circa 2029/2030.,Neutral
Intel,"Agreed, but then similarly I would also not attempt to conjecture on their roadmap outside of an investment roadmap... lack of a public roadmap update on graphics in a while is certainly saying something by not saying anything, but it's also not saying cancellations, etc...",Negative
Intel,There are just too many Toms in tech media. Tom of Moore's Law is Dead needs to thin out the competition.,Negative
Intel,I don't think even Intel knows what the real roadmap is anymore. They're so far behind on the previous ones that it's not surprising that they're not releasing new ones.,Negative
Intel,We are not competing with higher end GPUs. It seems they want to capture the budget segment and then move up the ladder.  But I don't like that iGPUs has more priority than dGPUs. Hope celestial comes into life in future,Negative
Intel,"Probably, but no sense offering an in-house big iGPU for just one gen. It needs to be a long-term commitment.",Neutral
Intel,"I mean, the layoffs tell a story. The dGPU group, and client graphics SoC in general, was gutted even before Lip Bu came on. To say it's likely a skeleton crew is probably doing it a favor.",Negative

Intel,"You think Intel is going to maintain these footholds any longer than they would need to?  This push of their dedicated GPUs into the professional space, is just a mere attempt to get rid of the unsold inventory of ARC-GPUs at the highest possible price-tag right from the beginning – Dumping those into the enterprise- and datacenter-space, in noble hope that someone clueless might bite upon the Intel-brand, and then dip into it at high costs *at non-existing support software-support* Intel pretends to deliver some time in the future.

Intel,"Even the fancy NVIDIA interconnects are a bottleneck for training performance, as are the memory bandwidth and even L2 bandwidth. One architects the algorithm around that. A tighter bottleneck is obviously not ideal, but it might still make sense depending on the price of the hardware.  As long as a copy of the full model and optimization state fits on the 24GB bank the PCI-E interconnect isn't really too limiting for training. Small models, like a 1B parameters voice model, will naturally fit. The larger the model you want to train, the more complex the architecture might be, but there are ways to train even models over 100B parameters on such hardware, like routing distributed fine grained experts.

Intel,"The implication here is incredibly obvious:  ""Intel Arc B-Series consistes of Battlemage discrete graphics *and* PTL iGPUs"".  That's the implication here. It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL",Neutral
Intel,Because it's most likely still the same foundation. Xe3 just have additional optimizations and HW blocks along the lines of OMM (confirmed) and whatever new tech Intel decides is worth pushing for higher end parts.

Intel,"> It explicitly calls BMG dGPU cards ""discrete"" and does not do so for PTL  Of course not, since it would instantly tank their reputation and will kill all further ARC-sales?!  Do you actually think, that Intel is that stupid to plain announce the death of ARC-series graphics-cards? Do you think they'd even sell a hundreds cards after such a announcement? Who would by a dead-end line of graphics-cards, which won't even get any further driver-support and still have disastrous drivers like Intel's ARC? NO-ONE!  Of course they virtue signal it through the backdoor here, to preserve the sell-off the of the rest of pile of shame of their B-series graphics-cards as long as possible (leaving users with none support afterwards), and *only then* pull the plug afterwards when they went through their inventory …  Since when are you following Intel? Intel has always done so, and only announced a sudden discontinuation once the inventory was sold (leaving customers in the open with no further support overnight), despite virtue signalling a continuation all the time (to preserve a proper sell-off).  ---- Wasn't this exactly the same story with **Optane** back then? Each and every question upon a future support was answered in the affirmative, only to pull the plug overnight again as usual …  I'm not another piracy of cons here, it's Intel pulling the same Optane-stunt with ARC – Happily selling off their cards, knowing darn well, that they will pull the plug, yet refuse to actually play with open cards again.",Negative

Intel,I would imagine intel has to at least get celestial out the door before cutting off their GPU line. it's been so long in development that it would be more of a waste of money to cancel it then finish it and see how it sells. at least getting it to the public means some kind of ROI and a solid position in the lower end of the GPU market that AMD and Nvidia are abandoning to the used market.,Negative

Intel,Lol if you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn,Neutral
Intel,"You have to look at this from both sides.  This would give NVidia the ability to offer OEMs a tightly integrated on SOC gfx solution vs a separate discrete gfx package as it is now. This would lower costs for NVidia's customers as well as improve performance and Intel's cpu's get to ride that train.   Intel has a long track record of using integrated gfx so it's certainly right up their alley to take this on.  Could Xe gfx coexist with NVidia? Yep, I think so.  Xe could be the budget igfx option and iNVidia is the premium integrated solution. That's basically how it is now with Intel Arc/Battlemage & GTX.   On the DC side, Intel has absolutely no gfx solution at this time and won't have anything for at least two years.  Intel already sells NVidia when a gfx solutions are needed so tighter integrated products will benefit both sides in that DC space as well.",Positive
Intel,"What's weirdest to me about this deal is. They specifically mention NVIDIA chiplets being packaged with Intel CPUs.   Now, with Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake, the CPU and the GPU are different tiles packaged together. But for Lunar Lake, the GPU was included in the same tile as the CPU, called the compute tile, because that was more efficient.   Supposedly, Panther Lake is using a different tile setup, with the GPU being separate again, or with the memory controller being on the tile with the CPU, but.   Either way, it feels to me like relying on separate NVIDIA chiplets for the integrated graphics is a bit of a limitation to how the overall architecture of the SoC can be designed.   My understanding is that, if another company buys Intel, that messes up the cross licensing agreement, and Intel might lose x86-64. So, even if NVIDIA keeps buying Intel stock, the most they can get is 49%.   And NVIDIA is too big now for Intel to buy, so the other way around wouldn't work. And even if NVIDIA wants to keep Intel's fabs open, I doubt they want to run them either.",Neutral

If you are referring to AIB Partners, then that can hardly be called an actual partnership. That's more of a contracted labor and distribution agreement.

Intel,"That really is up for debate. That they are losing money on them when you account for RNE and RnD amortized by unit, sure. That I have no doubt about.

That's way cheaper than RX 6600, it's a no brainer. But the prices could only go down thanks to economy of scale mostly. It's been produced for a while, that's why.  Also one of the big reasons it's still selling now is thanks to good publicity. Imagine if it came out as the same time as RX 9060 XT. HWU would tear a new hole regardless of how much of an improvement it is over the Alchemist cards and the impressive productivity performance. Those guys literally don't care about anything other than pushing a dozen more frames in a dozen personally chosen games. Gamer Nexus and Igor too to some extent. It would be bad publicity.",Positive

Intel,"So I spec our PCs at work. We do anything from traditional office work, to intense engineering tasks. On our engineering computers we run MatLAB, Ansys, Solidworks, MathCAD, LTSpice, Xilinx, Altium and other such apps. Lots of programming, VMs, design work, simulation testing, number crunching, and on occasion AI work.   This means we spec systems like with RTX Pro 500, RTX Pro 2000, RTX A4000, A4500, A6000s. The reason we have these rather than cheaper GeForce cards is mostly 3 things. Power/form factor, Driver certification, pro GPU features.   So typically Nvidia keeps the top binned chips for their professional cards meaning the power efficiency to performance is top tier. So we can get high performance single slot or low profile cards, or get some serious GPU performance in relatively small laptops. Drivers usually are validated better than the GeForce drivers, so they include better bug testing, and the apps we use validate performance with the cards which helps us evaluate performance. They also have way more vram like the RTX A4000 has 20GB of vram while being just a supped up 4070. Then from a feature perspective they have better VM passthrough support, or you can enable the vram to run in ECC mode for error correction. Very important when running 24-48 hour simulations.",Neutral

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong here, I'm more familiar with the Linux side / vGPU than VDI.  ECC is Error Correcting RAM. I generally don't understand the use case for ECC either, but it is ubiquitous in HPC. All server boards support ECC RAM.  In modern environments most of these features need 16GB of VRAM minimum, but if you ever wanted to try it on a consumer card, you could get an old RTX 20 series and try it out with some driver mods.

Calculations, it absolutely depends on what you're calculating and which bit gets flipped; flipping the low-order bit in a number might not matter much and flipping the high-order bit could cause a big error.  Networking, it depends on whether the protocols you use have more error checks at a higher level (TCP does; UDP does not).

Plus for each extra passthrough instance I would have to add in another GPU and this greatly increases power consumption, heat output and cooling requirements. The process is not all that much more complicated at least on Turing GPUs with a hacked driver on KVM guests at least. Plus for passthrough, you probably still need an NVIDIA card because last I checked AMD cards still had a random kernel panic issue after being passed through.  My assumption is that sr-iov on the b50 will allow users an affordable way to have multiple guests on one host GPU without increasing power draw and paying for expensive alternatives and expensive vGPU subscriptions.",Negative
Intel,"...first time I heard people prefer SRIOV over GPU passthrough because it's ""clumsier"" lol. I'm sure setting up mdev devices in KVM, finding the correct corresponding GPU instances, making them persistent through reboot, then edit virsh xml for each individual VM is a lot easier than just doing IOMMU passthrough. /s     Again, enthusiasts don't care about power consumption / heat output / cooling requirements for their lab environment. Enterprise that do care about them are very willing to pay extra cost to get a production ready driver. You're creating a hypothetical situation that simply does not exist in the real world.",Neutral

Intel,"The E core having more improvements than just 50% larger L2 is a nice surprise, but damn the efficiency and performance of it is insane. 29% and 22% more performance, at the same power draw is insane, clocking like 6.7% higher too. They used to be behind the others in performance with the E cores but had better efficiency but now they both have better performance and efficiency.  As for GPU, I always wanted them to focus on GPU performance next and they finally are doing it. Very nice, the expected 2x FP16 performance, which now matches the M4 which is insane(M5 will be even more insane). Gpu being 50-60% faster is a nice sight to see. For RT performance(I still find it not suited for mobile but M5 will be a separate matter) I’m surprised that the massive increase is just from 2nd gen dynamic caching, the architecture of the RT core is the same, just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  For the phone, vapor chamber is nice, them being conservative on having a low temperature limit can both be a good and bad thing which is shown, the good thing is that it means the surface temperature is lower so the user won’t get burned holding the device, and the bad thing is that it can leave performance off the table which is shown. As that can probably handle like another extra watt of heat and performance. Battery life is very nice, the fact that it can match other phones with like over 1000mAh bigger battery is funny. As people always flexing over how they have like a 4000, 5000mAh+ battery, of course having a bigger capacity is better, but the fact that Apple is more efficient with it and can have the same battery life at a much smaller battery speaks volumes about it.",Positive
Intel,"The occupancy characteristics of A19 Pro are quite incredible. 67% occupancy for a RT workload.  Look at Chips and cheese's SER testing. 36-44% ray occupancy with SER in Cyberpunk 2077 RT Overdrive.     Assuming NVIDIA can get this working on 60 series an effective a 52-86% uplift. After OMM and SER this seems like the third ""low hanging"" RT fruit optimization. Anyone serious about a PT GPU architecture NEEDs dynamic caching like Apple. And no this is not RDNA 4's Dynamic VGPR, it's a much bigger deal. Register file directly in L1$ has unique benefits.",Neutral
Intel,"Nice been waiting for this. P-core frontend improvements and branch, and a wider E-core with it's newer memory subsystem shows great YoY gains as usual. Though I am not surprised since it's been years leading up to this that Apple has steadily have been increasing power/freq to get the rest of it's performance gains, although IPC YoY is still class leading. The wider e-core takes the stage which is now commonly being focused in the industry (ex. Intel: Skymont etc). Excited for any outlet doing die analysis (I don't know if kurnal has done it yet).  Real generational GPU gains, instead of last year's YoY tick. Supposedly GPU size has not increased and that is impressive. Massive FP16 compute matching the M4, really shows their commitment to ML (as if naming 'tensor cores' wasn't obvious) and this will greatly help with prompt processing if you're into local models. Finally with a vapour chamber in the PRO models, performance overall really stretches it's legs and sustained is really respectable.  Also, since I'm skimming, I'm assuming A19 base like it's predecessor is a different SoC to the Pro. It is also really really refreshing to see the base A19 be better than the 18 Pro, little to no stagnation and a year at that. The base iPhone 17 looks like a reaaly reallly good option, more than ever, wished they didn't drop the Plus model. But man, I feel like waiting another year, hearing rumours about N2 and new packaging tech excites me.  That said, looking forward to QC, MT, and Samsung.

Intel,">I would be so curious about a die shot and GPU architecture of the A19 vs 8 Elite. Because Apple went from very little rt not so long ago to leading the charts. Like how many RT-Acceleration units are used in the GPU and how other components play into that.  Me too. I'd imagine a marginal increase in size over A18 Pro. The P cores have mostly stayed the same. And the E cores despite major changes are unlikely to contribute to a major increase in area (if I'm right, individually they occupy around 0.6-0.7mm2 per core). The extra cache (around 2MB) should increase area slightly. SLC area as well should contribute to that increase.  I'd imagine the GPU with the new RT units, doubled FP16 units, new tensor cores, and general uarch improvements are the major contributor to any notable area increase.  Plus I still don't feel like the approaches these companies are taking are aligned very much in terms of GPU architectures. For eg, Apple's been very focussed on improving compute performance on their GPU. Qualcomm less so.  >Definetly exciting times, I think that the major players, Qualcomm, Apple, and Mediatek, are not so far away from each other,   True that. Qualcomm has a shot at taking the ST crown lead from Apple atleast in SPECfp. But Apple's done extremely well with this upgrade. The E core jump has made them close the nT gap with Qualcomm while using much lower power.  GPU is a case where technically Qualcomm could take raw perf crown. But Apple's RT dominance, Tensor cores and general compute lead might help them in the desktop space.  >Especially interesting will be how AMD client will turn out in 2026, if they are still on the charts (we expect Zen 6 clients on N3) or if Qualcomm will top windows charts, and Apple overall all the charts.  Its either Qualcomm or Apple. AMD is too far behind Oryon and Apple's uarchs. They consume similar or even more area for their core architecture while lagging in performance while using significantly more power. The x86 ecosystem and compatibility is the only reason they'd survive Oryon.",Neutral
Intel,Having so many SoC makers on arm competing against each other by one upping each other yearly is bearing fruit vs x86. i don't know how Intel and AMD long term can fare at this rate. Arm CPUs are still showing double digit gains yearly.,Neutral
Intel,Most of apples RT gains are from optmsiing how the GPU deals with divergence.  This is not dedicated RT silicon so much as making the GPU be able to maintain much higher throughput when there is lots of divergence.  RT operations have a shit tone of divergence.,Negative
Intel,I can't wait to see die shots and measurements for these chips. The A18 Pro and A18 die shots were really interesting to see what was compacted or lost for the base model chip. I have a feeling that there will be bigger differences for the A19 Pro and A19 with that giant SLC on the former. Die areas will also be interesting. Cache isn't cheap for area and I'd also love to see inside the new E-cores and GPU.,Positive
Intel,">Growing the E core into a medium core is really important and something I was worried apple might miss out on, but this means they should be able to keep up in multicore as trends point to flooding CPUs with E cores.  I wouldn't say its a medium core yet tbh. Apple's E cores are still sub 1mm2 in area usage. Compared to other ""M cores"" they are still relatively small. I imagine the A19 Pro E core is fairly larger but the A18 E core was around 0.6/0.7mm2 in size. I'd imagine its not grown a whole lot.  >They really ~~buried~~ deleted the lede by not even mentioning the E core improvements beyond the cache and undersold the GPU. I suppose this means we should expect a lot of bragging in the M5 keynote.  I'd imagine they're saving up these to mention Blender perf etc in M5 keynote.",Neutral

Intel,> just basically a more efficient scheduler which improves utilization and less waste.  When you take a look at GPUs doing RT task you see that they tend to be very poorly utilized.  GPUs are not designed for short running diverging workloads. But RT is exactly that. So you end up with a huge amount of divergence and or lots of wave like submissions of very small batches of work (so have a large scheduling overhead).     There is a HUGE amount of perfomance left on the table for this type of task for HW vendors that are able to reduce the impact on GPU utilization that divergence has.,Negative
Intel,Maybe Apple measures occupancy differently in their tools. I wouldn't be too sure comparing these two. But I'd definitely think a combination of SER and Dynamic Caching present in A19 should result in very good utilization compared to other uarchs.,Positive

Intel,"No. I'm positive memory bandwidth offers very little in terms of performance upgrades. If you recall, the A16 was essentially the same GPU architecture as the A15 but used LPDDR5 instead of LPDDR4X, yet there were practically zero performance improvements.  I don't think anyone has investigated the A19's GPU microarchitecture thoroughly. But the main improvements seem to come from the increase in SLC size (System Level Cache which serves the GPU) from 24Mb to 32Mb and the newly improved Dynamic Caching.

Peak power P/W is not a very accurate measure to compare gen on gen. And I really doubt you'll be seeing 10W of ST power consumption on a phone. Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.   An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced.

Intel,">All of these benchmarks are sort of difficult to compare when the other chips aren't made on the same node N3P.   N3P is a mere 5% faster than N3E when comparing similar microarchitectures... This is straight from TSMC's marketing slides.  Comparitively, barring the P core (which did see an ok improvement), the E core and the GPU have seen 30%+ improvements. The node has nothing to do with it.  If Qualcomm loses to, matches or exceeds A19 Pro this year it would be because of their updated microarchitectures and have barely anything to do with minor single digit improvements offer by a sub node.",Neutral

It's interesting how first gen dynamic caching + SER (apple equivalent) is hardly better than NVIDIA in terms of occupancy. Yet only 44%. So only slightly better than NVIDIA (upper end of range). Seems like first gen was more about laying the groundwork while second gen is really about pushing dynamic caching allocation granularity and efficiency. At least so it seems.  Oh for sure. That occupancy is incredibly high. \~1.5x uplift vs A18 Pro. Getting 70% occupancy in RT workload is really unheard of. Apple engineers did a fine job.  AMD might opt for this nextgen if they're serious, but it's a massive undertaking in terms of R&D, but could massively benefit PT and branch code, ideal for GPU work graphs.",Neutral

On one hand, the power inflation isn't causing problems if the 23% increased battery life per Wh is anything to go by, but on the other, what's the point of chasing peak performance like this if your boost/scheduling algorithms never allow that speed to make an impact on responsiveness?",Negative
Intel,"Geekerwan's results are ***average*** power, not peak power, IIRC. These are real, actual frequency bins that Apple has allowed.  These frequency bins *will* be hit by some workloads, but just not nearly as long as SPEC & active cooling will allow. It would be good to revisit Apple's boosting algorithms, but IIRC, they hit 100% of Apple's design frequency in normal usage.  It's not like users have a choice here; we can't say, ""Please throttle my A19 Pro to the same power draw as the A18 Pro."" Low power mode neuters much of the phone, so it's rarely used all the time.  //  I find avgerage power useful two reasons:  1. *How* performance vs power were balanced; here, performance took precedence while not keeping power stable.  2.

TSMC claims [up to 5% to 10% less power](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track) on N3P vs N3E.  I agree 10W is not common and SPEC is a severe test, but it's more the *pattern* that has emerged on Apple's fp power and whether it's worth it:  2023 - A17 Pro P-Core: 6.40W  2025 - A19 Pro P-Core: 10.07W  Apple has leaped +**57%** average fp power in two years. Seems like not a good compromise when you're eating more power per unit of performance.

Geekerwan tests these things using Liquid Nitrogen. They are to test an SoC without restraints.  I agree it's rare, but why would Apple allow 10W? Were many workloads ***lacking*** fp performance that users prefer a bit less battery life for +9% fp perf vs the A18 Pro?  Of course, to most, battery life is more important, IMO, which is why core energy is most crucial, but missing here.  //  >An A19 Pro P core does seem to have increased performance at the same power by about 5%. Only P/W at peak has reduced. Which isn't even an issue when these phones would never reach that peak in daily use.  So the question becomes: do users want slightly better perf and 5% more power?

Intel,"the shader re-ordering is different. (apple also do this).  Even with shader re-ordering you have the issue that you're still issuing 1000s of very small jobs.    GPUs cant do lots of small jobs, they are designed to do the same task to 1000s of pixels all at once.     If  you instead give them 1000 tasks were each pixel does something differnt the GPU cant run that all at the same time... in addition the overhead for setup and teardown of each of these adds even more void space between them.   So apple are doing a hybrid approach, for large groups of function calls they do re-ordering (like NV) but for the functions were there is not enough work to justify a seperate dispatch they do function calling.    This is were dynamic coaching jumpstart in.      Typical when you compile your shader for the GPU the driver figures out the widest point within that shader (the point in time were it need the most FP64 units at once, and register count).  Using this it figures out how to spread the shader out over the GPU.  Eg a given shader might need at its peak 30 floating pointer registers.   But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time.   If you have a shader with lots of branching logic (like function calls to other embedded shaders) the driver typically needs to figure out the absolute max for registers and fp units etc.  (the worst permutation of function branches that could have been taken).  Often this results in a very large occupancy footprint that means only a very small number of instances of this shader can run at once on your GPU.  But in realty since most of these branches are optional when running it will never use all these resources.  The dynamic cache system apple has been building is all about enabling these reassures to be provided to shaders at runtime in a smarter way so that you can run these supper large shader blocks with high occupancy as the registers and local memory needed can be dynamically allocated to each thread depending on the branch it takes",Neutral
Intel,"While RT does have lots of branching logic (and CPUs are much better at dealign with this) you also want to shader the result when a ray intercepts, and this is stuff GPUs are rather good at (if enough rays hit that martial)   We have had CPU RT for a long time and so long as you constrain the martial space a little GPUs these days, even with all the efficiency  loss are still better at it.   (there are still high end films that opt for final render on cpu as it gives them more flexibility in the shaders they use) but for a game were it is all about fudging it GPUs are orders of magnitude faster, you just have so much more fp compute throughput on the GPU even if it is running at 20% utilization that is still way faster than any cpu.",Positive
Intel,"Its not just useful for RT but also for a lot of other situations, being able to just call out to functions on the GPU and not pay a HUGE divergence penalty (you still pay some) opens up GPU compute to a load more cases were we currently might not bother.",Neutral
Intel,I'm a bit confused. You think lagging 15% behind in P/W the competition for an entire year is not being a generation behind?  ARM themselves have managed only a 15% jump this year.

If the faster LPDDR5X-9600 in the A19 Pro eats more power, it's fair to include that power because ***all*** A19 Pros will ship with LPDDR5X-9600. That was Apple's choice to upgrade to this faster memory.    Now, you're very right: we can't purely blame the uArch at Apple. It may well be the DRAM or the boost algorithms (like we saw at the A18 Pro launch last year) and—at Apple specifically—even the marketing overlords.  It's also why I'm a big proponent of JEDEC speeds & timings & volts in desktop CPU tests, much to the chagrin of a few commenters.",Neutral

Intel,"While the efficiency for this is BAD, I dont think its 20W per core.  When we look at results by [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-zen4c-scaling/2) we can see \~7-8W per core for this (not great numbers, because its a weird chip and different node), which is still very bad. AMD certainly has some power issues, but many of which, i.e. inefficient I/O dies, are not really dependent on the CPU uArch and could switch at any moment. They certainly have much more inefficient chips at the moment than both Apple and Qualcomm. For Zen 6 we expect a major update to the desktop chiplet architectur which could bring some much needed improvements in terms of I/O though.  They have reasonably fast cores, and I think they are not in a terrible position, even though it is far from good. I think what is interesting for AMD to look out for is that they keep moving fast, instead of intel who didnt move fast since like 14nm, and AMD has strong cores. Additionally AMD has (including from the datacenter) an enterprise need to make the CPUs more efficient.  So yeah, very bad CPUs efficiency wise. A bit behind, but not terribly on perf per node wise, efficiency on the desktop is an afterthought for AMD, clearly, but they are moving constantly and are improving. It might be AMD Laptop Zen 6 has again like 35W TDP, for 3000 Geekbench and be dead, but with some client oriented tweaks I see chances (maybe just from the patterns in the tea leaves in my mug)",Negative

But each GPU core (SM) might only have 100 registers so the driver can only run 3 copies of that shader per core/SM at any one time."" on that, there would be 10 registers wasted doing nothing, if it cant find any else thats <10 registers to fit in that.",Neutral

Intel,"Because we don’t have the tools. On macOS Apple provides powermetrics but Apple states that the figures can’t necessarily be relied on.

Intel,"dynamic caching would let more copies of the shader run given that is knows the chances that every copy hits that point were it needs 30 registers is very low.   If that happens then one of those threads is then stalled but the other thing it can do is dynamicly at runtime convert cache, and thread local memroy to registers and vice versa.   So what will happen first is some data will be evicted from cache and those bits will be used as registers.   maybe that shader has a typical width of just 5 registers and only in some strange edge case goes all the way up to 30.

Intel,"Yeah, I guess that wasn't clear. What I meant is that the IPC of the E-core is so much higher than Tiger Lake that it's performance at 2.6GHz is surprisingly close to desktop Tiger Lake at 5GHz.  I know it's not fair to compare with Intel 10nm (later Intel 7) with TSMC N3P as it's 2 major nodes apart, but this goes way beyond that because these chips are using only around 2.5w for just the E-cores. TSMC claimed 25-30% power savings from N7 to N5 and another 30-35% from N5 to N3.  Using these numbers, we get these 4 E-cores using somewhere around 6-7w PEAK, but this is all-core turbo. Intel's CPU at it's most efficient 12w configuration won't hit it's 4.4GHz turbo required to win in single-core performance and is going to hit closer to its 1.2GHz base clock in all-core sustained performance at which point the E-cores not only have their giant IPC advantage, but double the clockspeed too.

You will also use this mixed martial uber shader to use up all the dregs that do not fit within a SMD group.      Eg you might have 104 rays hit a martial but that martial shader can only fit 96 threads into a SIMD group so has 8 remaining thread, you don't want to just dispatch these on there own as that will have very poor occupancy (with 88 threads worth of compute ideal) so you instead inline them within a uber shader along with a load of other overflow.",Neutral

High enough that if they wanted to have supply for a 5050, they might not have enough GB206 dies that can be cut down to 20/36 SMs.  The 5060M is probably catching the bulk of the bottom-level GB206 dies at 26/36.  There's also the memory difference, with the 5050 having gddr6 while the rest of the lineup uses gddr7. With dies this small, that cost difference in memory could actually make it worth taping out a new chip with controllers for the cheaper stuff. Gddr6 is dirt cheap at this point.  You could absolutely then argue that there's no reason for the 5050 to be so cut down that it needs a new, even smaller die, and that Nvidia can eat some margins on a budget card to give it better memory. And I'd agree. But I'm sadly not anybody who can make that decision.  Personally, I can't wait to see what becomes of the cut-down GB207s. The 5050 is a ""golden"" fully-enabled die.

Intel,Same can be said for the 5050 no? Both have CPU overheads unlike AMD which any mid-range AMD GPU can easily outperform Nvidia's 5090 at 1080p.   The 12GB VRAM however are better suited for people who are stuck at older Gen3/Gen4 PCIE speeds.,Neutral
Intel,"It'll run nearly every game in existence at 1080p with playable framerates with the right settings. IDK why it would be a product for non-gamers.

It's so bad that even the prebuilts with the 16GB 9060XT will be outsold by prebuilts with a 5050 at the same price range, as companies like to pair trash GPUs with ""high"" end CPUs like a 13700F to clear stock but the ""i7"" allows them to mark up the price.",Negative

This card is 80% the performance of a 5060, which should probably be called the 5050.  To take it a step further, the GT 1030 was 13% of the 1080ti, the 5050 is 20% of the 5090.

Intel,"It's not about the performance vs XX60. It's about the CUDA core count and bandwith vs biggest die in the lineup. You can find those numbers on Gamer's nexus latest shrinkflation video on this topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caU0RG0mNHg). Considering those things, the 5060 is essentially a 5050 and the 5050 is a 5030.  The GT 730 had 13.3% as many cores as the full GK110 die, with a 50W TDP.  The GT 1030 had around 10.3% as many cores as the full GP102 die, with a 30W TDP though this one was impressive.  The GXT 1630 had around 11% as many cores as full TU102 die, with exactly 75W TDP.  The RTX 5050 has 10.7% as many cores as the full GB202 die (RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell), and around 11.7% vs the 5090 (which is the number you'll se on Gamer's Nexus video, he rounds it up to 12%, I think that was a mistake on his part? I'm not gonna try and correct him though), but it has a TDP of 130W somehow, just 15W less than the 5060, that's absurd.  Hence why I'm saying it SHOULD be a sub 75W TDP card, and priced way below that. My theory is that it was OC'ed past its efficiency curve to make it at least moderately better than the 3060 and still be able to call it a XX50 card.",Neutral

Also comparing the performance diff between the 1030 vs 1060 because guess what the 5060 should have been the 5050 looking at die size and memory bus.   Not sure why people keep defending these naming schemes, do you think the engineers use them internally lol? Its bullshit that marketing comes up with",Negative
Intel,"Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍 Doesn't matter if die sizes get bigger, that's up to Nvidia. Just because the halo product got bigger doesn't mean they can get away with moving their product stack (below the XX90) one tier up in prices.   I guess it is a dog shit methodology to use, only Gamer's Nexus uses it and I'm sure #1 Nvidia apologist u/Alive_Worth_2032 knows more than him.   It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree.  And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  If you can't see that Nvidia is putting all the effort into binning high end chips for AI cause it's 90% of their income, then I don't know what to tell you. Obviously it's a good move for them, and it works, but there's 0 reason for a gaming customer to defend them for it. We used to get much more out of their chips in the gaming cards for more reasonable prices, why's it wrong to want that?   You can't just draw a conclusion based on relative performance between 2 underpowered products, you compare them to the ""best"" Nvidia COULD give us (which is the full top die for each generation) and go down from there.  Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm^2. That's not even an excuse.",Neutral
Intel,"> It's a shit methodology to use if you love conformism and shrinkflation in GPUs, I agree. And it's a shit methodology to use if you're an Nvidia executive.  You can chose one methodology.   You can decide on comparing what hardware you get at a certain price point.   Or you can ignore price/bom and look only at arbitrary model numbers as if they mean something.  You cannot do both at the same time.  Personally I prefer to look at die area. The 5050 today is roughly comparable to the 1050 Ti, comparing it to the top cards that are not comparable is irrelevant.  Pascal did not have a analogue for the 5090, period.  >Exactly they're not the same tier, that's why I compared the 1030 to the Titan Pascal and the 5050 to the RTX 6000 Blackwell. 👍  That changes nothing. The Pascal Titan are using the same die as the 1080 Ti. The whole tier of die that is used in today's consumer top SKUs and for the RTX 6000 Blackwell, DID NOT EXIST back then.  >Edit: just look at the 3090/ti and how the chips were proportionally fine still compared to it and that die was 628mm2. That's not even an excuse.  What are you even trying to say? Ampere also did not have a analogue to the 5090. The 3090 Ti, even it is sitting almost a tier below the 5090. The 2080 Ti and 5090 are unmatched in other generations.",Negative
Intel,"You’re still missing the point by focusing purely on die area and pretending model numbers are arbitrary. Model numbers mean something, nvidia knows that so that’s why they kept them consistent for so long (unlike AMD that's hella inconsistent). Because they rely on the perception of tier consistency from generation to generation, even if they’ve worsened the specs behind the scenes.  You say you “prefer to look at die area,” but that’s irrelevant unless you’re building the chips yourself. Customers don’t game on silicon real estate they game on actual performance and hardware capabilities. And the cuda core count + bandwidth vs top-die approach directly shows how much nvidia is offering relative to what they could offer if they weren't prioritizing AI margins.  So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  > Pascal did not have a 5090 analogue  That’s just semantics. Every generation has had a full-fat top die, whether branded as “Titan,” “RTX 6000,” or whatever, which where I drew the comparison. Comparing lower-tier cards to the top die is how you reveal how much of the architecture's potential is being offered to gamers.  And yes, 3090 and 3090 Ti still preserved proportionally higher specs vs top-tier dies. What changed now is not just die sizes, it’s NVIDIA reserving most of the silicon for AI and throwing scraps to gaming.  > You can choose one methodology...  Sure, and I chose one: compare the lowest-tier GPU to the top die, which accurately shows how nvidia has been shrinkflating consumer value over time. You're welcome to look at BOM and TDP too the 5050 still loses. It should be sub 75W and priced accordingly.  I think it's okay to call it an XX40 series card even if we keep the TDP at 75W but the XX30 series would need to disappear. What I don't agree with is using the die area excuse to justify shrinkflation just because the 5090 is such a halo product.",Neutral
Intel,"> So yes I stand by my comparison of the core count vs flagship, I think it's fair to judge Nvidia based on that.  Do you even listen to your own madness?  You realize that what you are saying. Is that the lower end 5000 series would be ""better"". If Nvidia removed the 5090 entirely. And renamed the 5080 the 5080 Ti, and made the 5070 Ti into the new 5080.  Suddenly, you would praise the lower end cards for being ""better"". Purely because the high end is less powerful. Nothing else changed, no one is getting more hardware for their money.  Jesus Christ the mental gymnastics you people go trough.   The hardware Nvidia gives you for your money, is all that matters.

I have also seen reviews of this graph where it raises more FPS in 1440p than in 1080p, as if the resolution made it a bottleneck.  I understand that in 1080p the load goes more towards the CPU and in 1440p the load falls on the GPU, however the difference in performance catches my attention. I have an R5 5600x and in theory it should not generate a bottleneck but this graph seems to be quite ""CPU dependent"" in 1080p resolution.",Neutral
Intel,"Your CPU will mostly hold you back if you are playing an extremely CPU-intensive game (rare) or you are already pushing very high frames. In general, GPU is most important for gaming, although this varies based on resolution. At 1080p, the CPU is a lot more important than it is at 4k, where the GPU will virtually always be the limiter (unless you're running an ancient CPU with a 5090 or some absurd scenario). Still, even at 1080p the GPU is going to be a limiter much more often than the CPU.     Arc B580 no? Because that's what you said in your title. Arc will be okay as I mentioned, but it won't be as good as a 9060xt. 9060xt is ~20-50% better on average, which is quite significant. That being said, if you absolutely cannot afford the 16GB version of the 9060xt then I would just go with the arc because running into VRAM limits will be disabling.",Neutral

The 5080 isn’t worth the cost increase (at the time of price vs performance), so the next logical choice was a 4090 or 5090 (or a proper workstation AI card in my case, which I ruled out for personal purposes).",Positive
Intel,"5070ti if you care about Nvidia features/software set, 9070XT if not.",Neutral
Intel,"5070 Ti is the best for your price range. 5080 has what, 10-15% more performance with the same VRAM? Absolutely not worth it for how much more you're paying to get it.  9070 XT is also another option if you're not yet spoiled of Nvidia's software toys like DLSS and MFG and only want the highest performance for the lowest cost.",Positive
Intel,I have the same question but for an RTX3090... Is there any point in looking for an upgrade right now?,Neutral
Intel,"Since power efficiency is a big concern for you, I might actually pitch to you the normal 9070, you can get them for around ~500 (got mine for 510 after tax), and it undervolts and over clocks amazingly and routinely has some of the best power efficiency across the board for GPU's, and depending on if you really want to squeeze performance out you could even BIOS upgrade it to the 9070 XT to see what performance gain it squeezes out.  Contradicting myself, but the 9070 XT has been selling at MSRP recently so that ~599 price tag for it does make it attractive, and you can just undervolt and set a negative power limit on it to make it insanely power efficient which would make it the better purchase potentially.  Money aside, the 5070 TI is probably the safest bet for you, but if you'd rather save some money and get bang for buck long term, then 9070 is a solid sleeper contender, especially if you are thinking of going Linux (which I highly recommend if you aren't locked into windows for a work program).",Positive
Intel,"Those power draws are abit insane. My old 3080ti tuf pulls roughly 350w to 370w but just slightly oc. I went with the 5080 gaming trio and so far its pulling 220-290w in all games, helldivers 2, wukong, expedition 33 and bf6. Its also oc, clocks up to 3.2ghz and 17ghz on memory. I play on 1440p.",Neutral
Intel,I’d go 5070ti in your shoes,Neutral
Intel,Reduce the list to 5070Ti or 9070XT and get whatever is cheapest. Both will be more than fine for your use-case.,Positive
Intel,"If you want power efficiency, the base 5070 is the way to go. I'm saying that from experience as I also had an EVGA 3080 but the 12gb/hybrid card which is close to the ti.   I first bought a 5070 Foundets and it was very efficient but I wanted the additional VRAM and the jump was nice but when it's all said and done, the 5070 was on par with the 3080 and the ti version just a bit above that.    There's been truly, truly terrible performance jumps since the 3xxx cards. It all been less power and software bumps. The raw power of Nvidia cards has been marginal at best.   The 5080 would be the performance bump if you want that but again, the base 5070 is the way to go **BUT** hold off just yet. The Super cards are coming and you will be able to get the efficuency of the 5070 with the Vram of the 5070ti.   Hold, soldier.",Neutral
Intel,"If you have a  budget that includes actual hi-end then why would you settle for something that has less features(or worse implemented) and less driver support(they will try to push 6-7000 series support again, I guarantee that)? Go for  5070ti-5080 it will be worth it",Neutral
Intel,If you just need it for gaming go for 9070xt. Fsr4 looks promising and its bit cheaper than 5070ti. If you’re also doing ml development choose 5070ti amd software stack and support is terrible.,Negative
Intel,There are some 5080s sitting around $999 before tax so might as well get that imo,Neutral
Intel,5070ti cuz nvidia is bestest,Neutral
Intel,Ngl temps were never a problem on my 3080 but the power draw difference is really massive. I drop at least 100W or even 150W of power consumption in some games and that amounts to quite a bit of savings if you look at a 3 year period especially if you live in a country where electricity is expensive. Also the reduced heat is a bonus in the summer.,Positive
Intel,"Planning on getting 5070 Ti Super when it arrives next year hopefully, that to my knowledge is specs wise the exact same, except it has 24GB of VRAM and I recall a bit higher power demand, since I highly doubt they have fixed the cable combustion issue of 5080 and 90, so I'm not getting either of those or 80's super variant. How does it run on 2k?",Neutral
Intel,ZOTAC 5070ti is a very good card! Got the same and no complaints.,Positive
Intel,Same upgrade as I.   I don’t understand why the 5080 has the same VRAM as the 5070ti. I was looking at potentially going up to the 5080 but couldn’t justify the cost vs the frames I was going to get from it.,Negative
Intel,das rite brotha ai is love and nvidia is life,Positive
Intel,Considering that he really cares about power efficiency - 5070Ti it is. Routinely sips 100w less than 9070XT under comparable load.,Neutral
Intel,"Great points. Settled on 5070 Ti. I did want DLSS and specifically, seeing RTX and DLSS 4 with frame gen on cyberpunk made me pull the trigger.   Also, I’m happy to see that almost everyone has the same opinion on price to performance ratio being of poor value for 5080 when 5070Ti is almost identical for 30-50% less.",Positive

Intel,"I’m locked into windows but I do dual boot Ubuntu with it. I also do a lot of gaming on the side so anti cheat wouldn’t function properly on Linux. The media encoding software that I run also requires Windows, although it does run fine in a VM.   I did settle on 5070 TI but I have 60 days to swap it. I hadn’t considered Linux stability though. Is AMD a more attractive option for Linux?",Neutral
Intel,Because of efficiency. I really want to get some more info on AMD vs NVIDIA. 16GB ram regardless. I’ll take the lesser to save extra money.,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, perfectly fine. It feels like a great card for it.   I’m playing on 2560x1440 and it’s a great card. I’ve noticed when I play CP2077, FG set at x4 just creates way too much input lag. So the sweet spot is probably x 2 or x 3.   All the other games I play, I’ve cranked up the settings a couple notches and it’s honestly been solid.",Positive
Intel,Exactly. If it had 24gb vram that’d be worth it. Maybe the 5080 Ti will get it but I couldn’t wait. Solved my bigger AI workload needs in other ways and this card is good enough for my gaming needs.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia doesn't love you back.  They're a business just like AMD, they care about what's in your wallet.",Negative
Intel,"Stock definetly, but the 9070XT undervolts really good. Mine maxes out with a decent unvervolt at \~225W down from 305W max, without loosing any performance and much better noise profile.  No experience with undervolting recent Nvidia GPUs though, last I've had was a GTX 1080...",Positive
Intel,Thought so. Thanks!,Positive
Intel,Yeah 5090 seems to be the only card promising a notable uptake in performance rn.,Positive
Intel,"Totally valid choice, I would say the 5070 TI is probably the safest bet for your use case! play hundreds of PC games, however I don't play ones with anti cheat (don't care for LoL or valorant or COD/BF6, I mostly play single player games or games that don't have that), so it's a complete non-issue for me, but if you play mostly multiplayer then yeah that is a non starter for some of the popular games, even with proton and most games working on Linux out of the box now.   For me Windows has just become too bloated and digging its claws into every little thing that it's finally reaching ""straw that broke the back"" moment for me, and AMD is basically the bread and butter for Linux with the mesa drivers basically embedded in them out of the gate. Nvidia has made some progress recently on Linux drivers, but for most people it's safe to have an AMD card if you are going exclusively Linux for the foreseeable future.",Positive

Intel,"Any of the 80 class beyond 4000 series will outperform the 3090. Only question is if you want or need the extra frames, only you can answer. I went from a 3080ti to 5080 and its not only more powerful, it draws like 100w lesser.",Positive
Intel,"Thank you. I’ll keep it at the top then. Would you do 5080 over 5070Ti for the extra cost, or since same VRAM, about the same weight?",Neutral
Intel,"My rtx3090's power limit is 350 W. Somehow the 3080ti can draw much more  I'm not ready to cash out for the 5080 or 5090 yet, while 4080 only seems to give me a negligible boost... So I think I'll wait for the 6000 series",Negative
Intel,"Depends on how much more expensive 5080 is, at my country it is 900 vs 1300 euro, so they are not even close.",Neutral
Intel,Well in general the 4080 super is like 20-30% faster than the 3090 and the 5080 is about 10-11% faster than the 4080 super..? sure if you are already getting good playable framerates dont bother. Just hit snooze and wait. The jump from 50 from 40 series is indeed abit sad.,Negative
Intel,"I have 5070Ti MSI FOR $850 USD or 5080 FE for $999 so the margin is much closer. However, if I did a branded aftermarket card, it would be similar difference to your pricing and probably not worth it. Considering holding for Super but I’d like to game soon especially since I’ve no idea when they’ll announce super cards, yet alone release them.",Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 kinda fell out of most comparison charts for some reason (even though 3070 and 3080 still show up), but I've seen 3090 vs 4080 and the FPS average is like 10-12% which isn't worth the investment imo. As for the 5080/5090, the difference is expected to be higher so there's more sense in aiming for one... But I wish I had the budget lmao.

Intel,I just bought an AOC Q27G40XMN which is 1440p 180hz. Good to hear it should be ok on that.   I'm also going to try it out on my living room TV so that would be 4k w/ upscaling. My understanding is that would shift more of the work to the GPU from the CPU so even less chance of bottlenecking.,Positive

Intel,7800x3d. It's always the 7800x3d if gaming is the main concern. This is asked hourly now with these exact CPUs.,Neutral
Intel,There’s no nuance if they’re the same price   Gaming is the bottleneck so you saying “that’s it” makes no sense in this context   If you couldn’t cool it or you had an imaginary job where a 9700x made you more money due to speed but for some reason you didn’t buy a 9950x then it’s a factor   These scenarios where the 9700x is better isn’t something you run into,Negative
Intel,"Go with the 7800x3d and you won't need pricey RAM or a high-ish end mobo. With RAM prices what they are right now, the 7800x3d makes more sense. The 9700x can come very close to the x3d's performance with RAM tuning though, but at a markedly high power consumption as well as more heat.      This video highlight that. The overall cost difference between the two becomes much less when you factor in the better RAM needed to get that performance from the 9700x     [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkoiCfDK1SU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkoiCfDK1SU)",Neutral
Intel,"For your use case, since work is light, 7800X3D. It's a no brainer.",Positive

Intel,"X3d chips stacks cache memory on top of cpu cores (which is why it's called ""3d""). In a perspective of cooling, these cache memory is placed in between cpu cores and the cooler, and thus hinders the cooling.",Neutral
Intel,"I have had both. Benched and tuned both. For your application it'll be better getting the 9700x in terms of performance.  However it'll take you to tune it, and it'll cost in terms of energy and heat.  9700x uses more and produces more heat if given the room to stretch. 7800x3d gets shafted at the factory and isn't allowed to run as hot and much lower vcore.  What people don't seem to understand when they talk about cpu bottleneck is where in the cpu is it.  For games like wow and other mmorpg that doesn't max out CPU but max out 1/2T l3 cache speed, zen5 is a better performer than zen4 x3d. So you'll be spending less up front and getting better performer.  For games like pubg arc raiders etc, latency and bigger l3 cache is more effective.  Finally do you care about 1% lows.  If you do, you need to both tune your ram subtimings as well as 9700x for the best performance.  And even then you may not catch the 7800x3d given the same tuning.  However at higher res than 1080p, at 2k etc, AVG fps they're basically neck and neck or trade blows game dependent.  Once again any game that favors l3 freq, max core freq the 9700x will move ahead given tuned.  And the rest that isn't about top end max freq but cache size and latency, 7800x3d will move ahead. There's a reason why amd x3d is the best for gaming when intel had boosted higher and benched better synthetics",Neutral
Intel,"Gaming the x3d chips are always better. For 99,99% of gamers it doesn’t make sense to get a non x3d chip currently and you’re not part of that 0.01% if you’re not asking.",Neutral
Intel,"As long as you can afford it, go for the X3D. It runs a bit hotter, but a small undervolt can easily bring temperatures down. Gaming performance can be up to 30% higher, though on a 5060 Ti it might not make a huge difference. Still, it’s more future-proof if you plan to upgrade later.",Positive
Intel,this and “5070 or 5070ti”,Neutral
Intel,Mostly right. Except the fact that the 7800X3D consumes significantly more power and thus heat production.   The 9700X really.tops out at about 110W or so with normal tuning. The 7800X3D does upwards of 140w.  The TDP of the 9700X with PBO tuning is 105w. The nominal TDP of the 7800X3D is 120W.,Neutral
Intel,And I also read that gaming performance is related to the monitor’s refresh rate - in my case it’s 100 Hz. Does that affect anything?,Neutral
Intel,On Aliexpress yesterday there was a sale you could get 7800x3d for 220€ or 9800x3d for 340€. 9700x is around the same price as 7800x3d with the promo,Neutral

Intel,5070ti or 5080,Neutral
Intel,"The power differences you mention are an additional led bulb being on or off, irrelevant compared to the total system power.      Since the price difference in zero in the OPs market, I recommended the 7800x3d. Sure, he'll lose some multicore performance, but it's just easier to deal with an x3d chip. With an all core -30 mv undervolt, these chips run even cooler.",Neutral
Intel,"Sort of. Your monitor's refresh rate is the frequency it updates the image on screen — in this case 100 times per second. Your PC can render a game at any framerate regardless of your monitor, but you might want to cap it at 100 FPS to avoid screen tearing and to save power/noise.  This does mean that occasionally both CPUs will be cut off at 100 FPS. But I don't think that's a compelling reason to get the 9700X in this case, especially when the 7800X3D is the same price.",Neutral
Intel,"100 hz is fine for most, especially with the 5060ti and ultrawide monitor. There are higher refresh rate monitors but I think for most people, monitors that VRR is a more important feature to consider when upgrading..",Positive
Intel,"Yes.  And the 9700X generally is cooler than the 7800X3D if you're not trying to do complicated overclocking. The ""standard"" overclock of the 9700X gets it to about 105W.",Neutral
Intel,"You're asking is an affordable cooler good enough. Yes. But you'll still see 95c spikes unless you limit it bc that's what it's designed to do.  The better cooling solution the better the boost for the 9700x.  You don't need to care about the best just what you can budget.  For the 7800x3d you'll rarely see above 80 even its maxed 89. It's designed to be voltage and heat gimped, and it's a sandwich design so even with better cooler you won't see much cooler or performance difference",Neutral
Intel,Which one is better😂 I’m thinking of getting the 5080 for $250 more,Neutral
Intel,"Please don't do that to yourself. The arrival of the Supers isn't much far off, and nvidia has kind of realized their mistake. The 9000 series turned out to be much better so they couldn't shovel the same 16 gb vram cards for over 1k a pop. You'll lose even more money when you try to sell that for the updated version.   The 5080 16gb will be an excellent buy at reduced pricing when the Supers roll around. 700 to 750 easily. Look at all those folks who bought the 5070ti for 1000 usd now.",Negative

I have the stock cooler of a 3900X on my Plex server and it definitely gets the job done with no concern! :)  If you would like to consider an aftermarket cooler, the [Thermalright Peerless Assassin](https://www.amazon.com/Thermalright-Peerless-Assassin-120-Cooler/dp/B09LGY38L4?th=1) has incredible performance at a great price.  Regarding your fan question, that's ultimately up to you. Some people want maximum airflow, some people can't stand the noise that can come with a tower full of fans spinning, some people don't care either way. But yeah, I would recommend 2 fans in the front for intake and one for exhaust. Which I guess is the default configuration. It's a solid little case, but fan options are real limited.",Positive

Intel,"Don't need PCIe 5. It just supports it, which is kind of useless at the moment for gamers. More so people who are going to be running local AI on their machines.",Negative
Intel,"PCI-E 5 is backwards compatible with 4, 4 is compatible with 3, etc. If you run a PCI-E 5 card in a PCI-E 4 slot, you'll just have slightly reduced performance, if any reduction at all. Most GPU's never completely utilize the power available within the slot. Check out some of the benchmark videos comparing the performance difference when gaming.",Neutral
Intel,I have changed the GPU! Thank you for your advice!,Positive
Intel,"Yes, its viable but 110$ sounds a bit much",Neutral
Intel,"My kids have 10400 with a 1660 super. Runs great, although nothing heavier than Genshin Impact and Minecraft.",Positive
Intel,All the other comments are correct but i wanna ask. How old is that monitor? You can probably get a used 1080p one for pretty cheap,Neutral
Intel,They had a 6500XT on Woot for like 80$,Neutral
Intel,Ripoff for $110,Neutral
Intel,I am using one and it's good enough. I am not gaming on 4k 240hz but I am happy with what the gpu does.,Positive
Intel,its better than what you have and for 50 you can't go wrong really...,Positive
Intel,"$50 is fine, make the trade, saves you headache. AMD has dropped game optimization support for 5000 and 6000 series Radeon cards. 1660 super came out same time as the 5000 series and NVIDIA is keeping support up for now.",Neutral
Intel,I mean it is more than double your current performance with more vram but the rx 5700xt can be commonly had for around 100$ used and is almost 50% faster than the 1660 super and with 8gb of vram instead. Although at 720p it might be overkill for your use case given the CPU you have. Not a bad deal at 50$ tbh especially since the gtx 1050 is basically worthless at this point.,Positive
Intel,"That's a bit much for a 1660s, most 10 series 50, 60 and 70 rang cards aren't expensive now. But I would look for RTX2060, where I live used ones start from 90-100euro. At 720p it will be a much better boost, plus DLSS4",Neutral
Intel,"I ran a 10400F + 1660 Super until a few months ago. It was struggling with UE5 games so much that I just got a new PC outright.  In any case, the lowest-end GPU I'd recommend in 2025 is an RX 6600 XT or an RTX 2060 Super. Anything less and you're basically settling for playing only old games.  ALSO VERY IMPORTANT: That 720p monitor (768p I assume) most likely DOES NOT have a digital input like HDMI or DisplayPort. The 1660 Super ONLY has digital outputs, maybe DVI on certain models. Make sure that the GPU and Monitor are compatible, because I sure didn't account for that back in 2019 when I got an RX 570, and had to ALSO spend money on a 1080p monitor with HDMI support instead of keeping my old 1366x768 VGA monitor.",Neutral
Intel,"Yes as long as you are 1080p gaming and do not expect to run the absolute newest and most demanding games of the past couple years. I’ve been using a gtx 1660ti since 2021 and I love it. It also overclocks to the moon perfectly stable. I’ve got +150 on the core, +1300 on the memory at 110% power limit. It will happily go higher, but I stopped there as I wanted the temp under load to stay under 75c.  Edit: that overclock worked out to about 10% more fps in games for me  Also, not sure if your 1050ti requires a power connector but the 1660s does so make sure you have one. Your power supply should be fine though, as that card usually draws 100w at most.",Positive
Intel,My 1660 super still feels good enough with today's games. Other than Indiana Jones. All other games run well enough for me. Busy with ARC Raiders and BF6 at the moment.,Positive
Intel,"16 series is fantastic for last gen, mostly useless for current gen.  But its much much more balanced in line with your CPU than a 1050ti is and that trade seems like a fine deal as long as everything works",Positive
Intel,"Honestly I was using a 1660 and a 1080 for way longer than I should have but it runs like all games on really really decent settings as long as you aren't playing modern AAA games. If you've got the extra money, a newer card is better of course though",Positive
Intel,"It depends on what you're expecting. It'll run most games. RT only games won't run. It's a decent card and my older brother still uses it in his build for some racing games and shooters. But if you're looking to play all the latest games like indiana jones and doom the dark ages, I'd save a bit more money and get something newer with more vram.",Neutral
Intel,"It's not.  At the very least I would get the 2060. It's only 20% more performance in raster, but, crucially, it can run DLSS - which is gonna be another 20-30% more performance, even at that resolution.",Neutral
Intel,If you're curious about how much more performance you'll be getting compared to your old 1050ti check out this video. It's a straight really good upgrade for you at $50. You'd probably be able to play at 1080p at a mostly stable 60fps depending on the game and settings. Especially older games no problem.  https://youtu.be/N8i-neXsMH8  It's perfectly viable. Contrary to what a lot of people say you don't have to always have the newest and best tech if your expectations aren't sky high. And it's still a far better deal for you at the moment than buying an entire new PC.  And here's a 1660 super running Arc Raiders. It runs amazing for how well the game looks.  https://youtu.be/h_31FmStPuY,Positive
Intel,Decent card for 1080p gaming in older last gen games. It's too slow for modern releases.,Neutral
Intel,It will be a good boost in performance for 50$.,Positive
Intel,"if the deal is legit and you are sure that there wont be any funny business, i'd say that its a no brainer   you will see a noticeable increase in your PC's output. if [https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1660S-Super-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti/4056vs3649](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-1660S-Super-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1050-Ti/4056vs3649) is correct, you would be facing 94% increase in your graphical output   congratulations beforehand",Neutral

Intel,"Don't expect much a performance difference.... yeah its better, but it still wont handle even slightly modern titles very well. You'd be much better off saving up a little bit more money and find9ng something newer.",Negative
Intel,"Sheer willpower, I've not played too many games I wanted, earliest being RDR2. I actually wanted to get a new GPU just when miners peaked, then 'Rona happened, then I hit financial low. Used market was also horrid. Only with 40 series and now 50 series am I able to buy a GPU. Last year I almost rage bought a 4060 lol Now I'm aiming for a 5070",Neutral
Intel,"Viable because the RTX 3050 is an absolute shit deal of a card. It’s slightly lower than a 1660 Super on average. Its only upsides are DLSS, Frame Gen, and longer driver support.  For $50, the 1660 Super is a steal, and OP is able to get rid of their old GPU in the process too. It’s two birds with one stone.",Negative
Intel,6GB or 8GB?  The 1660 Super is better than a 3050 6GB anyways.,Positive
Intel,"I went from a 1050ti to a 1660 super a few years ago. And it gave me plenty of extra performance. My wife still uses that card to game at 1080p, and she has had no complaints so far. You just have to be ready to lower your settings.  Biggest downside is the lack of dlss.",Negative
Intel,What does she play?,Neutral
Intel,"When she first build the pc she played a lot of Hogwarts legacy. Which ran great. She also plays satisfactory.  I also used it to play games like Cyberpunk, HZD and Metro Exodus on (I think) at least medium. And I used a 1440p monitor.  I know a 1660 super is far from the newest or best cars. But it still performs ok in most modern titles as long as you dont expect to much and lower the settings. And I think for 50, it can be a decent deal.",Positive
Intel,"Try it. Some of the older games are probably fine, newer probably not.  In any case a dedicated gaming desktop PC would definitely be a much better experience. But you don’t have to go crazy. Around $1200 is the sweet spot IMO. Check the sidebar for resources and guides.",Positive
Intel,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ptRLMB4m2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ptRLMB4m2I) he tested your exact CPU & iGPU and overall it looks playable depends on what your standard of playable means (with 1080p, around 40fps, no 60fps unfortunately). Most of the games you mentioned has upscaling tech like FSR/XESS that you can use in the graphic settings of each game to further improve the performance (basically playing the game in less than 1080p then upscale it to 1080p).     But if what you want is a 1080p stable 60fps for now and for the future, you definitely need something more than what you have right now. 1080p 60fps is easy to achieve with less than 700USD budget. Even more lower if you are confident in buying used parts",Neutral

Often times you will see pre-built pcs, or shops scamming their customers by selling them ancient hardware for the same price as a new pc.",Positive
Intel,"since you said you have enough money to get a PC, do that, treat yourself with a decent setup, it would be a million times better than playing on a laptop, especially the games you mentioned, if you can share your budget im sure we can figure out a good PC for those games, you won't need anything crazy i promise haha, all mid range pc combinations are able to run all those very well",Positive
Intel,"When it comes to pc game, there are so many variables.  Graphics setting, resolution, upscaling, genre of game and perceived smoothness of different FPS all contribute to how well a game run for you.  It is really hard to tell without trying.    For an integrated gpu, yours is by no means weak, but it still cannot compare to modern discrete gpu.  Generally, anything in or before ps4 era(i.e released before 2020 ) should run fine with minimum graphics setting at 1080p with fsr / xess upscaling. It should safely run at 30fps or above (i.e. as smooth or smoother than ps4 game)  Anything newer you will have to either watch benchmark on youtube, try the demo or benchmark tool of the game(some games offer this).  Steam also support refund of games played in less than 2 hours and purchased less than 2 weeks.  But don’t do that too much or you will be denied the refund.",Neutral
Intel,Those are pretty good specs for a laptop i would think it would be fine but i only play on desktop. Laptop components arent as good because its harder to keep them cool,Positive
Intel,"I think personally you should build a pc! As long as your budget allows it you can get something for around 600 bucks on facebook marketplace, or you can build with used parts off of facebook marketplace.   If you want recommendations I’ll give you some:  Ryzen 5 5900x (180ish used)  RX6700xt (200ish bucks used)  Asus b450-f motherboard (50 - 100 bucks used)  32gb ddr4 ram whatever you’d like, probably Corsair though. (80-100ish)  PSU 650W (something reputable like Corsair) (90 bucks)  You can find good air coolers for the cpu for under 50 bucks just do research.   You’re looking at 680 bucks on the high end but definitely can find parts to fit a cheaper budget. Feel free to message me and I’d be glad to help you find something.  Edit: this is what you should expect as far as performance, you should expect with these exact specs to be able to play currently all games on high settings, competitive or first person shooters tend to run better than single player games in my experience, I’d expect 120+ frames on 1080p, or even higher than that if you drop your settings. As far as single player games, you should be able to max out most games and get a solid 60fps which is fine for single player.",Positive

Cpu, motherboard and ram need to be bought together, but a decent power supply can last for years as can your case and monitor. I'm an old guy who has been building PCs for myself and kids for around 20 years.   Get a mid tower case with good air flow and a quality PSU.  I'd look at website recommendations for the best bang for your buck AMD BUILD for your cpu and motherboard recommendations , get 2 sticks of 16 gig ram., a 1 tb M2 ssd as a system drive, and dump the rest into the GPU.   27 inch monitors are fairly cheap now, and you can get whatever keyboard and mouse you want.",Positive

Intel,"It is a pretty questionable HTPC build tbh. You definitely should’ve allocated more money to the GPU.   14700 is a pricey chip, I’m sure the 14600k is cheaper and you easily could’ve power limited it in bios. Alternatively a 14400 would’ve been fine too.  As well I went ddr4 with my build and it was quite a bit cheaper.   Sf750 for this build is super overkill. It’s a great PSU, I have 2 of them, but they are very pricey.   Just the cost of fans you probably could’ve gotten a 9060xt as well.",Negative

As for the PSU, while a 750-watt PSU isn’t strictly necessary, it’s 2025 and with GPUs continuing to demand more power, I wouldn’t go any lower. With the way this build is set up, I’d only need to upgrade the GPU in a few years, and that’s only if I choose to turn it into a gaming PC. The fans, been using Noctua fans for many years and I wouldn’t touch anything else.",Neutral
Intel,Lol sorry mb. But you should mention that somewhere,Neutral
Intel,What does media center pc mean in your context? For me my HTPC is being used like a gaming pc for my TV.   Also Intel is very good with idle power draw but make sure you’ve limited the boost wattage. For me I’ve limited my 14500 to 95w on short bursts. The 14700 should have a higher base boost power.,Neutral
Intel,"I mean just watching movies, listening to music, streaming and video encoding. No gaming.  I also have a 14500, a 14700K, and another 14700 in three other PCs. Those are gaming systems, and I’ve found that when set to Intel default settings, they average around 60–65 degrees during gaming without me needing to enforce power limits, since Intel default settings enforce them automatically.  Edit: 60–65 degrees for the non-K CPUs. My 14700K runs more like 70–75 degrees. Honestly, I much prefer the non-K 14700, since in my benchmarks it performed only 3–5% lower, yet ran cooler and used less power. Not like anyone overclocks these days anyway.",Neutral

Intel,"AMD have clarified their original stupid as fuck statement mate. Apparently what the utterly inept fuckwads in their marketing department were MEANT to say, according to the engineers, is that any NEW software tech that's developed from now on, will only be available for 7000 series and up GPU's. RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.   It just means that if AMD develop anything new, like FSR4, it won't be made backward compatible with older cards. A lot of us have been saying for years that AMD's entire marketing team should be fired, and replaced with people from the engineering department, because this level of fuck up is literally so common that their nickname these days is ""Advanced Marketing Department"", and not in a good way.",Negative

Intel,"Intel: lets pretend dx11 never existed, lets just optimize our drivers for the latest and lamest of titles (cybershit 77 onwards).   Btw many ppl buy midrange cards to enjoy older, well made titles at silky smooth frametimes and sky high fps, everything on ultra of course. Thats where intel sucks big time",Negative
Intel,"I mean, i am rooting for more competition, but which nvidia card burns the cables? Is it the top of the range? That one does not have an AMD counterpart anyways..",Neutral
Intel,"AMD makes cpus as their primarly source of income and their discrete desktop gpus as a side thing. Nvidia was a gpu company, now its a self proclaimed AI company.",Neutral

Intel,Their marketing team is certainly one that gives the vibes of 100% nepo appointments.,Negative
Intel,"The Advanced Marketing department thing comes from that deranged weirdo at UBM, if memory serves, and the irony is that he makes that joke to imply that they are only good at marketing, but bad at creating products, which is the literal inverse of reality. AMD's products are pretty good, but jesus christ on a cracker is their market utterly horrendous",Negative
Intel,This makes perfect sense with redstone supposedly coming this year of course they were going to split the driver stack. Terrible communication aside this seems pretty obvious,Negative
Intel,I hope thats what AMD will actually do and not just PR corporate bullshit meant to save face. Still kinda sucks that 6000 series will never get official FSR 4 support unlike the 2000 series getting DLSS 4 which is a massive improvement.,Negative
Intel,So kind of like microsofts feature support vs extended support  You don't get the new shiny but we fix what you already have  I suppose you'd only see over time if that's a big deal or not. Personally I do like products having at least some on no new features extended support. That way if a new feature brakes things it isn't one of the final patches you see(How long that should be I'm not sure),Neutral

Intel,"Except they say “New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by **market needs**…”  Basically, Game Optimizations will be released on an inconsistent basis with new drivers, which is still a baffling decision considering RDNA2 marketed optimizations as a selling point 3 years ago.  I expect BARE MINIMUM 6 1/2 years of consistent game optimizations, not 5.",Negative
Intel,Why does AMD even have a marketing team when Reddit and Youtube does it for free and does it 500 times better?,Neutral
Intel,"Honestly their marketing pissed me off when FSR4 was released and they were like "" sooooo we arent bringing that to the 7000xtx after all"".",Negative
Intel,"It's still pretty dumb: if eg. FSR4 or any new feature set can improve the performance of an older card, without an inherently crapton of additional massaging, it should be made to do so. And reportedly, FSR4 has already been shown to work on and improve performance of these older generation RDNA cards in modded drivers, so it has been demonstrated that the only obstacle in implementing it is a profit-seeking one. Though saying that is there not profit in providing value for customers on older hardware, doesn't that build the brand, etc. or are they just interested in pushing the next generation of eWaste into the bin sooner.",Neutral

Intel,It's amazing how bad their marketing department is.,Negative
Intel,"Advanced marketing devices is exactly how userbenchmark calls amd, but in the opposite meaning  As in their marketing by sponsoring every single youtuber on earth accomplished their desktop cpus to be bought by gamers more than intel",Neutral
Intel,Oh damn. Thats absolutely not what i thought that announcement was. Thats totally reasonable. Were the marketing department about to do share buybacks or something. Because that level of incompetence would kill people in any blue collar job.,Negative

Intel,AMD wasting money on these marketing people smh.,Negative
Intel,Yeah userbenchmark has been giving that marketing department WAY too much credit lmfao,Negative
Intel,">is that any NEW software tech that's developed from now on, will only be available for 7000 series and up GPU's  Well that's disappointing. It's way too soon. I'm sure it's not just due to hardware limitations, since 6000 and 7000 share similar hardware necessary for upscaling. They can't throw that ""we drop support because compatibility blah blah"" card on consumers.  Well on a positive note, it's good that 6000 series will still get FSR4 support thru mods, although that might be limited, as some online games could trigger anticheats.",Neutral
Intel,That just sounds like BS from AMD.   Why come out and say something you already said. What this sounds like is AMD trying to back peddle a decision that would cost them future sales. The best part is if they get this out there now. Then oops don't update for games moving forward. Then no one will say a word. It will be done and over with.   Everyone knew FSR4 and the like wasn't coming to RDNA1/2 gpu's they said this before. They don't back port new stuff anyway.   So just more corpo speak for hey we screwed up now forget bout it look a shiny thing consumer look at the shiny.,Negative
Intel,Which I feel like they didn’t need to say? Like obviously not every feature is going to be supported an older hardware already right now FSR 4 is not available on the 7000 series though the rumour is they will have it eventually. Like why is this something the end user needs to be informed about?   I almost wonder if they were planning on pulling Support and then just decided to say that it was misinterpreted because they saw the reaction,Negative
Intel,"> RDNA1 and RDNA2 GPU's will continue to receive the same game ready style drivers as they always have.  Where did they say that. All I've found is:  >""New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch""  Which isn't the same thing at all.",Neutral

Intel,"It's ironic because it's a sub for PC master race, but as a PC gamer it's like the biggest sub I avoid lol. You'll see something posted all over the sub about how it's bad, and then next week its vice versa.",Negative
Intel,"I'm pretty sure the clarification had a big asterisk of something along the lines ""we will continue updating them according to market demand"", i think they're still moving them to maintenance mode the same they did for Polaris and Vega which means they will continue necessary bug and security fixes, unlikely to recieve optimizations (tho still possible) but more importantly no new features will be added, this kinda sucks when you consider RTX 20 series which is older than RDNA2 is still receiving partial support for new DLSS features.",Negative
Intel,the original message was slightly ambiguous but then literally every news outlet choose to interpret it in the very worst way possible and then add clickbait headlines on top of that misinterpretation. The resulting mess is only marginally AMD's fault.  They aren't saying anything now that wasn't in what they said originally.,Negative
Intel,"""New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch.""   Isn't the marketing department the one responsible to judge ""market needs""? Not looking good.",Neutral
Intel,"this is proof that all the AMD hate is extremely forced and happens no matter what they do, they could launch an 24GB GPU for 400 dollars and people would point at it as a reason no to buy Radeon.",Negative
Intel,The updates AMD meant: Games will be playable.   The updates PCMR expect: Future AI upscaling support on old cards.,Neutral
Intel,"It did recieve AFMF and Anti lag 2, but now they pulled the plug and new features won't be added even if they can work on these cards. People should care, nvidia is still shipping new DLSS features to 2018 and 2019 GPUs, we can't be normalizing AMD pulling the plug on feature updates for 3-5 years old cards.",Negative
Intel,"Same, I don't give a shit about shiny new things I just want it to be stable.",Negative
Intel,Help yourself by installing fsr4 int8 with optiscaler. Is game changer for my rx 6800,Positive
Intel,"the cards function and gets updates, which is more than people are giving them credit for, proof that the HAte train never stops because people love to do free marketing at any chance for Nvidia, even if it hurts them in the eyes of people with brains. which is unreasonably hard to come across these days.",Positive

Intel,"At least one 5070Ti did, but it’s certainly less common than the 5080/5090",Neutral
Intel,My buddy's 9070 uses the 12 pin and it hasn't melted either. I think it's partially the wattage of the higher end cards running into the very tiny safety margins that's the issue. The cables a have a lot more breathing room in the mid range.,Neutral
Intel,you need to educate then. its EVERY card with a 12VHPWR that is melting. including the 9070XTs that come with it.,Neutral

Intel,"Why are you pissed? Amd clarified that they messed up with communication. 60 series cards will still get game ready drivers, just not new tech that comes out. So if/when fsr4 happens, 60 series cards won’t get it. That’s it.",Negative
Intel,"Cable issue is due to a well known, incredibly well documented design flaw that has been detailed by people like DerBauer.

Your friend will be just fine, his card will still get game updates. You're zero for two at the moment.",Negative

Take a guess where I was lol.   Nepo/crony hires are the worst because they are like the only ppl in the company that can get away with being totally inept.   This does not excuse AMD though since they are way past the point.

They believed it enough that they actually let some performance out of the bag and into the market... otherwise they would have released a crappier card on purpose, because that is legitimately what NVIDIA do without any real competition: hold back technology and dribble it out in ever crappier improvements year on year.  AI is cool, but apart from GPT doing my spreadsheets for me (which costs OpenAI far more than my subscription) , it's made every single product it's integrated in worse.  It's already at the point where a customer faced with the choice between AI assistant integrated VS vocally proclaiming no AI...they will pick the one without AI because it's just data harvesting guff.

No different than the Dot Com bubble or Mobile App bubble or social media bubble. Some companies like OpenAI or Google or Anthropic will ""win"", they'll buy up any startup/smaller company that actually shows promise (or potentially has promise and would deny competitors the engineers working there) then the market will calcify.

Intel,"Data Centers use a lot of power, and there's more demand for data centers than before, but this isn't a specific to AI problem. I've ran local LMs (Llama primarily) on my own server, they're not significantly harder or demanding to run than a typical server. Per the UPS I have attached to it, that single server uses around 200-400W the average is around 1700kW/h per year, and this is a fairly inefficient homelab.   Image/Video generation on the other hand, requires a lot more processing power, as anyone who's worked VFX will tell you, but this isn't the bulk of work that LLMs are doing. It's also why AI was able to ""pop up"" on every site so quickly, as it's really not significantly more intensive for Cloud providers than most K8S systems. This isn't a _pro_ AI comment btw, just noting that the power consumption aspect is a bit of misinformation that companies like OpenAI are _themselves_ pushing as if they make it seem too intensive to ""get in"" at this point, they solidify themselves as the defacto winner of the AI bubble. It's also why they recently have started bringing up ""ethical concerns"" about data theft and wanting regulation on data scraping...because they've already scraped everything.

Intel,"Look at the amount of money going into AI, and then the amount of revenue being generated by AI. The difference is insane, and I see no realistic path to profitability.

Intel,"That's updating an existing feature, though, as the 3060 already supports DLSS4.  An actual *new* feature would be something like Nvidia enabling DLSS frame generation on the 30 series; something it doesn't currently officially support.  It seems like it's kinda splitting hairs, but that's what the whole AMD thing is/was about: People thinking that ""no new features"" means the same thing as ""no updates"".

Intel,"It's was a tech bubble in the US in the late 90s. Basically startups were popping up and getting investors just to start online businesses or websites, so you'd have huge purchases or investments in new companies that were basically just ""noun"" + "".com"" (the ending to our website addresses in the US at the time).  You had ridiculous stuff pop up nearly everyday and get investment, and then in 2-3 years the investors (and the companies) realized they had no way to actually make money, so the bubble burst.  You can look up articles and videos on it by searching for ""Dot Com Bubble"", it's often discussed.  Ironically, many of the failed businesses' ideas are a profitable thing now, and similar websites and companies exist - but the fact was the infrastructure and demand just wasn't there 25 years ago.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah, but we're talking about Nvidia. So they'll still be in the AI game for as long as AI exists. So the bubble bursting will never bankrupt Nvidia, only companies buying from Nvidia. The point is that Nvidia is never leaving the AI game now, because they are THE source of the hardware for AI.",Neutral
Intel,"The overreaction are indeed crazy. But that being said, Nvidias stock is so absurdly high due to their profit margins and sales volume.

Intel,Are you even listening to me?,Negative
Intel,"yeah, that's true, 100% a big downside, if you happen to play games where that matters. i didn't even know fortnite had kernel level anticheat, because i'm lucky enough that all the games i play don't require that.  i think it's a market saturation thing. if a significant enough part of the user base switched (steam deck is helping a lot there), the developers would have to adjust their anticheat solutions eventually. since kernel level anticheat still doesn't effectively prevent cheating anyway, i think it's just a current trend that will eventually go away again.",Negative
Intel,"uh because its not supported?, or you thinking you have a gotcha moment because fg is obviously not supported on 3000 series and below.  I might have not been clear but the 3000 series and below can actually benefit from the upscaling of the transformer model.",Negative

If A380, A580 and A770 ​were released during the mining craze at reasonable prices it would be a huge hit and butterfly effect would change the rest with b580 competing against 6600xt and 3060 not against 7600 and 4060.   Maybe also not wasting die space on RT but only on upscaling ​and focusing on pcie 3.0 x16 and such stuff.",Neutral

Intel,"Eh, I'm not convinced that Intel is any better than AMD or Nvidia.   Also, when I went GPU shopping last they didn't have any offerings at the 5070ti/9070xt range.  Maybe they'll be competitive by the next time I'm upgrade shopping.",Negative

Intel,So you buy from the CPU villain :'),Neutral
Intel,"I'm not in any camp. I'd have to say that AMD is offering decent value and has given consumers what they wanted. They've done stupid and questionable marketing for their products but if you do your research the price to performance is there.   Remember 10 years ago when gamers were asking for more cores and Intel was like nope, you get 4 cores. Nvidia was similar with memory until recently. 3070 with 8gb of memory.  I'd but arc of they had a product that meets my need at the price point I want.",Neutral

Intel,How quickly people forget about Intel stagnating CPUs for nearly a decade... all of these tech companies are shitty in their own way.

Intel,"Everyone likes to talk, but no one wants to put their money where their mouth is.",Negative
Intel,"Maybe if there are options worth a damn (see: exist whatsoever) in affordable price ranges then we could.   But let's be really fuckin honest: there are only AMD and Nvidia for GPU, and while Lisa Su has done great work on the CPU side the GPU is still massively behind Nvidia overall, and honestly the prices don't reflect that gap properly.   So for many gamers, Nvidia is the only practical option. Nvidia know it, the price reflects that, and their QA/Design reflects the lack of competition in how it's becoming more common to hear of cards burning out due to shoving higher and higher voltage requirements rather than going for efficiency gains.",Negative
Intel,"So buy a GPU that's slower than the one on my phone from the company that milked me for 10 years straight on their oven CPUs? Nah, mate, I'll skip.",Negative
Intel,"Buy the best price to performance ratio within your budget and target performance. It won't help the competition to go with any brand no matter their market share. If everyone goes for the best price, then they have to compete on the price. Don't overcomplicate it.",Neutral
Intel,"Literally the only way this might change is if China manages to produce cards / processors on par with these 3 American companies.  Or at least slightly underperforming but cheaper with proper support.  Not that they'd be more pro consumer but there's no difference between these 3. Not to mention they literally invest in eachother and plan to be more and more dependant on themselves.  And even then, aside from maybe initial market entry, it would most likely end up the same unless they'd start taking over non us markets with competitive pricing.",Neutral
Intel,It doesn't matter if you buy from AMD or Nvidia or even Intel at this point. 95% of their customer base is other large businesses. The individual consumer is no longer a factor in any of the decisions they make it. We are in a end-stage capitalism bubble where the primary market is now other large businesses.

So who wants to buy a GPU from a company like that?   Whenever AMD is at least competitive with Nvidia I buy the AMD option because I do want to support the underdog but only if the product is close in performance and quality, which many times in history they have been, better even a couple times.",Negative

Intel,"Buy whichever you can afford that meets your needs and enjoy it for a few years. The whole rooting for xyz is only good if it means competition and change, but if all 3 of them are cunts to the max. Intel is currently in a favorable light to me, because they are putting in a decent amount of work in to the arc drivers despite having marginal error marked share. Btw, intel is apparently selling out the GPU chips and board partners want more, but intel just isn't making more... some kind of nintendo move right there.",Neutral
Intel,"Don’t worry guys, imma make my own gpu",Negative

Intel,Been tempted to buy an ARC for my old system. But then again Intel plans on killing ARC,Negative
Intel,"I guess you weren’t around when we Intel served us less than 10% gains per each generation of CPU and just upped the power consumption, because they couldn’t bother to innovate and kept beating the 14nm dead horse?  This only changed when AMD made a miraculous comeback from the bulldozer disaster and brought us the now legendary AM4 Ryzen dynasty.   Intel is a prime example what happens when the MBA bean counters take over and set the product engineering direction.  May Intel go rot in hell.",Negative

Intel,"All THREE have shown the capability of doing horrendous shit to their customers.  I think, having only '3' brands to choose from is the problem, since all 3 have decided to play with us.  BUT Intel GPUs are cheap with so little demand (Arc B580 is $249 USD on Amazon right now) so maybe I can spare $250 to 'test' and add to the market share, play around with it a little... Idk, it might be a better secondary than my old RTX 2080 Super. Not that I have disposable income, but it's still 'voting with my wallet.'  AMD needs their shit called out every now and then, but they're a way different company than the AMD that sold me an R9 280 without making it obvious I was going to need extra shit to run 3 monitors on what was, at the time, a very good GFX card. My 7800 XT has been such a good experience having the extra headroom for VRAM. Had some hiccups at first that I probably wouldn't have had if I bought an RTX, but I fixed it the same day by updating the driver.  They make bad decisions sometimes, but I feel way more confident AMD will listen to my feedback than NVidia, and that is why I made my purchasing choice the way I did. Also, 16GB of VRAM had at least something to do with it lol.",Negative
Intel,Basically there isn't any large tech company that makes PC hardware that isn't anti-consumer.,Negative
Intel,Only buy used,Neutral
Intel,I only buy NVIDIA because I have stock in them and also because the GPU names are understandable as to which ones are newer and better than older ones.,Positive
Intel,"so 6% customers vs 94% and some how we must choose this 0%. In my country the market share is 90% nvidia, no intel at all. Did we already forget about intel monopoly for decades ? 5-7% uplift every year in the cpu segment? now they're good guys in gpu? nah..",Negative
Intel,Is OP turbo stupid? Intel is the worst one out of the 3. Intel is historically known for being the most anti consumer pieces of shit for the past 40 years.... and now that they cant make a good product we have strange bootlickers telling us to support that shit company????,Negative

Intel,"All three are anti-consumer, Nvidia being the most out of the three (and that a high bar given Intel almost bankrupted AMD by brbing OEMs).

Intel needs to release more powerful cards if they want them in more hands. Id gladly fork out the cash for an Intel card but they are no where near matching my 7900xtx or even my 3080 in my side rig.  While I like having another competitor in the PC space, they offer nothing on the table for a good amount of potential buyers.",Negative
Intel,The irony is that Intel has been so anti consumer for so long that they lost all their market share to AMD and Nvidia. Now op is begging us to support poor widdle Intel.    Ten years ago you would have been an idiot to build with anything but Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU. Five years ago you would have been reasonable to go AMD all the way. Now people are asking you to please give Intel a chance haha.,Negative

Intel,"The b50/b60 SR-IOV at a low price I think is the first no-brainer product from them...if you have a workload using VMs.  Gaming the drivers have improved a lot from where they were when arc first launched, I think it's a good enough product to weigh them in when you're buying but I'd still only go intel if they were decently cheaper than comparable AMD/Nvidia cards. In my region I've seen some ""Why would anyone ever buy it then?"" prices on intel cards.",Positive
Intel,"Buying the best product is buying based on brand. AMD has the value.   If you ever talk about buying a GPU, chances are you're going to use it for more than excel spreadsheets.

Intel,"Yeah, its just picking which anti-consumerism you want more, or comparing anti-consumerism to see which hurts less.  For example:  \[Personally, i still would like to go with AMD but that depends if they make some promises or good clarifications on the drivers fiasko.\]  NVIDIA Pro's  * Best performance * Best features, CUDA and Ray Tracing due to their market lead. * Excellent driver support overall, 1660 lost support just this month and 2 years after the card was discontinued. Thats 6 years of driver support, and they still promise 2 or 3 more years of security updates, which is 9 years of support total.  NVIDIA Cons  * Melty Connector * Drivers for DX12 suck for linux * Overpriced * Low VRAM's compared to competition  AMD Pros  * Good value for money * More vram overall * Better linux support  AMD Cons  * No new high end cards * Shooting themselves in the foot, like with driver support. big pr damage * Constantly playing catchup to NVIDIA, refusing to do their own thing  Intel Pro  * Turns the number 2 into 3. * Excellent value for money * Boatload of VRAM * Improves very quickly  Intel Con  * Drivers suck and development is focused on new games.

So they have ethernet chipsets that work in Windows client editions (like Windows 11, etc)  that won't work with Windows Server, as the driver is coded to explicitly block installing on the latter.   The V vs LM gigabit chipsets are a prime example.

RDNA1 and 2 is shoved into the ""stability"" orientated driver development branch, which just means no day one optimizations unlike Intel and Nvidia for its graphics cards. So overall worse drivers for 95% of gamers.  Just to compare, RDNA2 gpu's are still sold worldwide and AMD moved them to basically security updates. 1660ti was discontinued 2 years ago and JUST NOW NVIDIA  have swapped to security updates and promise them for 3 more years.       With AMD and this ""confusion"" i might get a more efficient gpu, but so what if it gets less efficient but ""more stable"" drivers.",Negative
Intel,"I don't think it was.  AMD are doing damage control and have made several non committal statements about the cards receiving updates 'as the market requires' or something like that.  But the reality is that they have still cut off RDNA1 and RDNA2 into this separate 'maintenance' branch.  Whatever they might say now, and whatever assurances they give, their original intention should be very clear to everyone, this wasn't a mistake and they didn't do this to provide these cards with better support or features.  They are simply limiting support for cards which are still being sold, which is absolutely atrocious.  It's not the first time AMD has tried some bullshit like this, but up until now I always considered them the lesser of the two evils between them and Nvidia, but now that's not going to factor into any buying decision I make.",Negative

Intel,"I waited to get into it until 2022 and started playing it on a 3060Ti.  The Overdrive/path tracing update convinced me to upgrade to a 4090 and it was honestly worth it. I'm a bit of graphics nerd and writing a real-time rasterised engine was my favourite university project (I ended up expanding it with shadow maps and deferred shading with SSAO for the final grade, which was way more than required for a single person), so seeing how far path tracing has come was absolutely spectacular.  Computer graphics are in a bit of an odd spot for me, where the performance of a lot of games with more conventional techniques is quite disappointing, but path tracing at the very high end is a true generational leap that we haven't seen in a long time. Like, on the level of introducing real-time lighting and shadows maps in the super early days of real-time 3D rendering.  I would say the biggest issue right now is that a lot of development has been put into making graphics *dynamic* again (baked light maps are very performant solutions to global illumination, but also enforced highly static worlds, whereas ray tracing can be fully dynamic), while the state of game development still hasn't really caught up with that. Doom TDA used it to enhance level destruction in some fun ways, and AC:Shadows used it for base building. But the true capability of real-time global illumination is far beyond that.",Positive

Intel,"As a B580 owner, you make good points, but everything depends on price. Markets around the world are crazy different, I got mine below 250 dollars where I live, as the 9060xt 8 GB was above 300, and so was the 5060. I also have a Ryzen 5 5600x and I can assure you, the CPU overhead thing is overblown. There's only one game I played where it was a thing and that is CS2, which is instantly fixable by using Vulkan instead of DirectX 11. As long as your CPU supports Rebar and PCIe 4.0, you're good to go. Intel also recently announced Xess 3.0 which also has full support for older cards including MFG. Although Intel hasn't made any comparative pictures between versions, I expect Xess 3.0 to make things a little tighter with DLSS and FSR 4. Also, although nowadays you can get around the 8 GB limitation by dropping the settings a bit, in the future games can get heavy enough that perhaps you'll have to drop them way too much to get stable performance. Modern games easily use 7 GB on high settings, imagine what they'll do in a couple of years. Then you'll have to either play the games on very low settings or expect a huge performance drop from the lack of VRAM.",Neutral
Intel,It's obvious that you heard one thing 2 years ago and just stuck with it if you still think there's any significant difference between xess and other frame generation software. Why are you comparing the B580 and the 9060xt? They're not even in the same price bracket. Get real,Negative
Intel,"well i havent had any driver issues with my B580 apart from one game le mans ultimate which crashes frequently on arc cards so idk.   i dont really know why youre comparing new products in price to performance to old products, any card will lose in this situation.  also intel isnt according to them ending the GPU division, i mean it makes absolutely no sense after investing billions and years of R&D into something to just kill it 3 years in",Negative
Intel,"Not in my opinion, they have backtracked and made several non committal statements.  But the reality is they have moved RDNA1/2 into a separate 'maintenence' driver branch. And they didn't do that so that they can spend extra time and effort onto those, clearly their priority is the newer cards.  Having priority on newer products is fine but it shouldn't be at the cost of products that you are still manufacturing / selling.",Negative

Intel,"All in all - B580 is not bad, it is a very good GPU.   I was just disagreeing with the take that B580 being ""better than what AMD and Nvidia offer at the $250 price range"", I think its a tradeoff and comes down to personal choice.      ""but everything depends on price"" 100% true.    Where i live - B580 is $70 cheaper than the cheapest 9060xt. so for me B580 would be an obvious choice.      ""CPU overhead thing is overblown"" intel largely fixed it, for zen3-4-5 its ok now in most games, but for older CPUs - the overhead is still heavy.    Here is the worst examples. While someone with 5600 and 9060XT will have no issue in these games, if you have B580 with 5600 - you, rarely, will see some overhead, but with 2600 it's straight up bad in these games.  https://preview.redd.it/1xnwvjzszezf1.png?width=2091&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ff6ab7fb1b4686bfe4fbd79a22014646ad6c6e6  p.s. Personally, I would rather buy a used 3070, etc. and sell it after 1.5 years for almost the same money and then get some new RX10060XT or RTX6060 that, hopefully, would have 16GB VRAM. Cos, IMO, all cheap current gen products are flawed, I see them as GTX1060 3GB.",Positive
Intel,"Yeah, ""still manufacturing / selling"" is the key point here.  1660ti was dropped from production 2 years ago and just now their drivers were moved onto maintenance mode, with that mode promised for 3 years.  It would be one thing if they stopped the product, then later on did what nvidia did, but they keep churning out RDNA2 chips, for example the Asus ROG's and Steam Decks still run on RDNA2 architecture.",Neutral
Intel,"They are, but they aren’t the ones single handedly pumping it up. Nvidia is artificially making feedback deals to increase their net worth and artificially inflate the value of their cards by investing in AI companies as long as those companies buy their cards.   And yes, while you’re right it doesn’t excuse AMD, all companies are going to fuck up and overstep their bounds. It’s your responsibility as a consumer to buy from the lesser of 2 pieces of shit.",Negative
Intel,"that didnt answer my question? why are you comparing used cards to new cards in price to performance? new cards always lose, as for the 9060 XT i guess the US must be a fairytale land cause all 9060XT’s where i live are $330+  if intel really wanted to cut the gpu division why did they just last month bother to release and ship out a new workstation gpu  also driver issues are a minority problem, a majority of players wont encounter driver related problems",Negative

Intel,Arc raider is a great example that UE5 can be good in the hands of good developers. I couldn't tell that it was a UE5 game.,Positive
Intel,"Bf6 does have a flaw regarding high cpu usage. Which was detected in the beta and annoyingly carried over into the final product. There was a fix thankfully, but having to find that on youtube is rather poor. That aside it runs relatively well no crashes for myself unless my undervolt gpu wise is a tad too much. Sad how many titles aren’t done to a decent standard for the cost of them now.",Negative
Intel,"Optimised doesn't just mean high framerates, it means good performance in relation to the tech it's using. Both of those games aren't using intensive RT or PT nor is their general rendering quality pushing boundaries in any way so the fact they run well isn't impressive             E.g. If the original pac-man released now and ran at 120fps on today's budget gaming PCs that would still mean it has awful optimisation even though it runs well",Neutral
Intel,"If I remember correctly Helddivers 2 was 30gb when I installed, it got less optimized over time which is kinda sad tbh",Negative
Intel,HD2 is designed to run quickly on HDD hence the size.  Cod has had file management to reduce file size based on what you want for several years. BO6 mp was like less than 50 gbs total.,Neutral
Intel,Optimization in BF6 is not as good as the other ones which look just as good maybe even better. I have to play this game with low everything or else I go over my 8GB vram limit and Ill start stuttering,Negative
Intel,"its because they didnt over complicate the graphics. neither of the games are truly breathtaking visually from the standpoint of just high detailed textures and lighting. they look amazing, but theres plenty of techniques that the devs used to make the game look good enough, but also run really well. zoom in really close on the textures on ultra settings in Arc and youll see its pretty pixelated, but for things like terrain who cares? stuff like that adds so much.",Positive
Intel,I still feel bf6 ran better during beta on my machines,Positive
Intel,I do think it is a bit dramatic to not use DLSS or upscaling in general nowadays. At 4k and even 1440p I think it is perfectly reasonable to expect some degree of upscaling. Why throw away performance for some relatively minor clarity improvements?   Beyond that I think it is important to remember that optimisation isn’t just making your gaming using cheaper rendering techniques.   I would call Avatar Frontiers of Pandora optimised even if it quite hard to run because it looks very good for the resources it uses and doesn’t have persistent stuttering or other issues along those lines.,Neutral
Intel,call of duty isn't unoptimized,Neutral
Intel,"Battlefield 6 is a polished turd. It may look good visually, but only playing a ton do you see how bad the gunfights feel when someone has slow internet.

Intel,HD2 runs good on older hardware because of the size.,Positive
Intel,I'd like to think it's because they changed their direction but it also could be they just so happened to actually get a talented developer on board.  I've worked in a lot of places and no matter what the people up top want it's really just about if the worker can deliver.,Negative
Intel,And then monetize the crap out of them.,Negative
Intel,I wish I got arc raiders over BF6 lol,Neutral
Intel,Both games do not use any of the new tech out and both are not rendering anywhere close to what other games are. TIL this day Battlefield 5 and 1 look decades better than 6.  Battlefield6 also still have the high CPU Bug. This game is a downgrade in graphics and doesn’t use RT/PT nor Lumen so it’s nothing groundbreaking. Same goes for Arc.  If this was Battlefront 2 or something then yes. So saying these games are proof of good optimization is a stretch to be fair.,Negative
Intel,"Arc raiders I don't really agree with, I think there's a lot of room for improvement there. I thought the finals ran far better. Bf6 though absolutely",Negative
Intel,"It seems that UE5 is finally maturing. With the Witcher 4 development influencing the 5.6 version, recent developers benefit from the improved tooling and fixed issues.",Positive
Intel,Explain it to me slowly; why do people have a problem with using DLSS?  It's just a tool developers use to increase performance.  It doesn't change the gameplay and any latency it adds is only going to be noticeable in edge cases.   The developers don't owe it to you that the game runs with your preferred settings.,Negative
Intel,Don't forget Helldivers 2 used upscaling by default too. So people with great systems probably didn't even realize why it looked a bit smudgy unless they specifically went into the video options and turned off the upscaling.,Negative
Intel,"BF6 sure, arc raiders…. Eeeeeehhhhh",Neutral
Intel,"You do realize the only reason BF6 is ""optimized"" is because there's no ray tracing?   It's basically battlefield 4 with different color filters and way higher res textures.",Negative
Intel,"Battlefield 6 is a 70gb download and has an rtx *2060* as its minimum.  Y'all's standards are in the dirt. Though judging by your examples, they're also extremely inconsistent. Helldivers 2, for example, has lower requirements than either of those games.",Negative
Intel,"It's a good combination of technical implementation and good design. Their games aren't huge in scope: The Finals and Arc Raiders, for example, use very deliberate sizes for the maps and number of players. If you tried to put the destruction in The Finals, with a 64 player server, it would take some crazy work to get it to work as smoothly. Same thing with Arc Raiders: the game looks great, but it is also very carefully designed not to be too heavy from the beginning.",Positive
Intel,"Something very important to consider that people don't mention enough, is that it was made using a modded version of UE5 not base UE5.",Neutral
Intel,I was blown away arc raiders defaulted to high on my 1070ti (iric). It ran fine. I only played 1 night during server slam.   Bf6 beta ran fine but defaulted to low. I bumped textures and a couple things to medium and still seemed OK.,Positive
Intel,"Mhm, same. My poor 14400f keeps on dropping below 60 fps on some maps, despite my 9070xt chugging out 120+ frames constantly.   I know that I'm cpu bottlenecked as is, but it's just certian moments where it drops, at other times/on other maps it's constant 80-100 frames without issues.",Negative
Intel,What's the fix?,Neutral
Intel,"BF6's optmization also involves tiny render distance. Even having settings on Overkill and running it on an NVMe, things pop in like at 500m from you when flying.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah BF6 is decent, but has some issues. I've never had a game require so much tinkering to run correctly. I needed a BIOS update, a CFG file, and multiple other tweaks to get that game to run at its best. I also have to point out that the CPU optimisation needs some work outside of these tweaks, nothing BF6 does apart from the improved server-side physics should be reducing CPU performance by a large margin.",Negative
Intel,"You are 100% correct and PCMR is being PCMR as usual....Arc Raiders replaced Lumen for a MUCH less demanding and unimpressive version of GI. It has less light bouncing, it literally only Ray Traces light and no it's not as if it's difficult to replace it. It was a decision, nothing more.  Battlefield 6 I'm not even going to start there lolol...all I see is jaggy box buildings and terrible foliage. It's destruction model is o.k. at best but it does show on the CPU side of things. The actual rendering? I played games that looked better during covid.   I'm not going to knock the decisions as MP games shouldn't be intensive. But to act like the developers are more talented is a flat out lie...but I'll be downvoted too In the biggest mass hypocrisy ever..the OpTiMiZAtIOn crisis of 2025 where people who shouldn't be on p.c. are still running their COVID builds and trying to max out cutting edge games",Negative
Intel,"Agreed, I've been loving BF6 and while it looks good and runs well, it doesn't look *great* either. It hasn't wowed me graphically like other recent releases.   I'll be one of the few people wishing it had an RT option. The models and textures look pretty good but the lighting is its biggest weakness.",Positive

Intel,Bf6 isn’t the greatest looking game which is fine. But performance wise it is amazing,Positive
Intel,"I think people aren't against upscaling or frame gen. What people don't like is forcing it to get playable performance. For example, the 3060 can manage high settings on Indiana jones and get mostly 60fps at 1080p native. That's more than acceptable, but if I wanted to get MORE than 60fps I can CHOOSE to enable DLSS Quality for example, and if I'm getting 60+ fps all the time I can CHOOSE to enable some frame gen to get a smoother image. But games like Monster Hunter Wilds where by default the presets enable upscaling and frame gen only to get 60 fps, and that's frame gen FPS so in reality more like 30 fps or actual frames. That's the problem.  The technologies are great when it enhances the experience to a better level, not to achieve the bare minimum.",Neutral
Intel,"The upscaling paradigm has become necessary because rendering 4x the pixels over 1080p is very intensive, yet developers want to use the extra power to improve visuals for real, not just improve resolution. Games running at various resolutions was a normal thing during the CRT era, fixed pixel displays made upscaling necessary and consoles having been doing it since the HD era. It's unrealistic to expect every developer to make their games run at native 4k 60fps, especially when they want to improve visuals at the same time.",Neutral
Intel,"I think the default should be good performance at native res, enabling upscaling should be a bonus to performance, not what is required to get playable framerates with reasonable graphics settings.  I always boot a game up first at native first, see what the perf is, then if it's not great then i drop down to FSR 4 quality.  The ideal scenario is great performance while having FSR 4 set to native AA, such a crisp image",Neutral
Intel,"True, it‘s good tech. But let me tell you how many times I thought i saw an enemy in Battle Royale, which was in fact an upscaling artefact.",Neutral
Intel,Yup. Avatar is optimized. It's just demanding because it pushes a lot of technologies.,Neutral
Intel,Go ahead and find that acceptable that's what they like to hear. What you find acceptable just becomes the new bare minimum for them and then when that feels normal they drop the bar again.,Neutral

Intel,Do a bios update and thank me later.,Neutral
Intel,"You do make a fair point, though games like Helldivers 2 don't even have any of those, and suffer from being a poorly optimized game. Also, Arc Raiders do have RT or RTX Global Illumination. Battlefield 6 is an odd one, but I guess that's understandable, considering developers wanted most systems to be able to run the game well enough, and considering it's a multiplayer-focused game so everyone wants to have high frames.",Negative

Intel,"Battlefield 6 is not a 70GB download if you select specific DLCs/parts to be installed (Campaign/Multiplayer/Redsec and its HD textures, my download is 43.7GB with RedSec and Multiplayer only being installed).

Quality game devs will always work Dev magic.   You also have games like helldivers 2, looks dated, runs worse than every single well optimized ue5 game. I have 400 hours in that game but everytime I turn it on I cant imagine why it took so long for people to complain about performance. The game ran terribly since launch.

You usually need to make some sort of sacrifice just that hopefully that sacrifice is small enough that you won’t notice. With something like DLSS I certainly think you make a very tiny sacrifice, especially at higher internal resolution.

A lot of people aren't use to it but if I went to the Steam forums in 2016 complaining about game optimization in current games with a 460 I'd be laughed off the forums and if I came there expecting 120 fps in Metro on my 7950 I'd be told to get help...  GPU prices are high yea..I'll accept a Nvideas a monopoly post any day of the week...but to be toxic to developers because your old ass shit won't run their game is a level of low I don't care to be grouped up with.they are at a 12% profit margin and make the least, Steam makes more than them no matter how hard they try..you have one company sitting on 5 trillion dollars selling a 60 series GPU with 8 gb Vram for 300 bucks and it's the developers fault because your mind can only line up cause and effect with what's in your direct vision. If you were sitting on a 3060 ti this year you were suppose to upgrade..plain and simple.  Games are seeing almost the same average frames as they always have on flagship models. There was always games that ran better because that's what the developer chose...but bashing software pushing devs so one day mis ranged can run Nanite and Path Tracing isn't the answer..they are walking so Battlefield 6 can run.

For games multi-GPU is gone for good (too few users, too large cost of development, no return of investment for game Studios). But in simulation/HPC/AI software multi-GPU is very common as it allows to go beyond the VRAM capacity of a single large GPU for cheaper.",Neutral
Intel,"sli/crossfire were killed for good reason, its just a bad time all around if half of your gpu's core/cache is located a foot away from the other half, unless your baseline performance is so damn low that the microstutters just get lost in the noise.  ultimately chiplet cpu/gpu designs are basically just an evolved form of sli/crossfire, and we're happily starting to get quite good at those.

Intel,"indeed it did, if only game devs adopted this more. Then again, the idea of two high end GPUs like we have today in a single PC is kinda horrifying.",Negative

PC will perform the best if OS is located on the closest one.   Much better off just slapping two GPUs together in a single form factor than two separate GPUs.

Intel,"We know the Arc B580 runs well with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is 8 core/ 16 thread CPU.  According to these graphs, the i9-14900K (8P + 16E = 32 thread) and the i5-13600K (6P + 8E = 20 thread) CPUs do fine.  The extreme budget CPU i3-12100F (4P = 8 Thread) performs with a notable degrade in performance.  My current hypothesis is Intel's driver is relying on a heavier multithreading with a bit of crosstalking of the driver workload, potentially to take advantage of underused E cores, which the 13600K and 14900K have plenty.  Given the Ryzen 5 series CPUs have similar performance issues as the 12100K, having 6 cores and 12 threads, I would like to see Ryzen 7 non-X3D CPUs (8 core/ 16 thread), Core i5-14400 (6P + 4E = 16 Thread), and Core i5-12500 (6P + 0E = 12 Thread) CPUs compared as well.  Playing off Intel translating DX11 to DX12 drivers as an example, when DX11 game loads, Intel establishes 2 processes, the DX12 driver and the DX11 translator.  For optimal performance, all threads need to be running simultaneously, the DX11 translator sends command to the DX12 driver in real time.  If there isn't enough room for the threads to be running simultaneously, any data traded between the two have to wait until the next thread is switched in before getting a response.  More threading density means more delays.  Some games don't get impacted either because the game involves less threads or the driver doesn't need the real-time translation threads.",Neutral
Intel,"It's probably because the Intel gpu drivers weren't written that well since it was probably ported with little changes from their igpu drivers where there was always a GPU bottleneck which meant that Intel might not have known there was even an issue until more attention was bought to the issue with Battlemage.  Alchemist was a flop, not many people bought it so not much attention was paid to CPU overhead issues.  AMD/Nvidia by contrast have spent the last 20 years painstakingly writing and optimizing their DGPU drivers. Nvidia had some CPU overhead issues a few years ago and they managed to improve it with driver fixes.",Negative
Intel,One thing I appreciate about AMD is having the lowest CPU overhead for their graphics drivers. Makes a difference if you're CPU limited in a game.,Neutral

Intel,"According to the graphs, AMD has slightly less overhead than NVIDIA.",Neutral
Intel,"No, they do not.  The reason they have overhead can't be solved with software.  They've excluded hardware from their GPU's and required the CPU to do the work of that missing hardware.  The main example that seems to suggest otherwise is actually a demonstration of nVidia's forced threading of DX11 games, which can increase performance despite the increased overhead it entails, when the CPU has enough headroom overall (i.e. it doesn't eat into the single-thread performance).",Negative

I think this will be great for non-gaming purposes, like Adobe, Autodesk and so on. 890M should be a photo editing powerhouse.",Positive
Intel,"I mean current consoles are already APU power houses, they can give you 120fps depending on the game, and 30-60fps depending on what mode you select.

Maybe they'll improve it by hooking it up to a wider GDDR bus in laptops, similar to how the current PS5 and Xboxes work (IIRC?)",Neutral
Intel,The biggest uplift would be seen on lower power comparison.     Strix Point simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to feed all those GPU cores at high performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"This review is quite a bit different than the others.  The other paint a much more positive picture.  Also, so-dimm is much slower so expect worse performance.",Negative
Intel,"It depends on what your goals are for a laptop.  AMD added 4 CUs and 3% clockspeed increase but got only half the expected 36% uplift, so 2 CUs went to waste (memory bus bottlenecks)!   I would argue that the problem with laptops today is the horrible 100w+ chips from Intel, as Apple has proved with its wildly duccessful M1, M2, M3 chips.  If you agree with this, the Strix point chips use half the power of the AMD 884x chips and move alway from Intel Thighburner laptops, and this is the most important direction right now, as ALL recent Intel laptops have terrible energy efficiency ...",Negative
Intel,"likely memory bottlenecked severely and on-package memory will probably become standard for these types of chips thanks to Apple. the bandwidth benefits just can't be ignored anymore, especially with the slowdown and exponentially increased costs of node shrinks. Intel is already moving on it and I think the main thing holding AMD back is that they rely on 3rd parties for memory packaging so the capacity goes to the more lucrative enterprise chips first.",Neutral
Intel,"The iGPU uplift is extremely underwhelming, I guess this is why Asus did the ROG Ally X model instead of waiting for these chips. I wouldnt be surprised if Lunar Lake with Xe2 passes Zen 5's iGPU at lower power levels, at higher ones im sure RNDA 3.5 will be ahead.",Negative

Intel,"It'll need to be a custom tooled APU like Aerith/Van Gogh if it is to take full advantage of the 890m.     Nearly all of the configs that release of 16cu Point APU or 40cu Halo will be an APU slapped in a chassis without an adequate power or memory bandwidth setup for the igpu.     What we need is a Steam Deck with 6c12t of full zen5 and an 890m.  This chip should have custom power profiles set up, just like Aerith, so that the GPU takes a bigger share of the power budget and can actually perform at lower wattages.  The system should have an actual TRUE quadcore memory setup.  Many of these systems have currently (and will absolutely continue to have) dualchannel ram available to the igpu, and it cuts the bandwidth down which strangulates the igpu.     Each chip is on a 32-bit bus, so a dualchannel bus would come in at 64-bit, and with 7500mhz lpddr5x come out to ~60gb/s.  This matches my system that runs a 780m with 7500mhz lpddr5x.  In theory, a quadchannel setup would pump that to 128-bit and ~120gb/s.  This will continue to hamstring these APUs regardless of how many cu they throw at em.",Neutral
Intel,"“Absolute monster”? It is 1/4 the graphical power of M3 Max, and eats way more watts. We are talking about Steam Deck here, so you basically have the same catalog of games on SteamOS as you do on Mac/CrossOver.  If you want to go price to performance, the base M3 is the same performance for around the same prices (starting at $500 for Mac Mini and going up to $899 for MacBook Air, with SD OLED starting at $549 and going up to $649). (I am assuming if a new SD had a new chip, it would at minimum start at OLED prices.) With the SD you will get higher base storage and RAM (though in my testing on both systems, neither has been able to pull 8GB total system RAM use on AAA games, due to APU bottleneck.). On the Mac side you will have better build quality, higher resolution, more ports, better speakers and most importantly for mobile gaming you will have 6 hours plus of AAA gaming. Where as there were some AAA games that killed my deck in 1 hour, with most dying around the 2 hour mark.    AMD has a long way to go before claiming “Monster” class APUs. 890M gets absolutely destroyed by the fanless ultra thin tablet mobile APU in the iPad. AMDs desktop APUs with full fat coolers and pulling watts from a wall outlet aren’t even close to being in the running with a tablet, let alone M3 Pro.. Let alone M3 Max… let alone M2 Ultra. Its desktop tower chip is behind the entry level mobile OS chip from its competitor. It is a decade behind the desktop chips of its competitor, itis hardly Monster class.",Neutral

And AMD ""can make"" such APUs -> PS5 Pro (as a more cost effective solution). AMD isn't like Apple who can make up the expense of creating a mega sized APU by selling a finished product/selling services etc.",Neutral
Intel,"APU is one of AMD’s biggest markets. You are kidding if you think they don’t need to compete there. They are way behind the race with Nvidia in desktop cards so that is irrelevant, unless your point was to say that they don’t need to compete anywhere and they should always be in second place.     AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant. The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra. It sucks way too many watts for that level of performance (which also accounts for cost). Not to mention games aren’t the only thing APUs are used for so PS5 isn’t wholey in the conversation. PS5 also costs monthly to play online and their games aren’t more expensive than PC so the whole cost savings thing is thrown out the window when you consider the real money being spent. Apple is a hardware first company and thats where the bulk of their profits come from, not services. Especially on Mac where there are little services at all people would even use there that have a subscription or software for sale.   If services were the reason, then for sure you would be able to buy a Surface Laptop powered by an AMD APU that puts MacBooks to shame, considering all your data Microsoft is selling, along with Office sub sales, and all the ads and preinstalled third party software. But instead Surface laptops are priced around the same as MacBooks and they have less powerful APUs and the AMD version suck up battery life.",Negative
Intel,"Not a single point of yours make sense.   ""APU is one of AMD's biggest markets"" - No. The major APU customer of AMD is Sony and Microsoft for their consoles. Not the general public as it's going to very expensive to sell PS5 type APU in the open market. 8700G costs 330 usd which is crazy.  ""The PS5 Pro sucks. It performs worse than M2 Max and M2 Ultra."" - Interesting, you already have comparisons between an unreleased console and an Apple laptop/desktop. Oh and how much does the cheapest M2 Max and M2 Ultra machine cost?   ""AMD cannot make such APUs. Their GPU cores suck 1 to 1 core to core compared to Apple’s, so the size comparison is irrelevant."". No idea what benchmark you are referring, what metric you are comparing.   However I can provide some idea on CPU cores and die size as cross platform benchmarks are available.  Cinebench R24 Multicore:  2x71 mm2 16 core 7950X: 2142 pts   2x70.6 mm2 16 core 9950X: 3000 pts  1000mm2 M2 Ultra: 1918 pts  So yea, Apple's solution is simply throwing more money at the problem.

Intel,"Nope it was set up correctly and verified by Intel insiders discord ARC engineer team also verified it was set up by multiple people Intel acknowledge the VRR was not working as intended but had no solution and all drivers cleaned in safe mode with DDU.  VSYNC with VRR, both on and off, also verified to be working via windows confirmation, connected to Display Port because ARC does NOT support VRR over HDMI 2.0 and needs minimum HDMI 2.1  I am also a experienced PC Technician for over 2 decades.  The 6800 XT just works, right out of the box rock solid functionality, period!  I just happened to have a monitor capable of reporting extra statistics and I have knowledge of using Frog Pursuit from aperture grill to test both backlight strobing cross talk and VRR functionality for each individual monitor and GPU my monitor is also a Blur Buster 2.0 certified monitor  after realizing it was an issue with ARC I ordered the 6800 XT, removed ARC and ran DDU in safe mode.  Slapped in RX 6800 XT, installed newest driver and VIOLA, works beautifully first attempt with zero configuration whatsoever. Forget about the raw power we know the 6800 XT is obviously in a class far above anything Intel is currently offering so is it's price. It's just unfortunate the ARC fails to match even a 6600 XT in UE5 games but it's gonna be fixed with battlemage rest assured.   The ARC architecture just isn't there for UE5, drivers won't fix that performance issue, AMD just happens to do extremely well with UE5 because their architecture is more mature.  The bottom line the AMD drivers are obviously and understandably light years ahead of Arc drivers.  Nothing wrong with that ARC is a beta product that's why Intel doesn't build a 4090 or 7900 XTX competitor because drivers are their current issue not hardware.  Again there is NOTHING wrong with ARC having these issues it is a beta card, Intel specifically warned AGAINST buying it if you need a reliable card, I bought it to help intel and test it our of curiosity, I wasn't really prepared for that much issues but it's fine it has a happy new owner who isn't even using if for gaming he is using it for AV1 encoding.  I am just glad I could help out with the sale for a 3rd party vendor in the race here and am even happier I got rid of it and it has a new owner who isn't using it for gaming  It was an impossible sell for gaming nobody wanted it for gaming sadly but it worked out for me in the end",Neutral
Intel,What Ghost of Tsushima issue?,Neutral
Intel,"That was back in the 90's... While it would technically be their first, absolutely nothing from that dGPU wouldve carried over to Arc, its so old that its irrelevant to talk about.  You could also say DG1 from 2020 could be their 'first' dGPU since it was their first modern dGPU oriented at consumers, albeit it was clearly just an ultra low volume test platform to figure some stuff out prior to the Arc launch.  Most people would consider Alchemist (Arc gen1) as Intel's first dGPU, even though it technically isnt, it's still the most relevant one.",Neutral

Intel,"Arc is not beta, neither the hardware, firmware or sofware. Intel does not refer to it as beta, why should the consumers do so?

Intel,"Bit of a rant, but I have an AMD 6700XT and do a wide variety of things with my computer. It feels like every way I look AMD is just completely behind in the drivers department..  * Compute tasks under Windows is basically a no-go, with HIP often being several times slower than CUDA in the same workloads and most apps lacking HIP support to begin with. Blender Renders are much slower than much cheaper nvidia cards and this holds true across many other programs. DirectML is a thing too but it's just kinda bad and even with libraries as popular as PyTorch it only has some [half baked dev version from years ago](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/issues/545) with many github issues complaining. I can't use any fun AI voice changers or image generators at all without running on CPU which makes them basically useless. [ZLuda](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) is a thing in alpha stage to convert CUDA calls to HIP which looks extremely promising, but it's still in very alpha stage and doesn't work for a lot of things. * No support for HIP/ROCm/whatever passthrough in WSL2 makes it so I can't even bypass the issue above. NVIDIA has full support for CUDA everywhere and it generally just works. I can run CUDA apps in a docker container and just pass it with --gpus all, I can run WSL2 w/ CUDA, I can run paravirtualized GPU hyper-v VMs with no issues. * I'm aware this isn't supported by NVIDIA, but you can totally enable vGPUs on consumer nvidia cards with a hacked kernel module under Linux. This makes them very powerful for Linux host / Windows passthrough GPU gaming or a multitude of other tasks. No such thing can be done on AMD because it's limited at a hardware level, missing the functionality. * AMD's AI game upscaling tech always seems to just continuously be playing catch-up with NVIDIA. I don't have specific examples to back this up because I stopped caring enough to look but it feels like AMD is just doing it as a ""We have this too guys look!!!"". This also holds true with their background noise suppression tech. * Speaking of tech demos, features like ""AMD Link"" that were supposed to be awesome and revolutionize gaming in some way just stay tech demos. It's like AMD marks the project as maintenance mode internally once it's released and just never gets around to actually finishing it or fixing obvious bugs. 50mbps as ""High quality""? Seriously?? Has anyone at AMD actually tried using this for VR gaming outside of the SteamVR web browser overlay? Virtual Desktop is pushing 500mbps now. If you've installed the AMD Link VR (or is it ReLive for VR? Remote Play? inconsistent naming everywhere) app on Quest you know what I'm talking about. At least they're actually giving up on that officially as of recently. * AMD's shader compiler is the cause of [a lot of stuttering](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12wizig/the_shader_cache_stutter_on_amd_is_way_more/) in games. It has been an issue for years. I'm now using Amernime Zone repacked drivers which disable / tweak quite a few features related to this and my frametime consistency has improved dramatically in VR, and so did it for several other people I had try them too. No such issues on NVIDIA. The community around re-packing and modding your drivers should not even have to exist. * The auto overclock / undervolt thing in AMD's software is basically useless, often failing entirely or giving marginal differences from stock that aren't even close to what the card is capable of. * Official AMD drivers can render your PC completely unusable, not even being able to safe mode boot. I don't even know how this one is possible and I spent about 5 hours trying to repair my windows install with many different commands, going as far as to mount the image in recovery environment, strip out all graphics drivers and copy them over from a fresh .wim but even that didn't work and I realized it would be quicker to just nuke my windows install and start over. Several others I know have run into similar issues using the latest official AMD drivers, no version in particular (been an issue for years). AMD is the reason why I have to tell people to DDU uninstall drivers, I have never had such issues on NVIDIA. * The video encoder is noticeably worse in quality and suffers from weird latency issues. Every other company has this figured out. This is a large issue for VR gaming, ask anyone in the VR communities and you won't get any real recommendations for AMD despite them having more VRAM which is a clear advantage for VR and a better cost/perf ratio. Many VRchat worlds even have a dedicated checkbox in place to work around AMD-specific driver issues that have plagued them for years. The latency readouts are also not accurate at all in Virtual Desktop, there's noticeable delay that comes and goes after switching between desktop view and VR view where it has to re-start encoding streams with zero change in reported numbers. There are also still issues related to color space mapping being off and blacks/greys not coming through with the same amount of depth as NVIDIA unless I check a box to switch the color range. Just yesterday I was hanging out watching youtube videos in VR with friends and the video player just turned green with compression artifacts everywhere regardless of what video was playing and I had to reboot my PC to fix it. * There are *still* people suffering from the high idle power draw bugs these cards have had for years, me included. As I type this my 6700XT is currently drawing 35 watts just to render the windows desktop, discord and a web browser. How is it not possible to just reach out to some of the people experiencing these issues and diagnose what's keeping the GPU at such a high power state??  If these were recent issues / caused by other software vendors I'd be more forgiving, I used to daily drive Linux and I'm totally cool with dealing with paper cuts / empty promises every now and then. These have all been issues as far back as I can find (many years) and there's been essentially no communication from AMD on any of them and a lack of any action or *even acknowledgement of the issues existing*. If my time was worth minimum wage, I've easily wasted enough of it to pay for a much higher tier NVIDIA GPU. Right now it just feels like I've bought the store brand equivalent.",Negative

Also, what do you think is the core fix here? Is it hardware design, in the firmware, drivers, combination of everything? If it was an easy fix, you'd think AMD would have fixed it.  When Hotz got on Twitter for a particular issue, AMD seemed to jump on it and provide a fix.  But for these larger issues they don't.  Could there be a level here where the issue is really the vendors design and how they implement AMD's hardware?   Some of the most powerful super computers use Instinct.  Seems hard to believe that they would just put up with these issues and go back to AMD for their next upgrade, which Oak Ridge has done.

Intel,"I've got a 7900XTX for a year now, and I've not had any stability or performance issues with it, so far at least.  What does bothers me though, is that 1 year later I still cannot connect my 3 monitors to the card without it sucking 100watts at idle, and recent drivers don't even mention that as an issue anymore, so it's not even being recognized as a problem by AMD.  This happens even if my monitors are turned off, I literally have to go under my desk and pull out the cable to resolve this, obviously rendering my extra monitor useless.   So now I'm looking to upgrade my cpu (5800x) to one with an integrated GPU so I can connect my secondary monitors to the iGPU so my system doesn't constantly suck an obscene amount of power doing absolutely nothing.

We still have CPU scheduler issues, we still have NUMA issues when dealing with latency sensitive PCIE deployments, the famous reset bug in your OP, lack of Vendor relationships and unification across the platform (IE, Epyc, Radeon/Instinct, AMD Advantage+, ...etc).   In the years since Zen shipped, it took an act of god to get them to move. Maybe Lisa remembers those meetings we pulled with Dell, HP, and VMware back then. Where the cloud providers that adopted Epyc 7001 early were all very pissed off at the over all performance because of the failure of AMD to work with the OEMs to correctly adopt how NUMA changed. Because they did not get any guidance from AMD engineering on the matter until after these SI's were mid/full deployment.   So yes, I doubt AMD is going to take your OP any more serious then they took the NUMA issues until it starts to affect their bottom line.

It is a massive PITA and most of the time I end up giving up and moving on. The most recent time it involved using an AI tool to restore a photo. After hours of screwing around on Windows and Linux I ended up just having a friend with a 3080 do it for me. He had it working in 10 minutes.   And when stuff (outside of gaming) does work, it’s usually a day late and a dollar short. Blender on Linux still can’t do hardware RT in Cycles (it can on Linux), and general HIP support tool far too long.   The argument can be made that there’s no need to worry about this if you only game, but unless price is an issue, you may be locking yourself out from testing a cool piece of software later.

Also not all issues are always caused by AMD but that does not give AMD the right to ignore it, especially considering their plenty of problems usually, it just means AMD is lacking in the compatibility departement and the whole anti-lag+ debacle says enough about that, alto i really liked that feature i would rather blame cheaters, cos without cheaters you would not need anti cheat, and this would be less of a problem, still says more about fact that their probably should be something like api support for features such as anti-lag+ but also AMD enhanced sync or NVIDIA features.

Intel,"Business opportunity for EEs now: Time to make some custom PCIe adapter boards with a bunch of analog switches for cycling all power and signal lines on the PCIe slot, then sell them for use in corporate AMD GPU deployments. Sure, toggling PCIe signal is expensive, as it's basically a radio signal at ~10 GHz. Toggling the 12 V power input is also expensive due to the high current. But both are ""just"" expensive but doable. The cost, at worst, is an expensive relay for power, and additional PCIe redrivers or switches for signals. ""It's one PCB, What could it cost, $100?"" If corporate users have already paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on AMD GPUs, and now someone's offering a solution to actually make them usable at a fraction of the original hardware cost, it must be selling great.  On second thought, the hardware must be certified and pass PCIe compliance tests and electrical safety tests before they're acceptable for big corporate users. Even then, most are not in a position to do any hardware modification (including adding additional hardware). So the ""proper"" way of doing so would be first contacting a big corporate user first, ask them to request this feature from server vendors like Super Micro. Then you need to pass this design to them, and they pass this design to Super Micro, and it will only appear in a next-gen server... This makes this workaround largely impractical.

Except it can't.  Constant thousands of posts regarding crashes, hangouts, reboots, tweaks, registry edits, hotspots over 100ºc, incompatibilities with the OS, everything is to blame on the system except the AMD GPU. Chipset drivers that can't clean old drivers on install and create registry entries mess, GPU drivers that, will mostly work if you always do clean install, but with a software bundle that causes too much conflicts with the driver itself etc etc  I know Microsoft is complicated, but we're not talking windows millennium here, and if other brands manage to have drivers/programs that actually work with the OS, why can't AMD, and why do the warriors for AMD blame the OS, the PSU, the user, everything except AMD, when it is their favourite brand to blame?

The other card had more than 8gb and wasn't.    Point being: How accurate are the vram usage numbers? No way in hell was 0.8 gb vram going unused in the nvidia card, as the pool was clearly saturated, so how accurate are these totals?    There is zero (afaik) documentation of the schemes either manufacturer uses to partition vram; what is actually in use & what on top of that is marked as 'this might come in handy later on'.    So what do the two brands report?

This is why they do not need to care, right now.  But if AMD adopted a fully supported and WORKING VDI vGPU solution they could take the spot light from NVIDIA due to cost alone. Currently their MxGPU solution is only fully supported by VMware, it ""can"" work on Redhat but you run into this amazing reset bug and flaky driver support, and just forget Debian powered solutions like Proxmox which is taking the market with Nutanix away from VMware because of Broadcom's ""Brilliance"".

Intel,"I am not fixing anything, this is an incorrect assumption.  I have a setup that is exhibiting these faults, the faults are affecting me and my clients, and as such I am in the ideal position to report the debugging details to AMD in a way that is most useful to the AMD developers to resolve the problem. And because I already have systems experiencing these problems, I am very able to quickly test and report back to AMD on if any fixes they implemented were successful or not.  Do I think AMD should have more rigorous testing so these things get addressed before release? Yes, sure, 100%, but there will always be missed edge cases that are unexpected and not tested for.  A prime example is another issue I have with the AMD drivers that is really not their fault, and they could chose to just say that it's unsupported.  Recently I discovered that it was possible to use a DirectX 12 API to create a texture resource in memory that the user allocated ([https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device3-openexistingheapfromaddress) \+ [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-createplacedresource)), and have the GPU copy into that directly. This API is documented by Microsoft as a diagnostic API, it was never intended to be used in this manner, however it works on NVidia, and mostly works on AMD, improving the performance of Looking Glass by a factor of 2x or more.  Not only is this using a ""diagnostic"" API, we are mapping memory that was mapped into userspace from a virtual PCI device, which is memory that has been mapped on the host system, which then finally maps to physical RAM. To my knowledge there is absolutely no other use case that this would ever be useful for.  I can almost guarantee you that there is no way the developers would have thought to write a test case for this, it is not just off the path a little bit, but instead down a cave, in the dark without a torch, being lead by a deaf mute with only one leg while being chased by a pack of rabid wolves.  The issue here isn't about helping AMD fix their drivers or not, it's about being able to help them in the first place.

All I see is graphs comparing it to OpenCL, and this sad state of affairs..  https://i.redd.it/mdcvx487vcsc1.gif  From the project's FAQ page.. only further reinforces my point.

After some  deliberation, Intel  decided that there is no business case for running  CUDA applications on  Intel GPUs.Shortly thereafter I got in contact with AMD and in early   2022 I have left Intel and signed a ZLUDA development contract with AMD.

Only the old old old S7150 ever got an outdated open-source repo for Linux KVM support and that's it. This means the documentation and community support are pretty much non-existent, you REALLY are on your own with MxGPU.  Nvidia Grid(meditated vGPU), despite having a notorious reputation on licensing, just works and can be hacked onto consumer cards.

If I bought a car and everytime I drive it the heater jumps on and starts to cook me, and a year later the manufacturer still hasn't resolved it I'm not gonna buy a car from the same brand.   As for possible solutions; at this point I've sunken far too many hours into it to warrant further attempts, I've tried a plethora of drivers, ran DDU multiple times, fiddled with the settings (such as freesync), setup custom resolutions with varying refresh rates etc... If my only issue with AMD was occasionally reverting a driver I wouldn't be complaining, I had to do that with my previous Nvidia card as well, but this is unacceptable tbh.   Anyway, so far nothing has worked, the only time I've seen normal idle power is if all my monitors are turned off (not standby after you press their button, but physically turned off using the powerstrip they're plugged into). If I then remote into the system it's normal, not exactly practical though.  And overall it's not a major issue if it didn't negate the one advantage this card had over the 4090, namely it's value. Some rough napkin math tells me this thing could cost me close to 100 euro's per year extra just in idle power draw, over the course of several years this means a 4090 would've been cheaper despite its absurd price.  As a final note to this, if AMD came out and said they can't fix this issue due to the design of the board or w/e, I could honestly respect that, at least then I know I shouldn't keep on waiting and hoping but I can start looking for a workaround. Instead a couple patches ago they ""improved high idle power with multiple displays for the 7xxx series"" (which did the opposite for me and added a couple watts even) and ever since they don't even mention it anymore, I don't even know if they're still trying to fix it or gave up entirely.

Intel,"VRAM usage is specific.

So it may be DX feature. It very common/easy to see it in VRChat large maps, or large Unity games.  In Linux - *in some cases, but it very common* - you get more VRAM usage on Nvidia compare to AMD because this how Vulkan driver implemented in Nvidia and overhead of DXVK.  P.S. For context - Unity VRAM usage is - Unity allocating ""how much it want"" and in case of two different GPU Unity may allocate less or more in DX-API, or DX-API have some internal behavior for Unity case on Nvidia so it allocating less.

Saying that these ""features"" are useless is like saying AVX512, AVX2, etc are useless for CPUs.   RT performance can take up to 8x same GPU surface on raster cores, or 1x surface on dedicated hardware.   Upscaling using AI can take up to 4x dedicated space on GPU pipeline or 1x on tensor cores.   The list goes on and on with a lot of features like tessellation, advanced mesh rendering, etc.   GPUs cant keep increasing transistor count and performance by raw brute forcing it, unless you want to pay twice for the GPU because the graphics core will take twice as much space.   Upscaling by AI, frame gen, dedicated hardware to complete the tasks the general GPU cores have issues with, etc are the future, and like it or not, they are here to stay.   Consoles had dedicated scaling hardware for years.   No one complained about that. It works.   And as long as it works and looks good, unless you NEED the latency for compwtitive gaming, its all a mind fap, without real world effects.

Intel,Darktide looks&runs way better with FSR2 than native 1080p for me. I don't know how they do it but there is no amount of AA that makes native resolution look better.,Positive
Intel,"Use Radeon Image Sharpening at 50% in the game's Radeon Settings profile when running native. FSR2 has its own sharpening pass. Many TAA implementations are blurry as fuck, which gives the illusion of better image quality when upscaling.",Negative
Intel,Okay fair enough! To me any upscaling has always looked worse than native in the games I've played and I've left it off.  Though it has undoubtedly gotten better recently - to my eyes it's never looked **better** than native resolution.,Negative
Intel,"I've used both FSR (2160p desktop) and DLSS (1080p laptop) and the loss in quality is noticeable to me. Always a softer image with less detail - yes, even DLSS. Performance always has a cost. Temporal upscaling is no different. DLAA and FSRAA actually are better than native, since they replace terrible TAA implementations and render at native.  However, this better than native upscaling narrative seems more like a belief (or a marketing push/tactic) than reality.   - If action is high enough, it probably won't matter much, but in single-player games where I like to look around, I just can't deal with the resolution loss. I'd rather turn RT off, as I did in Control (for AMD and Nvidia HW), which actually has decent RT effects.",Negative

Intel,> Enthusiast   > 1440p [...] with FSR Quality [...] 60 FPS  1440p + xxxx Quality upscaling is just another way to say 1080p you cowards. It's 2023 and enthusiast level is 1080p @ 60 FPS.   Looks pretty though with the amount of vegetation.  I'm surprised that they put the RTX 3080 and RX 6800 XT side by side in a game that has forced ray tracing. I guess that's the advantage of being cross platform and AMD sponsored.,Neutral

Intel,60fps with balanced upscaling on a 4080/7900xtx … That’s not a good sign,Negative
Intel,It's joever. We are officially at the point where devs are using upscaling as the standard to reach playable frame rates instead of optimizing their games.,Neutral
Intel,"If you look in the top right, these seem to be based on ray tracing being enabled? If that is the case, these specs actually seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"FSR and DLSS were supposed to be optional, now they seem to be mandatory in any graphics setup.",Neutral

Intel,"Really disliking this trend of all new games having ""with FSR/DLSS"" in their PC requirements tables. The requirements should all be done without any upscaling or frame generation tech to be upfront and honest about how the game will run. Upscaling will then just be an available option for users to further increase performance.",Negative
Intel,"Actually not to bad for current standards, 1440p 60 with fsr quality on a 6800xt/3080 is great if high includes RT, if it doesn't then it sucks",Negative
Intel,"So with my 6800xt, which should be able to do 1440p high settings at over 60fps easily, I'll have to use FSR just to get 60fps? Great, another unoptimized game headed our way.  So sick of the awful PC ports and such. 6800xt is still a very powerful card yet I'm seeing more and more games require it for 1440p 60fps high or even 1080p 60 fps high. Ridiculous.  The reliance on upscaling tech instead of properly optimizing the game is becoming a problem. And it seems this game has forced RT which is idiotic. RT destroys performance and should always be an option.",Negative
Intel,"If you notice, all the mentioned AMD GPUs are significantly better than Nvidia GPUs, so does that mean bad performance for AMD GPUs?",Neutral
Intel,So i bought an 1200€ card (rx 7900xtx in my region and at the time of launch) and can now enjoy new games at 60 fps with BALANCED fsr upscaling. We love to see it. /s,Positive
Intel,so I'm doomed to use FSR even at 1080p ? what a shame pc gaming has become.,Negative
Intel,"I honestly don't get this upscaling outrage. It's not a fixed requirement. If you want to play native, just turn off upscaling but you will have to turn down settings to compensate. Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. People want super low requirements, super high graphics with high FPS.  The thing is game devs/publishers want to highlight all the ""eye candy"" in games to show their advancement and that's how they want to advertise it. They have a certain level of visuals they want to present for the game. So they crank up the baseline and focus on making it look as good as they possibly can and by using upscalers to get to the playable FPS.  Other option is they ditch making games look any better and just keep it restrained to good FPS at native. But then you'll have the other subset of complainers that will complain about the game's graphics looking like X many years ago.  Take Alan Wake 2 for example, The medium setting looks better that some High-Ultra setting games from a few years ago. Running a AAA title 2-3 years ago at 'medium' preset may not equate to running a current AAA title at medium preset.  The games are getting too demanding because they are starting to push the limits visually (partially because on AAA titles, that's something they really focus on for advertising), if your card can run it, great, if not, adjust your settings to match your cards capabilities. If you bought a 6700XT 2+ years ago to play native 1440P on high setting, guess what, it's not always going to play 1440P at high settings as the years go by. You have to adjust your expectations of the card's capabilities as time goes on. Medium preset now is likely better than High preset then. If you want the ""same"" performance you used to get, match the visuals and see how it does.  Seems like the only way to get people to stop complaining is to just halt all visual/graphical progress and stick to limiting the game's visuals so they run well on mid/low tier cards.  People keep throwing out ""OPTIMIZATION"" but on one knows what/how they want that done. WHAT exactly do you want optimized? How do we know the game isn't optimized to the graphics/performance it gives?  What if they just made the ""High Quality"" preset look like games from 2018, would that now be considered ""Optimized""?  (I'm not talking about this game in particular, just in general, it was same outrage w/ AW2 and that turned out better than expected)",Neutral
Intel,I hope they will bundle this game with CPUs/GPUs,Neutral
Intel,holy hell so for 1080p you need a 1440p card because not even a RX 7600 is on par with a 3060ti or a 6700XT,Negative

Intel,"Another garbage with forced upscaling at baseline. When upscaling winded up - everyone was ""Hell yeah, high refresh rate AAA gaming""  Fast forward to today: ""FSR performance just to hit 1080p 60fps - yay..""   I fucking knew it.. it was so obvious upscaling will turn into this and replace game optimizations. Why optimizing shit, when you can tell people to turn on fucking FSR / DLSS / XeSS performance??   What a fucking shitshow... And few weeks back when I said I'm not gonna buy AMD GPU again because upscaling is getting mandatory and DLSS is just objectively superior - I was laughed in the face. Every major AAA game onwards will be shoving up upscaling as base line performance - so your typical 60fps marks (and 30fps - yes apparently that is still a thing on PC in 2023). There's no escape from this.",Negative

With this being a based on a movie game, I don’t have super high hopes that that’ll be the case though. Going from movie to game and vice versa almost always has bad results.   Also, displaying system requirements with upscaling is a bad joke. This is basically saying you’re not getting native 1080p 60fps without a 6800xt or 3080. Upscaling is definitely becoming the crutch a lot of folks feared it would be.",Negative

Intel,and a year ago i kept saying this here and i got downvoted to hell   its so obvious that the game engine devs and game companies pressured both nvidia and amd for this because they can release games faster and somewhat unoptimised,Negative
Intel,"Upscaling, once a promising and beneficial tech, now abused by almost every dev cause they are lazy to optimize. :(",Negative
Intel,Nope we as a community abused a nice thing,Positive
Intel,"Alan Wake 2 (and others) is proof that this doesn't matter any more. DLSS Quality looks and runs better than DLAA native rendering as shown a number of times and documented by tech power up and actually observed by those of us playing it  It's about time people stop crying the ""omg no native rendering"" beat as this is a mentality that is irrelevant in 2023. It's pretty clear that too many games come with performance issues and as such ""native"" rendering has the worst performance in those titles. At least upscaling offers a means to get better performance and in the vast majority of titles, better image quality as a result too with intricate details rendered at a higher fidelity thanks to image reconstruction. The likes of Digital Foundry showcase those benefits often in their videos. Plus the fact that all of the consoles upscale yet nobody bats an eyelid, yet for some reason a small portion of PC gamers seem to demand it no matter what, and then complain when it doesn't run as well as they had hoped in various titles.  It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's \[upscaling\] progression and the key driving factor as to why we can path trace and use other modern engine tech with such good performance and visual quality. This is probably the wrong sub to say such things, but this is the truth, and I fully expect pitchforks to be mounted.... But don't take it out on me, point the finger at AMD and ask them why they are falling so far behind.  At the end of the day if it looks good and runs good then nobody needs to bat an eyelid on whether it's got native or upscaled rendering. Everyone benefits as a result. Fact is the vast majority of modern games look and run better when using DLSS with only a handful of FSR exceptions (Callisto Protocol, for example).  Personally I want improved image detail, sharpness and performance, not just AA that DLAA brings to the table since it's just a more modern AA method vs ancient TAA/MSAA/FXAA etc. I don't care if there's no native option, I can just run with DLDSR if I want to render at a higher res and then apply an upscaler to that output to get the best of both worlds.",Neutral
Intel,Didn't take them long to make upscaling worthless.,Negative
Intel,i smell a burgeoning cottage industry of game spec reviewers!,Neutral
Intel,"I've hated upscaling since the beginning.   Now, it's being proven right in our faces that companies are no longer making 100% they're making 45% done games, and then they rely on upscaling and fake frames to do the rest.   Why have a fully optimized game that runs well natively when you can just lower the resolution by 3x then have frame generation help?   Full force ahead to frame generation= Every game will be optimized so badly that you're forced to upscale",Negative
Intel,"It’s literally right there in the hardware specs. 1080p fsr2 quality is 720p input resolution, so at native the game runs at 720p low on a 1070 or 5700.  It is the inverse of what reviewers have been doing with their benchmarks - if you are a fan who really has a stick up their ass about native res, just do the math yourself. They’ve given you all the pieces you need to calculate it out yourself, but that’s not how the game is supposed to be run so they aren’t going to put native res in the official marketing material.  Games are optimized around upscaling now and it is unhelpful and misleading to pretend otherwise. Rendering 4x as many pixels is *obviously* going to throw things off with more intensive effects, and lead to a generally unplayable experience.",Neutral
Intel,"Judging by how games work on 4090/7900 xtx, these cards turn from 4k 60 fps to 1080p 60 fps",Neutral
Intel,requirements have been a joke for over 20 years at this point i dont know why people are surprised.   on the other hand crappy devs using fancy upscaling and fake frames to get the game playable instead of just making a well made game is infuriating,Negative
Intel,yeah this is the new standard,Neutral
Intel,"RT is the future. With this game and Alan Wake 2 using software RT at all times and hardware RT for anything beyond ""low"", RT is the future.  At some point GPUs will be so powerful and game engines will have RT in the bag that RT will be used in basically all indie games...and then suddenly nobody will talk about RT anymore because RT is in everything for years.",Positive
Intel,and with fsr now standard on consoles it(or a similar tech) will be standard on pc :(,Neutral
Intel,"people also forget both AMD and nvidia didn't really offer a generation leap in GPU performance this gen, sure it's popular to call games ""unoptimized"" (I know many AAA releases are, not denying that) but the issue compounds with the fact that game devs couldn't predict a GPU generation to be this bad caused by inflated crypro-boom margins a generation prior",Negative
Intel,"As with almost every game release recently, expect the game to perform a bit better than the requirements.    Sometimes the hardware can achieve 60 FPS most of the time but drops below that in other times, so the devs just say it's guaranteed 30 FPS and call it a day. If you look at the 5700 vs 6700XT, the gap is almost 50% in most titles, this means that if the numbers for the 5700 were accurate then the 6700XT will be getting around 45 FPS at 1080p low (unless the game utilizes special hardware only available on the 6700XT) but the game targets 60 FPS at 1080p high on the 6700XT which leads me to believe the 5700 is gonna perform much better which should leave room for turning off upscaling.",Positive
Intel,"It does state ray tracing in the top right, we don't know if that's included in the requirements or not. I would definitely reserve judgment until we find out.",Neutral
Intel,Don't forget about Frame Gen too. IMO that's the worst part because that means it's 30 fps without it. Imagine the input latency...,Negative
Intel,The actual true crime here is even having fsr to begin with. It should just have dlss,Negative
Intel,Seems like they tried to cover every basis with these.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah it's kinda weird, even games that had a massive difference of performance when using dual channel RAM never listed it on their requirements :/",Negative
Intel,"I've noticed that many developers do this, for some reason developers seem to have some kind of secret passion for the 1070 lol",Neutral
Intel,It's because the minimum settings is with software RT enabled and thus they're using the fastest cards without hardware RT that can reach 1080p30 FSR2.,Neutral
Intel,"GCN support is over, RDNA1 is the lowest currently supported arch.",Neutral
Intel,"In 2023, RX 5700 performs equally or better than the RTX 2060 Super/2070. The 5600XT is more like a 2060 competitor.   Either the game runs like shit on AMD hardware, or the system requirements are wrong and they just write down the components that they tested with.   Another thing is that the game is doing is software based RT by default and that might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.",Negative
Intel,"They're not, those are the cheapest/slowest GPUs that have 8 GB of VRAM. Clearly game devs are done pandering to people who bought Nvidia's e-waste.",Negative
Intel,What do you mean forced raytracing?,Neutral
Intel,1440 + upscaling looks better than 1080p because you're on a 1440 resolution monitor.   Do you even 1440p?,Positive
Intel,"Honestly RT has a lot of fluff and the majority of which is the most costly for the least amount of noticeable fidelity increase. Try path tracing in Cyberpunk with reduced rays & bounces and you'll still get great soft lighting and GI without most of the performance hit when full tilt. If games only leverage certain aspects of RT then the performance is still comparable, that's also why the 3080 and 6800XT perform similarly in Fortnite with full RT/nanite/lumen settings.",Neutral

Intel,"I agree with this, that’s not that outrageous if this does include RT. Non RT would be pretty bad to need fsr but that is the quality mode.",Neutral
Intel,This is going to be the exact same situation as with Alan Wake. The game is going to come out and the requirements are going to make sense. People just aren't used to seeing games with mandatory rt.,Neutral
Intel,I would say pressured bc they announced it over a year ago and promised we will get it in september. Thats the problem with games an tech they all make promises and then cant keep the deadline. Just make smth new and when it works then announce it and make the last fine adjustments. If you make promises to early you set yourself up for failure.,Negative
Intel,"Maybe on the lower end, but for enthusiast and ultra... no, they're not ""significantly"" better. These are pretty on-par comparisons (outside of RT).",Negative

So there's that 😉",Neutral
Intel,Timed epic exclusivity? Aww man.,Neutral
Intel,Was guaranteed to happen when up scaling was announced... It's an excuse for less optimisation or to push fidelity more.  I saw a video of this avatar game it got an insane amount of plants visible at all times.,Negative
Intel,You... are.. joking... right..?,Neutral
Intel,Because it’s not coming to steam. It’ll be an epic games exclusive so everyone will pass on it until it hits steam in 18 months. At which point no one will buy an 18 month old game for full price and will wait for a 50% off sale at the minimum.,Neutral

Intel,Yea I know nothing about optimizations and if it could or couldn't fix this or that. I just want them to tell me exactly what I need to run the game at X resolution a Y preset with 60 fps. If that calls for a 14900k and a 4090 then just say so.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, I think we're really beginning to see a trend here with abusing upscaling for free mileage.  Not that upscaling isn't great but...  Apart from RT, on medium settings, I can't really see    massive improvements on visual quality that would warrant such a massive increase on requirements.  UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  We'll probably see this continuing to be a trend for a while, and then as tech novelty wears out, some devs will come out with more optimized and scalable titles.  With hardware prices being as they are, and with 60fps now being highly requested in consoles as well, it's pretty much a given.",Negative
Intel,"People accepted upscaling with open arms, so now devs know they can rely on people using it. Thus they don't have to care about optimizing for native res anymore. Oh you have a 4k card? Okay well we'll make sure it can run the game at 1080p so you can upscale it.",Neutral

The game companies can't just implement one gpu company's tech and not the others bc then it'll only work on the one gpu that you implemented the tech for and it won't work on the other gpus from other companies.

Intel,They have really long way to go. Take for example Lords of the Fallen - UE5's TSR is better than FSR. Take Alan Wake 2 and you get ton of shimmering on the edges. It's also not like nvidia not improving - so while AMD makes a step forward so will do nvidia..   There's also question how much they improve without dedicated accelerators that both Intel and nvidia is using. Intel jumped late to the party and they're already ahead - which just shows how much AMD cares. It's rally embarrassing considering both XBOX and PlayStation are also relying on FSR - ant that's bigger market than what nvidia has.,Neutral
Intel,I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?  I mean the facts are the facts. I need to play on lower settings till we get a 5070 or 8800xt.,Neutral

Intel,Consoles are the baseline in most multiplat games and they've been using upscaling since forever. The real reason is just that we don't have GPUs anymore that are 10x faster than consoles like last gen. You can't bruteforce high resolutions in games that run at like 720p on consoles with GPUs that are only 2-3x faster.  If upscaling didn't exist on PC the minimum here would just be 720p at the minimum and 1080p-1440p at the max.,Negative
Intel,Next-gen doesn't mean that current gen can run it well. It means it's so far ahead that most curren-gen hardware can't run it properly + top-end hardware can only barely run it well.,Negative

Intel,"You are correct. I overlooked the part where, under Ultra settings, it said that was with FSR2. Now it doesn't seem as bad. I mean, it's still not good because it's rendering somewhere between 1080p and 1440p, but at least it's not 30 fps without Frame Gen/60 fps with it like I thought.",Neutral
Intel,"It might be, AFAIK neither Nvidia nor AMD still support their implementation of it in their drivers.  But I've tried it on a few games and it is pretty cool to me, much stronger than almost any modern 3D movie (IMO why 3D has gone into hibernation), and I gather that Cameron designed the franchise around 3D.  Plus the Avatar 1 game was in 3D.  FWIW.",Positive
Intel,This is what I am thinking too.,Neutral
Intel,"You say that, but they specifically mentioned FSR3, and just DLSS, so i have a feeling DLSS3 will have to go via a mod again.",Neutral
Intel,"i have a believe that even 4C8T will survive for the decade, like the case of that 4790K. But turns out these newer UE5 games are wrecking even newish CPU like the 3600. i mean cmon it's still a 4 years CPU old which i think it's not old yet",Neutral
Intel,Let's hope so. 30fps is far from recommended for FSR 3,Neutral
Intel,Yeah I heard it works with that hoping it works with fsr3 now,Positive
Intel,"I've noticed that for some reason newer games look blurry at 1080 even without any kind of upscaling and I'm not sure why, older game look much sharper at 1080p",Negative
Intel,"Just lazy optimisation, that’s pretty much a PS5 equivalent GPU and you can be damn sure that the console version won’t be 1080P 30fps with FSR",Negative
Intel,"No it says 5700. NOT 5700XT, and yes there is a difference. Quite literally the difference between a 1070 and 1080ti. Or a 2070 and 2080.",Neutral
Intel,no no my 7 year old card needs to be able to play at high settings. so does my low end card from today. gotta be high or its just bad,Negative
Intel,Crazy expectation? A game released in 2023 should be able to run at 1080p low 30fps on a low end card like rx6500xt (lowest end modern card you can buy now).  Optimization matters.,Neutral
Intel,"Yup, these cards came out around the time of ps4 I think..that's a long time ago in the graphical quality of games we are seeing.  People should be happy to a point that those cards can even run some of these games if upscaling helps them run that's a bonus as it means they don't need to upgrade if those graphics settings are acceptable to them.",Positive
Intel,"I have a 5700 and it does better at 1080p on these games than what is normally posted. Now it does need quality fsr but its not the worst thing, anything lower than quality is. Bottom line is these are not 100% correct and never have been.  I have zero interest in this game but the specs seem fine even though I wish upscaling wasn't what was relied on for optimization.",Neutral
Intel,"well you dont know what they mean by 30 fps. It could be de 1% lows or the average, we dont know. The easy assumption is that it will be 30 fps average. but that's crazy that a game at 1080p low cant be run by a 5700. It better be a new Crysis.  edit: apparently it uses raytracing only for lighting which would explain the hows and why it crushes the framerate so bad especially on a gpu that doesnt have hardware raytracing like the 5700.",Negative
Intel,"Or in the case of games like Alan Wake 2, you will get unplayable fps if you try to running it at 4k native max settings. Even with a 4090, you will get a glorious 20fps.",Neutral
Intel,Assassins creed origins and odyssey side quests/collectibles oh my god,Positive
Intel,Yeah it doesn't give us a actual gauge to understand what we need for set native parameters. I mentioned optimization out of concern that they rely too much on upscaling and it seems like it's the lazy way out of something. It's unrealistic that a usable gaming experience be in a top tier hardware setup that costs $2k+ and top tier hardware of just the last generation are just barely cutting it anymore.,Negative
Intel,I appreciate your insights and opinions. Thank you.,Positive
Intel,">UE 5 is still pretty new, so it might be a problem of most devs not having the knowledge and practice to optimize new tech, or the new tech being used is simply too resource heavy for marginal graphics quality increase.  Because they market how ""good"" it looks, not how ""well"" it runs. There's a big influence from marketing perspective to place high focus on ""eye candy"", it's what sells.  The how ""well"" it runs is usually restricted to the small % of us gaming nerds. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)",Neutral

Intel,> RTX 4080 is 50% Faster than RTX 3080.  The msrp is 71% higher too.,Positive
Intel,"Yeah at 1200 bucks and above you got one, that's true but many cards below didn't offer much.",Neutral
Intel,that's stoopid but it's somewhat more understandable. Why a 5700 would struggle so much since it doesnt have hardware raytracing,Negative
Intel,Yep it's like a 10/15% performance uplift in some games but I'd guess they would prefer to keep the requirements sheets somewhat simple.,Neutral
Intel,Why is there a dialog message about unsupported hardware when you try and run a 390X?,Neutral
Intel,It can do software based RT just like every other modern GPU out there.,Neutral
Intel,Well then no wonder rx 5700 can't manage 30 fps lol,Neutral

Intel,Avatars uses a Lumen like software RT solution.,Neutral
Intel,"yeah they never finished the sentence for some reason. The full sentences is ""its better than native, when native has forced taa!"" which is why dlaa/fsraa at native look so much better than the upscale versions. normal basic TAA is just so bad, that even upscales not using it look better than native using it",Negative
Intel,"The AA side of things might be better, but I swear no matter the resolution textures become a blurry mess even with Quality mode etc, and it irks me that most people don't seem to notice that.",Negative
Intel,Some people seem to have very low sensitivity to added blur. See also *depth of field blur* and *motion blur* being on by default in every game. It's funny how much people rage against FXAA/DoF/Motion blur but ignore DLSS.  Of course only one is tied to someone's purchasing decision :),Negative
Intel,"Yeah, thatsl happened.",Neutral
Intel,">every time I tell them that I can tell the difference between native and upscaled and it's not better then natibe they call me a liar and downvote  Well, yes, you are using shitty FSR which is literally unplayable no matter resolution instead of godly DLSS that is literally better than native even at 720p/performance. The only way you could have seen the ever unmatched DLSS for PC kings instead of the plebean FSR is through a compressed youtube video so your opinion is literally invalid. I hope I am being sarcastic enough.",Negative

Intel,"It is indeed not a great situation. Things like this shouldn't be forced on, and it leaves me feeling like they haven't given the devs enough time to optimize the settings.",Negative
Intel,It works because most consoles players are noobs they don't care about the tech. They just want to sit on the couch and play. I'm hoping we see them start working more on FSR3 and upgrading older games to it. And you are right nvidia will keep moving forward but so will AMD. They may never catch them since they have a head start.,Positive

Intel,The PS5 has a 6700.,Neutral
Intel,">I thought the PS5’s graphics processing was a tad above the 5700XT but far below the 6000 or 30 series?   Not exactly. It's a custom quasi-RDNA2 design (has the improved RDNA2 compute units, but it's missing a few features such as fully-DX12-compliant mesh shaders and VRS-capable ROPs).  For most purposes, it's pretty comparable to a 6700 (non-XT), with the same number of CUs (36), and similar clockspeeds.",Neutral

Intel,TAA,Neutral
Intel,Temporal anti aliasing.,Neutral
Intel,"TAA is the devil. it forces a blur on every frame, and only gets worse as the resolution goes lower. its why fsr, xess, and dlss can look better than """"native"""" because it doesnt use the horrid plain taa solution so many games do. and why dlaa, and fsraa are so important and need to replace taa completely",Negative
Intel,"Ahh, welcome to r/FuckTAA",Neutral
Intel,Even 4K looks blurry with some implementations of TAA,Negative
Intel,they're giving you the bare minimum until your upgrade!,Neutral
Intel,Because they are built with upscaling in mind so they have a blurry looks intentionally as it works best with aggressive upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,"Not even close, you're completely out of your mind. The 5700xt is 9% faster than the 5700. The 1080ti is **32%** faster than a 1070 and the 2080 is **19%** faster than the 2070.

Intel,"The 5700 and 5700xt is more like a 1070 and 1070ti situation. It's not that big a gap, and you can close it even tighter because the majority of RX 5700 cards can be flashed to a 5700xt bios tightening the gap farther.",Negative

Intel,Those are some dumbass expectations. Maybe you should correct them instead of blaming the developers for it.,Neutral
Intel,"The 6500XT offers $200 2016 performance. In fact its often worse because of how gimped it is interface wise. Its one of the worst products released in recent years.  Its not the game developers fault AMD pretty much rebadged the RX 480 4 times and they can't be expected to sink their optimization to that level.  RX 480, RX580, RX 5500XT and RX6500XT are virtualy the same product performance wise. RX 5500XT is the most consistent one of the lot offering a somewhat more modern arhitecture in its 8GB variant. The 6500XT on the other hand while on a newer arhitecture is an unmitigated disaster that is on par at best and sinks even below the RX580 when memory, bus and PCIE interface constrained.  The console baseline is around 6700XT/2070 Super/3060ti level. People better get used to that as its gonna become or already has become the norm for 1080p high settings gaming. The 5700 is upwards of 30% slower by default while also having less hardware features. Its gonna become the minimum norm going forward alongside the 2060's of your time.",Negative
Intel,"the 1070 was 2016, the 5700 was 2019. While both not new its not 10 years old like the PS4 (2013)",Neutral
Intel,This is literally only true if you use path tracing. I think you're trying to insinuate the game is unoptimized when it just scales really high with visual features if your hardware supports it. It straight up runs great for the visual features it uses.,Positive
Intel,"That was exclusive to console releases, no? And never to the point of replacing AA sharpening and rendering the game from 720p…",Neutral
Intel,No I havent. AMD is bigger than Epic.,Negative
Intel,"Right, you'll have different complaints but complaints none the less even though the new Ultra might still look slightly better prior gen games and offer high FPS but people would complain that the graphics are not advancing fast enough, they look the same etc etc.  Yah those days are likely gone but it's hard to say if it's because the game is unoptimized or if the dev is really pushing the limits of what they can do graphically and use upscaling as a buffer because what they have in mind, or what they intend to show is too taxing for current hardware. We won't really know until a game is released  So screaming game is ""unoptimized game, lazy devs"" seems to have just become the norm before anyone's even played it. This is why I've never in my life ever pre-ordered a game. I still don't understand why people do it (esp now that games are digital) but lot of people do. Then again I've never really paid for a ""skin"" or some other visual add-on so maybe that's what attracts people.  I'm not saying games aren't unoptimized, those do exist, they offer nothing more but run like crap. We know what those game are, it's not hard to tell. But then you do have games like AW2, which before release, we were hearing the same exact complaints and it looks amazing and the minimum requirements were on the conservative side. The game looks better at ""medium"" than high/ultra presets of some games, heck you can even argue that at some low settings it looks better than some games at medium/high presets. The presets are all relative anyways. There's no universal settings that define what each preset represents.  I just don't get the outrage on these minimum spec sheets compared to what the game is showing graphically. At least wait until it releases and we have some hard data.",Negative
Intel,"I'm also a dev dood sometimes it's literally a ""foutage de geugle"" I had a friend who talk about how shit devs in EA (the people who's making the engine) code and doesn't optimise",Negative
Intel,"The commenter I replied to said there wasn't a big generational improvement for GPUs, while I said there was. But I agree that 4080 is expensive for what it offers.",Neutral
Intel,It was the same price as a 3090 at launch and offers 90% more performance.  It was definitely a generational leap.,Positive
Intel,It's software ray tracing which isn't accelerated by hardware.,Neutral
Intel,and i guess it can be hard to tell if ram is dual or single rank with just two sticks of it too.,Neutral
Intel,>might be the reason why the AMD GPUs suffer more compared to their Nvidia counterparts.  I was pointing out that 1070 doesn't have hardware RT either.,Negative
Intel,So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?,Negative
Intel,"Why not make it toggleable though, you can choose other graphics settings so it makes no sense. Most people don't play games with RT enabled",Negative
Intel,Still kinda weird that they put the RX 5700/A750 on the same ballpark as the 1070... Being that the newer GPUs actually perform closer to a 1080(Ti).,Neutral
Intel,Sounds like improperly configured negative LOD bias. If you have Nvidia you can fix it with nvinspector. On AMD there's nothing you can do IIRC if Devs mess it up.,Negative
Intel,"Exactly what I'm telling them all the time, that I can see difference in textures, in hair, fences, powerlines etc. And every time I get downvoted by the army of ""but it looks better then native"". I feel like majority of that sub needs to go get a prescription for new glasses",Negative
Intel,"So if you stopped measuring who's bigger, why do you think I have no access to DLSS? Tested on rig with 4080 on a C2 42"" screen. Once you stop thinking with the tip of your head where probably Nvidia's logo is tattooed or maybe Jensen's face, who knows, you could come to realization that one person have access to more hardware then only his personal rig.  Do I say that FSR is better then DLSS? No! Both of them have their issues, but none of them is better then native. Keep on fanboying mate, instead of providing normal convoy as grownups",Neutral
Intel,I don't think YOU understand what you're talking about.  Did you seriously expect Snowdrop to be something used in like one game and then discarded completely?,Negative
Intel,"The thing is: creating good looking lightning with RT is much easier than with prebaked illumination. I can fully understand, why developers of new games are using RT as the basis of their game.",Positive
Intel,Minimum requirements go up as games get/look better. They probably made this game with the series s as the minimum. Low settings probably looks better than high in most games.   Rt for the last few years has been added on top of already complete games. Now games are being made with rt as the standard and they would have to manually do a ton of extra work to support 7+ year old hardware. It's the same as having to drop support for last gen consoles to be able to deliver a better game.,Neutral
Intel,"And still - superior upscaling makes it worth paying extra, RT on higher end is worth paying extra. AMD even this gen doesn't undercut price by enough, especially in EU where power efficiency also play a role. For example, assuming I'm gonna use GPU for 2 gens, then I save ~90-100€ with my usage just on electricity alone. I know it's over period of 4 years, but still it's price difference that will recoup over time, even if I have to pay extra upfront. AMD is simply no longer a value proposition.",Neutral
Intel,"They did not, lol - that fixes completely different thing, not the FSR caused shimmering edges.",Neutral
Intel,Both excellent 👌 Down the Rabbit Hole was another solid one.,Positive
Intel,"RE4 came out this year.  Anyway the difference between us is I don't think any lighting effect is worth a $1,000 GPU using 1080p resolution and 60fps, but I know many disagree. That's life.",Neutral

I find taa usually looks pretty good in modern games, but I'm also playing on a TV (48 inches but I'm not at monitor distance anymore). When I played on my 1920x1200 monitor I HATED TAA, well, not as much as fxaa, but moreso than smaa, and I missed msaa or SGSSAA with a passion. Now on the TV at 4k (lol, usually not on a 6700xt), 1440p, or even 1080p I find TAA can do a pretty decent job paired with varying levels of the Radeon sharpness adjustment in the adrenaline drivers. But again, probably due to viewing distance.  Looks leagues better than FXAA and I prefer it to SMAA now. But again, I'm sitting further away and tweaking sharpening to my liking. FSR2 seems to be a wash most of the time but the performance gain is worth it.",Positive
Intel,You dumbass do understand that even the console version of the recent games are total mess? Alan wake 2 have to run on reduced settings to even reach 30fps on xbox/PS. Callisto protocol used to have frametime issue on consoles. Console ports still targets 30fps on quality settings with upscaling while target should be 60fps with 120fps for performance mode.,Negative
Intel,"Yes, seems you are correct, it was the ps4 pro that came out in 2016, still, I wouldn't expect that to be capable of running some of the games we are seeing now without some serious compromises.",Neutral
Intel,I never said that Alan Wake 2 is unoptimised. I just said that even a 4090 can’t max out the game at native 4K resolution.,Negative
Intel,epic is tencent...,Neutral
Intel,"In terms of absolute numbers sure, 3090 always had a stupid price tho for being 10% faster than a 3080.   In terms of performance per dollar the 4090 even at 2x 3080 performance was worse value since you pay 1600 not 1400.",Negative
Intel,"Yes, you either have to get the spec sheet of the RAM modules (That even then it may not specify if it's a single/dual rank module) or test it in a system and use HWinfo/CPU-Z. Not as straightforward as dual channel that's mostly just using two identical modules.",Neutral
Intel,You don't need RT hardware to do software RT. That's what I'm saying.,Neutral
Intel,"For this particular game, there is a software fallback. Also, even if we did get a game that mandated hardware support for RT they'd still likely build it with console in mind so even RDNA2 GPUs shouldn't have issues",Neutral
Intel,"The first RT/DLSS capable cards are 5 years old now, way older than the current consoles. You are definitely not being left behind if you're only outdated by 1 gen lol",Neutral

Intel,Games running poorly on computers weaker than current gen consoles isn't exactly anything new.,Negative
Intel,"No, you have multiple generations of games from prior to raytracing to enjoy.  Games shouldn't be held back forever just because someone wants to game on a GeForce2 MX400.",Neutral
Intel,You are stuck playing older games. Unless someone can find a way to disable it with a mod.,Neutral
Intel,> So what happens to people with older cards not even ancient but a gen old. Are we officially fucked?  A gen old is second gen RT e.g. rtx 3000.  We're halfway through the third RT/matrix generation right now.,Negative
Intel,Yes hah,Neutral
Intel,"The 3090 or 6950xt will very likely run this game extremely well, they're a gen old.",Neutral
Intel,"For the AMD GPU, it's probably because minimum will be the max it will support. Medium probably requires Hardware RT.  For Intel, I don’t know. Perhaps it signal not so great optimization for Intel GPUs...",Neutral
Intel,DLSS is very strong in thin lines like fences & hair. Much better than most TAA solutions. Not sure about FSR in general.  An example: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6erA6BVkAAuf_M?format=jpg&name=large  Only DLSS resolves the lines properly.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, it's not that black and white. Quality upscaling to 1080 will obviously be more noticeable than 4k. Maybe you *can* tell the difference between 4k native and dlss quality, but people aren't gonna believe you unless you prove it with some kind of blind test, but I doubt you'd be willing to go out of your way to do that.  Even if you could, the benefits of better aa might outweight some negligible drop in textures or whatever it is upscaling reduces.

Intel,Yes.... 7nm was but 4 cores the actual important thing was obsolete like 10 or 12 years ago.,Neutral
Intel,Probably because TAA is (unfortunately) more prevalent than it ever was.,Negative
Intel,"Nah, most people are FINE with it. Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  The thing is, you have sharpening filters today. You can adjust the sharpening for TAA. You can make it look oversharpened if you want. There's driver level sharpening for both AMD and NVIDIA. Both also have software sharpening filters.  And DLSS and FSR bot have sharpening sliders.  There's 3 ways to adjust how blurry and how sharp the game looks for everyone. It's a non issue and even Digital Foundry acknowledges the benefits of TAA for game devs vs things like the blur. At the end of the day, these games are looking great...in this era, with exceptions. Not all games are blur. The whole blur thing was like in the past 4 years since upscalers started and TAA became the norm. But with all the sharpening options, and with devs actually used to making TAA not so soft looking, things are definitely getting a lot better for TAA.",Neutral
Intel,Oh my bad if I read that wrong,Negative
Intel,And I'm saying 1070 doesn't have hardware RT so it's just as gimped as AMD cards when doing RT.,Negative
Intel,Still pretty annoying nonetheless. Until it's stable no way should it be forced upon a game when someone's willing to run it normally at native.,Negative
Intel,"and the 2080ti is still winning, best purchase in gpu i made in a long time.",Positive
Intel,imagine being mad that 4 year old cards arent high end,Negative
Intel,I'm on a 6700XT. 🙇. I just feel very shocked that I would probably need a gpu upgrade soon. With the demands of new games. Also 1440p ruined me.,Neutral
Intel,"Technically makes sense, but they can just make RT something you can toggle between Software/Hardware and they also could just add the Vega 56 in the requirement sheet being that was AMD's competitor to the 1070 or they could've added the GTX 1080(Ti)/RTX 2060(Super) into the sheet.  On Intel's side they only have the A580 as the closest GPU to a 1070, even when it's too similar to the A750 performance wise :/",Neutral
Intel,"It is that black and white for me. I can immediately see the added image softness from upscaling, and it's especially prevalent with DLSS 2.5+ unless you enable a sharpening filter. DLAA also has weird issues like blurring textures (almost like it reverts to initial mipmap) while moving, usually at mid-distance from camera. It's too distracting and I have to go back to regular TAA. Immediately goes away.  1440p to 2160p is better than 720p to 1080p, but it's still noticeable. Detail is immediately lost as lower resolution image is scaled to higher resolution. Is it terrible? No. Actually changing monitor resolution outside of native and having all UI elements scaled looks terrible. That was what we used to do and upscaling is much better than that alternative. LCD panels need to stay at native signal resolution and GPU should scale render resolutions.",Negative
Intel,"And you look at static image all the time while gaming? It's different story when movement is involved, that's where you find all the artefacts you get. Static image doesn't tell a thing when it comes to gaming",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, and that's driving me crazy. I really couldn't stand it in Cyberpunk (in other titles it's either hit or miss), that I play it in native 4k instead.",Negative
Intel,"Wouldn't phrase it like that tough. I had that choice too in January, and actually by going 4070Ti instead of 7900XT I would be able to play Cyberpunk in higher fidelity and better frames then on mine, because AMD cooked FSR3.0 almost a year in the oven, and God knows how long it will take for CDPR to add it to the game, if ever considering that active development on game is ended and they are on bug fixing sprint right now. Also AMD needs to fix FSR in general, because how it works with smaller details like hair and fences is awful. But don't get me wrong, I love my card, just feel I git sold on features that would come handy right kow instead of when I don't need them anymore",Neutral
Intel,"Sorry mate, guess I need to read comments early morning instead of late night, just saw that last bit. My apologies. I'm just tired of upscalare wars whatever sub I go, and green team fanboys screaming that ""FSR is shit, DLSS is better then native"" and then throwing around static images for comparison",Negative
Intel,"It's for textures, not object edges from FSR use, lol. Two completely different things",Neutral
Intel,"people echoing the same shit like ""ooh 4C is obsolete, you need to upgrade that geriatric cpu"". 4C is still solid for gaming (ofc no UE5) and literally anything beside doing compute intensive professional workloads.",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening makes the image less blurry, but it doesn't recover the texture detail lost from TAA blur.",Negative
Intel,"""Even Nvidia foundry""   \---   they are like chief proponents of blur-tech and they don't care about how sharp and easy-to-see the image is. TAA flattens the image so you can't see which objects are far and which are near, you have to strain your eyes and mind to determine that which is unbearable to many. Just give us option to disable it even if it breaks some effects (which is just lazy thing to do on the side of devs)",Negative
Intel,"Sharpening fixes blur, not clearity. That is TAA destroys+add significant ghosting no matter the implementation.      Sharpening looks was worse than the normal cleairy of games, it's not the same thing at all.      >Its people on FuckTAA that are mad.  We are mad because it being forced 1 and 2 it's being used to hide lazy effects that break without temporal frame smearing. People are now punished for turning off forced frame smearing.",Negative
Intel,And I'm saying that maybe the GTX 1070 is better at even software RT compared to AMD cards with no RT hardware. GTX 10 series card did get RTX support through CUDA even though they were horribly bad at it. Older AMD cards with no RT hardware didn't get any support like that from AMD.,Neutral
Intel,"You're not forced to use upscaling though. Unless you replied to the wrong person this is about ray tracing, which can be run at native just fine. If your GPU can't handle RT at native res, then just use upscaling.",Neutral
Intel,The minimum requirements for this game includes de 1070: a 7-year-old gpu from 2016.,Neutral
Intel,"I'm not really shocked, and was out there telling people not to buy those cards on day 1 in large part because of their deficiencies in RT performance and complete lack of matrix accelerators (which Nvidia and Intel have both made a large part of their architecture and got shockingly good results with - DLSS and matrix-XeSS are twice as good as FSR)",Negative
Intel,5700 was probably the lowest AMD card they had to test with.,Neutral
Intel,"It also looks better in gameplay, less ghosting, less shimmering, less aliasing.   So which one looks better? You clearly see the difference in textures/fences/powerline, right?  I even made it easier for you, both images are 1080p output.",Positive
Intel,I personally didn't try DLSS even once but FSR 2.0 does have shimmering I notice to various degrees. It was very noticable on fur in Ratchet & Clank cutscenes for example. Overall I am just happy my 5700xt could still keep up with 1440p.,Neutral
Intel,Hmm yeah whatever you want to believe and let's you sleep.  Have a nice day.,Positive
Intel,AMD CAS is aimed to restore detail,Neutral
Intel,"They aren’t chief proponents of anything, TAAU has been popular for well over a decade at this point and it’s the default approach for consoles (checkerboarding has moire and aliasing issues) and digital foundry simply recognizes this is the reality of how the console world has settled on doing graphics.",Neutral
Intel,The problem with Nvidia is they are massively overpriced. One 4080 would probably cost the same as my whole build or more.,Negative
Intel,"Yes I see which one looks better, and as I said before it's a static image. While I didn't use upscaling in this same exact example, I can go by my own experience and tell that it doesn't look better then native let's say in same Cyberpunk or any other game. And I will beleive my own eyes on my own screen then static images tossed around. TBH, in my opinion it all depends on screen and screen size too, as to me that difference between upscaled and native was less noticible on my old 27"" 1440p screen then it is now on 42"" 4k. DLAA tough, that's another story",Neutral
Intel,"I tried both, and neither of them are better then native as people tend to claim. In my testing FSR have big problem with smaller details like hair, fur, fences, powerlines and as you mentioned, you get severe shimmering effect. I really hope AMD will keep on working on it, an try to get away from that. But DLSS also adds shimmer, it's just less visible then in FSR (atleast in my testing on Cyberpunk pre 2.0), and whatever upscaling method I've used I also could see that image is upscaled (lower res textures here and there etc.). I like idea being upscaling tech, it helps prolong life of GPUs, and for more powerful GPUs to run higher settings with more fidelity, but there's still work to do on them as they aren't perfect yet.",Negative
Intel,Yeah but a 3060ti didn't,Neutral
Intel,"In Cyberpunk you are not comparing upscaling vs no upscaling at the same settings though. You are comparing low RT native vs path traced upscaling and at 4K, the decission there is absolutely clear. On my 4k OLED screen, upscaled PT is so clearly the way to go, there is no competition.",Negative
Intel,"The gameplay looks exactly like the image + your typical TAA/DLSS smearing. And as I said, in my example DLSS also looks better in gameplay, because as you see... native has a ton of aliasing which is super noticeable while playing (shimmering). There are so many objective tests, which show why its most of the time better than native. (up res to 80% instead of 67% and its always way better, even at 1080p)   Well when did you try DLSS the last time? Newest versions are miles ahead of the ""old"" 2.0 version and pretty much always ahead of standard TAA.  DLSS is essentially a way better TAA solution + AI to fight TAAs issues + lower res. Its so much better than your standard TAA, that youre able to reduce the res and it will still look better in movement. Think about it like codecs for streaming... there are codecs which need a way lower bitrate for the same quality than others. (av1)  Everything graphics related is not rendered at full res anyway (shadows/lighting/lod etc...), there is no line between native and upscaling. Talking about native is nonesense, just image quality counts and thats were DLSS or even FSR 2 (some games) gets better and better. There is a reason why consoles use it... it looks better than without it.",Positive

Intel,The future is not in native resolution so this is really pointless information.  Cyberpunk looks absolutelt mindblowlingy insane with all the extra graphical bells and whistles it has gotten over the years and with Nvidia’s technology it runs so damn smooth as well.,Negative
Intel,4.3fps lol. No amount of upscaling is going to fix that and make it playable. People were saying the 7900xtx had 3090ti levels of RT when it launched. A 4060 ti is 50% faster then it.,Negative
Intel,That's actually pretty amazing for any GPU to get a metric in frames per second instead of minuites per frame.,Positive
Intel,"Meh I get like 90+ fps with everything cranked with RR, FG and DLSS(Balanced) toggled on with my 4090 @ 4k.  Path tracing does introduce ghosting which is annoying buts not really noticeable most times but at the same time with RR enabled it removes shimmering on 99% of objects that is normally introduced with DLSS so I am willing to compromise.   Honestly as someone who used to have a 7900XTX I am disappointed with AMD its clear that AI tech in gaming is the way forward and they just seem so far behind Nvidia now and even Intel(going by some preview stuff). FSR is just not even comparable anymore.",Negative
Intel,Who cares when it looks worse than with dlss and ray reconstruction on top of running a lot worse? Native res 4k is pointless.,Negative
Intel,"Well the upscaling in this game is really good, DLSS with ray reconstructions AI accelerated denoiser provides better RT effects than the game at native with its native Denoiser.  Also Path tracing scales perfectly with resolution so upscaling provides massive gains. using DLSS quality doubles performance to 40fps, and dlss balanced gives 60fps on average, performance about 70-80 or 4x native 4K, that includes the 10-15% performance gain RR gives as well over the native denoiser as well.  I've been playing with about 60fps on average 50-70. with DLSS Balanced and RR and its been amazing. I don't like frame gen tho since it causes VRR flickers on my screen",Positive
Intel,"Running Ray Tracing or Path Tracing without DLSS or Ray Reconstruction is like intentionally going into a battlefield without any gear whatsoever, it's absolutely pointless and suicidal, what we can clearly see here though is top of the line 7900 XTX losing against already mediocre mid-range 4060 Ti by over 50%, which is just beyond embarrassing for AMD Radeon.  All this says to me is AMD Radeon need to get their shit together and improve their RT / PT performance, otherwise they will continue to lose more Marketshare on GPU department no matter how hard their fanboys thinks that they are pointless features, just like DLSS was back on 2020 right?  Also, with my 4070 Ti OC i can run it at average of over 60 FPS at 1440p DF optimized settings with DLSS Balanced + Ray Reconstruction without even using DLSS Frame Gen, with it on i can get over 80+ FPS",Negative

I've tried many times with different ray-tracing options and they all look good and all. But in the end I closed them all, turned back to Ultra Quality without ray-tracing and started playing the game over 120FPS.  This is a good action fps game now. I need high fps with as low latency as possible. So who cares about ray-tracing and path-tracing.  Yeah ray-tracing and path-tracing are good. But we are at least 2-3 generations away for them to become mainstream. When they are easily enabled on mid-range gpus with high-refresh rate monitors, they will be good and usable then :)",Positive

Intel,"""Get Nvidia if you want a good ray tracing experience""  Yes Nvidia GPUs give a better ray tracing experience but is it really worth it if you are required to turn on DLSS? Imo, the more AI-upscaling you have to turn on, the worse the Nvidia purchase is.   I have a 6900XT and I will readily admit that the RT experience (ultra RT, no path tracing) at native 1080p resolution is ok, like 30-45 FPS (around 50 on medium RT settings), but if I turn RT lighting off (so RT shadows, sunlight, and reflections are still present) suddenly I get pretty consistent 60 FPS (i left my frames tied to monitor refresh rate, so 60 FPS is my max) and i can't tell the damn difference at native 1080p compared to RT medium or Ultra.   So would I spend another $400-$1000 to get an imperceptible outcome (imperceptible to me that is)? Most definitely not.",Negative

Intel,"Once they introduced this dlss upscaling anti-lag all these gimmicks I don't think we've seen true 4K native and almost anything lately.  This is maybe one game that does look that good but many of the games don't look that great and have some really serious system requirements when there are games that look much better and are much better optimized.  Companies are taking shortcuts, instead of optimizing they give you suboptimal and use FSR dlss all these gimmicks.  Don't get me wrong I always thought it was great for people who wanted to reach a certain frames per second someone with a weaker system to allow them to play at least the minimal at a steady frame rate.  It just seems like this is the normal now non-optimized games.  The 4090 is a beast if you could only get about 20 frames native with Ray tracing it tells you everything you need to know about Ray tracing.  It needs to be reworked that needs to be a new system I believe one real engine has it built in in a certain way probably not as good as Ray tracing directly.  To me it seems like ray tracing is hampering many games that tried to add it, too much focus on that instead of actual making a good game.

Intel,"...but will cost your everlasting soul, body, firstborn and parents. If it's on sale.",Neutral
Intel,It is path trancing though. The technology used by Pixar to make Toy Story 4 (though they spent up to 1200 CPU hours for one frame) Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story. And they had their supercomputers working on it. It is a miracle of modern technology that it even runs real time.,Positive
Intel,"You basically need a 4090 to crack 60 fps at 1440p w/ dlss on quality without frame gen. It looks good, but not good enough to run out and buy a 4090.",Negative
Intel,"Same card, I just turned off RT at 4K. 75-120fps is better than 40 with muddy but accurate reflections",Neutral
Intel,"The 7900xtx is one of the worst gpus iv ever had lol on paper it looks so so good, In games it just play isn’t. Fsr is garbage, 4080 mops the floor with it :( plus the drivers from amd besides starfield have been awful this generation",Negative
Intel,I think that most of the progress will go together with software tricks and upscalers.,Neutral
Intel,"lol. And you missed the 2080Ti.   Every result under 10 fps is just to be ignored, it isn't representing anything outside of ""woot, the card managed to chuck a frame our way"".",Negative
Intel,That's VRAM for you,Neutral
Intel,we are counting decimals of fps its just all margin of error.,Negative
Intel,If you buy a card with low ram that card is for right now only lol,Neutral
Intel,Wake me up when a $250 GPU can run this at 1080p.,Neutral
Intel,Well DLSS isn't best. DLAA is,Positive
Intel,Reviews have been saying that the game looks better with DLSS than native. Not to mention runs extremely better.,Positive
Intel,Can’t you just disable TAA? Or do you just have to live with the ghosting?,Neutral
Intel,TAA is garbage in everything. TAA and FSR can both get fucked,Negative
Intel,"Yeah. 70 to 100fps on a 4080, but with 3440x1440 and DLSS-quality-FG-RR (nvidia needs new nomenclature....)",Neutral
Intel,"same, high refreshrate at 4k with optimized settings + PT + FG. With a 4080 of course, it's insane that it can look and run this great.",Positive
Intel,"Not exactly. Path tracing is just ray tracing, but cranked up to 99% with the least amount of rasterization possible.",Neutral
Intel,"> Give it 2 gens and you are going to get 4k60 here.  Assuming the 5090 literally doubles a 4090 (unlikely), that only gets us to 4K 40hz.  Assuming a 6090 doubles that, 80. which won't be bad.  Going with more conservative 50% boosts. 5090 will give 30. 6090 will give 45.  And i feel like 50% is being very generous, as nvidia have claimed moores law is dead and they can't advance beyond a 4090 by much. I'd guess we get 30% uplift in 5090 and maybe 10-15% uplift in 6090. So we'd still be under 4K30.",Neutral
Intel,Imagine buying a 4090 and then using upscaling.,Neutral
Intel,Path tracing is so much more demanding than ray tracing due to light scattering being modelled. It is a marvel it even runs.,Negative
Intel,PC gaming is in Crysis.,Neutral
Intel,Well it's a good thing 99.999999% of PC gamers don't give a shit about ray or path tracing.,Negative
Intel,You're the first other person other than myself I've run into that had an XTX but ended up with a 4090 in the end.,Neutral
Intel,"Plus frame generation works very well in Cyberpunk in terms of image quality. In some games, you need to get closer to ~80 fps output for an acceptable image quality with FG. But the FG in CP2077 is decent with 60 fps output, ~~and I get ~65-70 fps output with quality DLSS + FG at 4k on a 4090.~~ EDIT: I misremembered what I was getting. With path tracing, DLSS quality, frame generation, and ray reconstruction, I got 80.1 fps with the benchmark!  Of course there's the matter of latency, and the latency of CP2077 with FG output of ~65-70 fps isn't great. So I'll often use DLSS balanced + FG. Thanks to ray reconstruction, this now looks very close enough native 4k (to my eyes), with acceptable latency (to me), at a high framerate output.",Positive
Intel,"Nvidia features are always useless until AMD copies them a year or two later, only then they become great features 😁",Positive
Intel,"Tbh, list the games that have ray tracing right now. Pretty few.  It's not about being a fanboy of amd, but ray tracing as of right now is a gimmick, not because it's unnoticeable or bad, just because it's not ""popular"" (I myself really like it). I would personally go amd over nvidia because those 50 or so euros more that nvidia has against the amd counter parts simply are too much for just better rt and  dlss. I could spend those for a better amd card with generally better performance.  Regarding dlss, personally I would just lower the graphics before resorting to kinda bad generated frames, fsr even worse. But that's my point of view.  I find that amd still has to fix some driver issues but other than that, they are a fine brand. (so is nvidia)",Neutral
Intel,Yeh because native 4k looks worse than dlss + RR 4k,Negative
Intel,"Yeah the game with DLSS, RR and path tracing at 1440p looks amazing and with very high fps",Positive
Intel,What's the point of having $5000 PC when you're still gonna have literally the same graphics as $1000 PC then?,Negative
Intel,"This is a tech demo. That's the whole point. It's not really playable yet, but the game really is meant to showcase what is possible in the future and how close we are getting. That's what Nvidia is doing here by funding this whole project.  Crysis who many people are comparing this to, was in itself quite revolutionary for its time. The destructible environment in Crysis to this day holds up, and that was it's killer feature really.  You're gonna have swings at the future that miss as well, and that's ok.",Positive
Intel,"Did you try DLSS?  Imagine getting down voted for asking if he was using DLSS. What a fragile community. Sometimes it's okay to use DLSS, other times you better not or people will come to your house with torches",Negative

Intel,All graphics you see on your computer screen is fake,Negative
Intel,Path tracing is more demanding than Ray tracing,Neutral
Intel,"That's why I downscale from 1440p to 1080p, running DLSS and using Contrast Limited Sharpening. It looks better than native resolution and still performs well.",Positive
Intel,I guess between the 3090 and the 4070,Neutral
Intel,Yep hahaha,Neutral
Intel,RemindMe! 7 years,Neutral
Intel,"No, this tech is around so game developers can sell more copies of their games by making them look better. The only reason why Nvidia is winning is because their GPUs are much better at intensive ray-tracing.",Positive
Intel,"This is an absurd, fanboyish thought lmao",Negative
Intel,dont let novidia marketing see this youll get down voted into oblivion,Negative
Intel,I would still argue it's still in proof of concept stage. The tech will only become viable once the flagship GPU'S start getting 4k 60fps at native. That will the allow the lower end GPU'S to get 4k 60 or 1440p 60 upscaled.,Neutral
Intel,I mean I have no problem playing at 30fps dlss balance at 1080p DF optimized settings on a 2080ti with pathtracing idc what anyone says RT/PT is the future it just looks so much better than Rasterization,Positive
Intel,"Possibly a little more. Assuming that the leaked 1.7x improvement is right and path tracing performance scales the same, that would be about 34 fps at 4k native. Might be possible to hit 60fps or close to it with DLSS Quality.",Neutral
Intel,It could as well do 60fps if Nvidia adds a lot of path tracing HW into the GPU.,Neutral
Intel,Fanboyism of both kinds is bad,Negative
Intel,"It won't end, but hopefully we see games that have art designed with RT lighting and reflections in mind.  Cyberpunk isn't it. We'd need a full rebuild of the game, every location, every asset and surface remade, so it looks like originally intended by the artists.",Neutral
Intel,Since it needs more than 10gb vram,Neutral
Intel,Cyberpunk is more optimized than majority of games that came out in last two years. Just because you can't run it at 4k 120 fps with path tracing doesn't mean it's not optimized.,Positive
Intel,It’s not unoptimized at all. Game runs great for the quality of the graphics. You guys just don’t understand the insane amount of power path tracing takes. The fact you can do it at all rn is insane but once again people just throw “unoptimized” at it because they don’t understand the technical marvel happening in front of their eyes.,Negative
Intel,"No, this game is actually very well optimized. It's just extremely demanding at 4k native, which is why DLSS exists.  It would be unoptimized if it ran like this while looking like nothing special, but this is probably the game with the best graphics, period. At the very least, it's certainly the game with the best lighting.",Positive
Intel,"and people will be like ""well RT is the future""  raster was fine for over 15 years and raster games look great but we get it we must let incompetent game devs and their bosses make shit quality games because average gamer is ready to spend $100 to pre-order electronic version of horse shit and then justify it for years because they can't admit they wasted money",Negative
Intel,It's settled that you have no idea what you talking about,Negative
Intel,Its full path tracing u cannot really optimize this much.,Negative
Intel,"It always did. Most games don't scale well, Cyberpunk does.  Look at the last two years of pc ports and you will understand how cyberpunk looks and performs like it's black magic.",Negative
Intel,"Baked illumination requires you to choose where to add light sources and how the lighting is applied to everything, it's a creative choice of the author, the AI needs instructions to know what to do, so it would need constant handholding, on the other hand RT uses simple physics to calculate how light bounced and NN to apply the light on surfaces.",Neutral
Intel,But the destructable environment and the water graphics and other things in Direct X 9 made high end pcs kneel as well.  I remember playing on my 9800gtx/+ with my Intel Q9300 quad core (lapped and oc'ed to 3.0ghz - EDIT: checked some old evga posts got it to 3.33ghz) with 2x4gigs DDR2 @1000mhz cas 5 trying to maintain a sustained 30fps at 900p resolution on my 1680x1050 monitor. And I oc'ed the crap out of that 9800gtx 835 mhz (cant recall if it was unlinked shadder or not now) core on blower air (won the silicon lottery with that evga card).  Tweaking settings was mostly user done and guided with old school limited forum help. Ahh the good old days of having lots of time during school breaks.,Neutral
Intel,"The equivalent of a 4090 at the time, 8800 ultra (768MB) got 7.5 fps at 1920x1200 very high quality. The other cards were not able to run it. Even the lowest tier last generation card runs this, even though it's at 5% speed.",Neutral
Intel,No and no again lol  The 8800gtx could do 1152x864 high and that was the top dog. DX9 cards could do that at medium but high shaders was like a 25fps average tops and that dropped into the teens on the snow level.   It took things like the gtx480 and HD 6970 to do 1920x1080 30fps max settings. That's before getting into Sandy Bridge being the first cpu that could sustain 40+ fps if the gpu power was there.   Crysis came during the core 2 duo/k8 athlon and first wave dx10 cards era and it took *2 more generations* of *both* gpus and cpus to do it some justice.,Neutral
Intel,"My 8800ultra was getting single digit fps at 1080p ultra, so CP isn't quite as demanding.",Neutral
Intel,Amd had a tessellation unit. It went unused but it was present,Neutral
Intel,"My fun story for PhysX was Mirrors Edge. I don't remember what GPU I had at the time but the game was pretty new when I played it. Ran fine for quite some time until one scene where you get ambushed in a building by the cops and they shoot at the glass. The shattering glass with PhysX turned on absolutely TANKED my framerates, like single digit. I didn't realize that the PhysX toggle was turned on in the settings. This was at a time when PhysX required a dedicated PCIe card in your system.   Once I turned it off it ran fine. Now I can run that game at ridiculous framerates without my system getting warm.",Positive

When NVIDIA found this out they pushed out drivers that disabled PhysX on their cards if an ATI/AMD card was detected, limiting you to the intentionally piss-poor CPU implementation of PhysX.  Think about that crap.  One day everything's going fine for consumers, the next day NVIDIA decides they don't like how consumers are legitimately using their cards and gimps everyone, weaponizing a physics engine company that they bought in 2008.",Negative

Intel,>PhysX  It never was a dedicated Nvidia card - it was a [dedicated psysx](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/bfg-ageia-physx-card/) on which the tech later was bought by Nvidia and implemented in it's own GPU's.  But the things never became really populair.,Neutral
Intel,"This makes me wonder if we'll ever see something similar with Raytracing, where we get a 2nd GPU purely for RT, and then the main GPU just does all the other stuff. Would that even be possible?",Neutral
Intel,I remember when people had a dedicated PhysX card.,Neutral
Intel,The ray/path tracing in this case done by specialized hardware which has more room to grow faster.,Neutral
Intel,"I would, transistor shrinking isn't the only method of increasing performance, and honestly, these companies have to keep putting out better cards to make money.  There have been many breakthroughs over the last few years. I give it another 5 as both amd and nvidia are pushing ai accelerated ray tracing on their cards, nvidia is in the lead for now but amd will eventually catch up.",Positive
Intel,There is still a big leap possible since all lithography processes at the moment are hybrid euv and duv.   But the moment everything is done euv things will drastically slow down.,Neutral
Intel,"No those are just pennies in the pocket of Nvidia, but as the consequence you as the customer need to take a mortgage on a brand new GPU.",Neutral
Intel,"Yeah the next 10 years are gonna be spent getting budget cards up to 4090 level performance, rather than bringing the bleeding edge to 5-10x the 4090 performance. As long as 4K is king, there’s not much incentive to do the latter.",Negative

Intel,Love how it's still gimped on memory size 😂,Positive
Intel,"They just need to render the minimum information needed , and let the ai do the rest",Neutral
Intel,"Don't get upscaling, to me it looks shite. Why spend hundreds or thousands on a GPU to not even run at native resolution.   It's something Nvidia are pushing because they've got a better version of it at the moment.  Maybe it'll improve, it's pretty much snake oil currently imo.",Negative
Intel,"Feels pretty good with 120 frames. Playing with a controller, i don‘t mind or even feel the input lag on a projector screen.",Positive
Intel,"It's mad that even with a 4090 running games at 4k, they still look less realistic than the low-res FMV sequences in The 7th Guest from 30 years ago.",Negative
Intel,"Do keep in mind that despite both being named the same, the devil's in the details. Movies use way more rays per scene and way more bounces too.   Path tracing in CP2077 shows temporal artifacts due to denoising, something that doesn't happen in movies. It is being improved with the likes of DLSS 3.5, but it is still quite off when compared to said movies.",Neutral
Intel,"Keep in mind the systems that rendered toy story 1, costing upwards of like 300k IIRC, have less power than your cell phone today and were super delicate/finicky machines. There's a dude on youtube that got a hold of like the second best one that was made at the time and the machine honestly was really impressive for when it came out, but it pales in comparison to even a steam deck really.",Neutral
Intel,"> Path tracing used to take up to a day per frame for films like the original Toy Story  Toy Story didn't use path tracing though, A Bug's Life was Pixar's first movie to use ray tracing (not path tracing) and only for a few frames in the entire movie for specific reflections, they started using ray tracing more generally for Cars and I can't find exactly when they started using path tracing but it should be around the early 2010s which is also when the other Disney animation studios started using path tracing",Neutral
Intel,No it's not a miracle. Because it's downscaled a lot and also uses lower quality math and piggybacking on AI to make up for it. It's basically running through 3 layers of cheats to produce results that aren't that much better than just traditional raster.,Negative

Intel,"Hell playing path tracing with my 2080ti at 25 FPS is still looks absolutely fantastic, I would absolutely play with pathtracing on a 4090 constantly. Idc dlss looks great with RR even at 1080p. I won’t upgrade for another year or 2 (just bought a phone so I’m broke right now)",Positive
Intel,4090 getting 60fps at 4k balanced dlss with no frame gen. 100 with frame gen. I can make it drop into the 20s if I stand right next to a fire with all the smoke and lightening effects or if I go to a heavily vegetated area it’ll drop to mid 40s. But it’s stay consistently at 55-65 and even goes Into the 90s if I head out of the city.   Haven’t tried it at quality or with dlss off though. May go do that now that it says only 19fps lol. Have to try it to see for myself,Neutral
Intel,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-dlss-35-tested-ai-powered-graphics-leaves-competitors-behind  Well it's so close (54fps) it's more like a 3080Ti or higher from 3000 series or a 4070TI + from 4000 series it seems? The old 3000 series is punching way above it weight vs the 7900xtx, which was meant to deliver similar RT performance to the 3090.. which it doesn't.",Neutral
Intel,At some point the RT pixels are so expensive that native resolution w/o DLSS and frame gen is just not gonna work for the time being.,Negative

Intel,The game look is ruined on PT it makes everything look completely different.  Regular RT keeps the style of the game and performs good.,Positive
Intel,Dont use useless raytracing and you wont have any problems lol,Negative

Intel,Only people who don't give a shit about high quality graphics don't care about ray tracing.,Negative
Intel,I got a stupidly good deal on the 4090(buddy won an extra one from a company raffle) and it just so happened my XTX was one of the cards suffering from the mounting issue on release.  Honestly very happy that all of that happened. Sure I would have been happy with the 7900xtx if I got a replacement but the 4090 just kinda blew me away especially with all the DLSS tech behind it.,Positive
Intel,"Nvidia used cp77 as a testing grounds for their dlss3 and rt tech, it'd no surprise it looks and performs relatively good, they literally partnered with cdpr for that.  Do not expect these levels of RT on most games anytime soon, probably in a couple years (with rtx 5000 series) the tech will be more mature and not as taxing for most cards, because needing to upscale and use framegen to get 60fps on an RT PT setting is kinda absurd.",Negative

Intel,"There are a lot of new games that features Ray Tracing on them as of now, too bad most of them doesn't look as visually as good as they could be though as most of the time their RT effects are dumbed down or reduced to the point it's pointless.  But the thing is that wasn't the point even from the beginning, RT Overdrive on Cyberpunk is literally considered as a Technological showcase  What matters here IMO for all of us is PC platform in general is showcasing here what a real high-end computers can achieve beyond what current gen console can do, and they are showcasing it really well here on Cyberpunk with much better visuals and using plenty of tricks to make them more than playable, where they shouldn't be considering how much demanding they are over standard, that is impressive enough to me and shows a good sign of technological engineering innovation.   As what Bryan Catanzaro said on his interview on DF Direct, work smarter not harder, brute force is not everything, of course it still matters a lot but doing it alone is starting to become pointless just like how it is on real life.",Negative

Intel,Nice but ive been playing video games since the 70s and its Shit end off..,Negative
Intel,The future of frame generation is going to be huge. I can definitely see 360p frame rendering upscaled to 4k with 80% maybe even 90% of the frames being generated. All with equal to or even better visual quality.   A 20 FPS game like this will become a 100-200fps game.  We may be looking at the end of beefy graphics cards being required to play games. Just a good enough mid or low tier chip (granted 5-10 years from now) with frame generation might be enough.,Positive
Intel,"After 2.0, it's around 100""fps"". Just 60""fps"" (meaning with FG enabled) is far from being playable due to latency. You need at least 90""fps"" for playable experience.   Cyberpunk PT vs RT is a huge difference in terms of graphics, while DLSS Quality vs Balanced is really slim in comparison. What you say would be a really bad trade-off.   At 1440p DLSS Quality it's easily 120+""fps"" which is perfectly comfortable.",Neutral

So the fact that Cyberpunk takes more than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame in its path-tracing mode on a single 4090 clearly means that it's unoptimized garbage! /s  EDIT: Apparently people in this thread don't understand sarcasm (or don't understand how a path-traced game can take longer than 0.05 seconds to render a 4k frame with high-poly path tracing and still be optimized).,Negative

Intel,"CPU PhysX back then was single-threaded and relied on ancient x87 instructions if I recall correctly, basically gimped on purpose.

It may or may not make sense to maybe have a raster chiplet and a ray tracing chiplet on the same processor package on a single gpu. But, probably makes more sense to have it all on one chiplet, and just use many of the same chiplet for product segmentation purposes instead.   A separate PPU did make sense tho, I'm still annoyed that the nvidia ageia deal essentially kill the PPU in the cradle.

Intel,"Weird argument.  Traditional raster is cheats upon cheats upon cheats already.  In fact, all of the lighting entirely in raster is essentially cheats.",Negative
Intel,It will not work well/look good using a single frame worth of data either due to the low ray counts. Digital Foundry has shown Metro Exodus builds the lighting over ~20 frames or so and it seems like Cyberpunk is even more. Even Cyberpunk ray pathtracing doesn't look as good in motion due to that same build-up effect.  You need to cast 20-50x the rays to have enough data for a single frame but then you will be measuring the game performance by seconds per frame.,Negative
Intel,"RT looks significantly better than raster when it’s not just using simple reflections like a Far Cry 6. Raster is all cheats, the so called reflections are essentially rendering the scene or part of the scene being reflected in reverse then applying fake material effects to mimic metal, water, etc. Raster also takes HUNDREDS to thousands of person hours to get the fake reflections and lighting to look decent to good. That’s why devs love RT and want it to grow, as RT/hardware does the work for them.",Negative

Intel,It's not a perfect way of measure but you can clearly see how (at least on Nvidia GPUs) the 8/10GB cards are way behind the >11Gb cards. Meaning you need 11 or 12GB of VRAM for this scenario which cripples the 3080 but not the 3060.  We said from the start these configurations are shit but no-one listened. There you go.,Negative
Intel,The crypto miners did me a comical solid by preventing me from acquiring many countless times and hours I wasted (came from a gtx1070 before finally being able to upgrade). Was able to get my 6900xt eventually for around $600 with 2 games. Becoming increasing thankful for the extra Vram these days.   Once I start getting through my game backlog and into the gard hitting ray tracing ones will hopefully upgrade to something with at least 24gigs of GDDR# lol.,Positive

Intel,"I expect path tracing support to be the exception for a while because most developers will consider the non-trivial dev time to implement it not worth it.

Interestingly, [the recent Alan Wake II DLSS 3.5 trailer](https://youtu.be/HwGbQwoMCxM?t=36) showed the game running at ~30 fps at native 4k when path-tracing (presumably on a 4090). That's substantially faster than than how fast a 4090 runs Cyberpunk on the path tracing mode. Presumably, a less complex world helps, but they may also have implemented opacity micro maps, which I'm not sure if Cyberpunk has done in the 2.0 update. Perhaps they're cherry-picked examples for the trailer.",Neutral

Intel,You can already have 120fps on $1000 PC,Neutral
Intel,It improves both looks and fps so it is a win win,Positive
Intel,"The issue with this is the inputs will only be registered at 20Hz. This would feel awful. The benefit of high FPS is having very low latency. This will just make it look smoother, not feel any better than 20 FPS",Negative
Intel,Considering there is no input on the generated frames that is going to feel horrible to play. Base FPS (incl DLSS) really still needs to be 50-60fps to feel playable imo.,Negative
Intel,I'm thinking will there ever come a day where 100% of frames are generated by AI. Like the data inputs directly from the card into the neural network and it no longer requires physical hardware limitation to generate frames.,Neutral

Intel,"The thing about ray and path tracing is that they are demanding on their own, not because they are badly optimised",Negative
Intel,"I have a 4070. It runs the game just fine with the tools that have been set in place.  This is absolutely not a pissing match. Cyberpunk is demanding, and takes advantage of lots of tech available for upscaling and ray tracing and frame generation. AMD card’s currently do not match Nvidia’s in those categories, not even close. This us not an attempt to showcase Nvidia tech, but it does take advantage of it.",Negative
Intel,Because it's not about the flagship card. Only if the flagship can attain good performance at native then you will have headroom for lower end cards. Think about it. Of course upscaling is very important. But you also need some headroom to upscale.,Neutral
Intel,"Yeah. I wanted better cooling performance after upgrading to the artic freezer 7 as well with those weird crapy plastic tension clips you pushed in manually, fearing bending them (worse than the stock intel cooler tension twist lock). Kept having random stability crashes until after i sanded it down for better thermals...Good old sandpaper and nerves of steel fearing an uneven removal of the nickel coating.  Was trying to maximize performance as back then core 2 duo and the extreme versions were king and they had way higher single core clocks and were easy to oc. Wanted the multhreaded for Crysis, LoL (back when you had to wait 5min+ to get into a game), BF2, and was eventually playing TF, Day of Defeat and Natural Selection.  My upgrade back then was to the Evga 560ti DS, which I ended up installing a backplate and  a gelid cooler. They had wayy better thermal tape/individual heatsinks for the memory/vram chips for the heat transfer. Evga back then told me if I ever needed to RMA it that I would just need to re-assemble it as it was shipped. Remember using artic solver ceramique instead of as5 due to it potentially not degrading as fast as well.   Good times =)",Negative

Remember in 2011 upgrading to a gtx 570, the first gen with tessellation and playing dragon age 2 which was one of the first games to have it. Ended up turning off tessellation cause it hit the card too hard, least until I got a second 570 in sli, which sadly died like a year later due to heat while playing Shadow Warrior.",Positive

Intel,"There was more nuance to that ""bugfix"" than just ""it was a bug that got fixed""   Modders were able to re-enable the AMD/NVIDIA PhysX combo basically immediately via editing DLLs.  Not driver replacements, but actual DLL tweaks.  The speed at which modders were able to fix what NVIDIA ""broke"" combined with the public outrage put them in a funny legal spot.  If they continued with PhysX disabled and claiming it was a bug then the bug can easily be fixed, as shown by modders doing it first.  So either fix it and get everyone back to normal, or leave PhysX disabled even though it can be easily enabled and open the company up to potential anti-competitive lawsuits.  Obviously not many modern games use the GPU implementation of PhysX anymore and the performance difference between current GPU and CPU implementations are negligible anyway, but their intent at the time was clear once it was shown how quickly modders were able to get everyone back to normal.",Neutral

Intel,I like how you said: static image  because in motion upscaling is crappier,Neutral
Intel,"It isn't a weird argument. Rasterization is premised on approximating reality, while RT is simulating it.  The extreme few amount of rays we trace right now, including bounces, means effects are often muted and the performance hit is enormous. To compensate, we're using temporal upscaling from super low resolutions *and* frame interpolation.  Temporal upscaling isn't without it's issues, and you know how much traditional denoisers leave to be desired. Even Nvidia's Ray Reconstruction leaves a lot to be desired; the thread on r/Nvidia shows as much, with ghosting, artifacts, etc. all over again. It's like the launch of DLSS 2.0.  All of that, for effects that are oftentimes difficult to perceive, and for utterly devastating traditional rasterization performance.",Negative
Intel,"It's a shame raster is so labor intensive, because it looks so interesting when done right.     I look at screenshots from cyberpunk, Raster / Ray Trace / Path Trace, and in most of them the raster just looks more interesting to me. Not constrained by what would be real physical lighting. The 100% RT render versions of old games like Quake gives a similar feeling.     But I imagine there will be more stylistic RT lighting over time, it saving a ton of labor is all things considered good, freeing it up for actual game design.",Positive

PT just looks and feels way more natural than just RT, when only raster literally looks like it was two different games from two different hardware generations.

I never could, couldn’t even afford a PC until this past summer.   This obsession with performance metrics is ridiculous. Like, less than 5% of PC gamers even have 4k monitors. Almost 70% still have 1080p.   CDPR made a VERY demanding game that looks GORGEOUS completely turned up. Modern hardware cannot handle it natively, it can’t. It is not a gimmick that a company has developed a superior technology that allows the game to be played at almost the same quality as native, significantly smoother and faster. You’re in denial if you think otherwise.  I’m not tied to either brand. I have an AMD CPU bc it was the best option for what I wanted, and a Nvidia GPU for the same reason. I care about RT, frame gen, all of that. The Witcher 3 still is my favorite game, and the entire reasoning for building a gaming PC over a console is graphical quality and speed while doing so. That game is absolutely gorgeous with RT on. Same with Cyberpunk, which I can enjoy thanks to DLSS.   You don’t care about those things? That’s fine, but it is solely a personal opinion.",Negative
Intel,"Yea well I was defining an arbitrary performance. It's not about having native performance. But, but if a flagship is able to get 4k 60 with path tracing at native then that allows headroom for 60 tier or 70 tier cards to perform well.  In this example the 4090 gets 19.5 fps at 4k. The 4060ti gets 6.6 fps. Let's assume a next gen flagship is able to reach 60 fps at 4k. That would theoratically allow the 60ti card to reach around 20 fps. Once you do your various upscaling and frame generation techniques you can then reach 60 fps ideally with a mid range card.",Neutral

It's like teaching a kid how to illustrate shadows on an ball vs the how light actually works. Raster techniques have evolved a lot since then, and use raytracing in limited contexts, screen space reflections and ambient occlusion for example, but they're still operating with extremely limited data in narrow, isolated use cases, which is why they often look awful.

Intel,"By NVN do you refer to Nintendo's API for nvidia? Or you wanted to refer to NVK that got into mesa?  By CUDA alternative I mean stuff like ROCm. CUDA have so many years of development on top of it and a stupidly widely support from software vendors.  While yes, NVK could help to alleviate the issue, is not even close to what native CUDA can do regarding GPU usage for general computing.  The issue with ROCm is mainly a lack of support on a lot of software and lack of support for a lot of hardware.  On the nvidia end you can get the cheapest trashiest GPU and it will have the same level of CUDA support as the most expensive enterprise product.  Yes, performance is not the same, but I can use a 3090 Ti for loads that needs more than 12 GB vram without needing to buy a dedicated AI GPU, and if a given task needs serious shit, then again, I can buy a dedicated solution that will run the exact same software with the exact same code I ran on the ""weak"" 3090 Ti.  That is not possible with AMD, if you buy an enterprise grade GPU from them, you need to build all your software stack for it instead of just moving it and keep going.  And while yes, developers from tools like PyTorch COULD improve their ROCm support, I totally get why they are not doing that. ROCm works on like what? 7 GPUs? On specific linux distros?  Is a matter of scalability and costs. ROCm needs to be supported on ALL AMD GPUs in order for it to be something worth developing for, otherwise there is not really a use case where the end user wont be writing their own stack.  And again, if you can start small, then scale up, nvidia is the only option, so AMD on this space is either ""I got a stupidly great offer where AMD provides the same hardware power and performance per watt at like half the prize so I justify building all my software from scratches"" or ""Ok, I'll go for nvidia and just use all the software already built for it and call it a day""  I really, really want to being able to use AMD GPUs aside of trivial tasks, but this is a very, VERY gigante issue that appears a lot, especially on the profesional space.",Neutral

Intel,"> There is something important here though, Intel is way better at software stack than AMD, and current GPUs rely A LOT on the software stack to perform.  Agreed, not to mention that when they made Alchemist, yes their target was 3070 and they underperformed that, but they will eventually hit their targets as they learn to improve their architectures. For a first shot, getting to around 85-90% of their target is actually quite good. It's not like they undershot by 50% of the target. They got close.   But like you said, software is super important and these days having good software is half of a driver. I have an A770, the driver actually pretty good, like the software menu. It used to suck when it first came out because it was some crap overlay, but over time it's become a separate program and it works really good considering they're not even a year into Arc's release. They also have a good set of monitoring tools built in and the options are all simplified. They don't have super unnecessary things like a browser integrated into the driver suite, or a bunch of other stuff. I'm sure by the time Celestial is around if Intel does stick with Arc, that they will be ahead of AMD on the software game, assuming AMD continues down the same path they have now.  > Nvidia's 4000 series did just that to RT.

Intel? Intel started working on XeSS even before releasing their first consumer grade GPU.  Yep because Intel recognises that to get close to NVIDIA they not only have to make great hardware, but also great software to go along with it. You can only do so much with hardware to match NVIDIA. You have to make great software along with in-game solutions like XeSS to match NVIDIA. FSR is behind not only DLSS but now also XeSS. AMD is just not competitive with NVIDIA on all fronts.

Now that Intel is working on dedicated GPUs they are going to eventually create APU like products, its just the natural outcome of producing both CPUs and GPUs.  And then AMD will NEED to compete against them instead of being the only option.  And if that happens, unless FSR gets turned into a hardware specific tech like XeSS that falls into different techs depending on the GPU its running on, AMD will be murdered.

GPU utilization is the one that is far more useful for spotting bottlenecks, general performance observations are far more useful for tweaking.  Even Intel and co. will tell you that with modern processors and all the elements they contain as well as hyperthreading/SMT CPU utilization isn't a very useful stat anymore.

My first gaming rig was a gaming desktop with 64gbs ddr4 3200mhz, rtx 3060 12gb, 850w platinum psu, b660m gigabyte motherboard and a intel i5 13600kf. Couldn't have had a better first rig.my current build now is a hellhound raedeon rx 7900xt,gigabyte  z790x ax gaming motherboard,  850w platinum psu, 64gbs ddr5 6000mhz,Samsung 980 1gb ssd, intel i5 13600kf(watercooled).best upgrade I made for 1440p gaming.",Positive

Intel,I don't understand the stickers. Ryzen CPU Check. Both Radeon and GTX graphics? Is one discrete and the other dedicated? Just needs an Intel sticker to make it more confusing.,Negative
Intel,"That is not a ""gaming rig"" not even close my friend. ;)",Negative
Intel,3050ti?  Gaming rip?  No,Neutral
Intel,"5 or so years ago i built my first real gaming rig. Few years later i bought new laptop, because i already had a gaming pc i wanted something capable to game but didnt want to spend too much money for high end. So i bought Lenovo legion with same gpu - 3050ti.   What i soon realized was that i love the comfort of being able to browse the net and game from the couch, being able to put my legs up, put my back against a big pillow etc... Despite having much more capable pc, i was lazy to play on it and was using gaming laptop instead 90% of the time.   Problem is, 3050ti in the last year or so really starting to show its limitations, most of new games are straight up unplayable anymore. Even on lowest settings it doesnt run newest games at playable standards, probably because of only 4gb of vram. Hogwartz, Rachet and Clank, Remnant 2 all pretty much unplayable unless you drop resolution to 720... I really regret not putting few hundreds more for something like 3070. (unrelated, but why stepping up laptop gpu tiers are so expensive, for example 3060 to 3070 is like 300e here for essentially same system otherwise, 3070 to 3080 is like 4-500e extra more, its even more expensive overall than desktop gpu tiers for way lesser performance improvements...).   So my advice would be, if you can get at least 3060, its worth it to pay up a bit more, ideally 6600m or 4060, those few hundreds increase in price will be worth in a few years.  ALSO: not sure if OP knows, but these laptops come with shittiest ram, upgrading it to a dual channel dual rank is pretty much a must as it nets 10-20% more performance.",Neutral
Intel,There is nothing wrong with laptops I'd build my own if there was a market readily available for it like a desktop.,Neutral
Intel,No!,Neutral
Intel,"This isn't exactly what I'd imagine hearing the words ""gaming rig"" but I'm glad you like it. Happy gaming!",Positive
Intel,Ignore the haters dude. Congratulations on your new gaming laptop. Gaming is something that is supposed to make us happy not cater to snobs. Not everyone needs 4k 60fps. If it satisfies your requirements it's the best rig for you. I have a Ryzen 5 2500u and I game on that so I am super happy for you.,Positive
Intel,"People take things too seriously, and tend to forget that every enthusiast was once a novice.  This is OP's first gaming setup; they deserve to feel that excitement.",Negative
Intel,who even buys the 'very best' laptop anyway?,Negative

Intel,I upgraded the ram. Has 16gb ddr 5 dual channel now,Neutral
Intel,"Thanks dude! I think people forget that not everone needs the same kinda thing from a computer which is why they sell multiple models.  This is great for what I need it for, and I feel like a kid at Christmas, happy to be able to dip my toe into PC gaming, finally!",Positive
Intel,You get my point at least you should,Neutral
Intel,"Just to let you know , these laptops have different versions , one I have is something like Ar15mhqp or some shit like that   It is less powerful than yours but decent enough",Negative
Intel,That is okay if you see that way and congrats.,Neutral
Intel,"There's nothing ""rig"" about a laptop. Laptops aren't built to be rigged.",Neutral
Intel,"No, it's a notebook.  Also have a low end gpu dude.  Not a game rig. It's nice but is not that.",Negative
Intel,"I know, but the same laptop or any other with 6800m or other AMD gpu would have been a much better choice lol",Neutral
Intel,All that matters is that your happy with it,Positive
Intel,Glad you’re enjoying it. People something think that unless you get something with everything maxed out then you couldn’t be happy lol,Positive
Intel,"Yeah I'm just happy to be able to start playing around on some games on PC now. I've wanted to play flight simulator on pc instead of my xbox for ages now becuase of all the addons,and now i'll have access to those :D",Positive
Intel,"3050ti isn't really low end. And it will do for everything I need it for. I have an Xbox too for the most modern stuff.  People think that everyone has to have 4k 60fps in every game these days and not everyone needs or wants that, especially in a first machine.",Negative
Intel,"for you maybe, this fits my needs perfectly.",Positive
Intel,"Yup I am more than happy!  I've only ever had and played with integrated graphics on any other laptop I've had so this is a huge step for me.  I will play most brand new stuff on my Xbox for the best ecperience but stuff like KF2 I can now play a 1080p ultra and get 100s frames, could only play that before at 900p low.",Positive
Intel,Well you say that right now but one day a game you really wanna play will come and your pc will be shitting itself trying to run it. If I had the money I would buy the best rig.   But if you don’t have a lot of money like me it’s all about price/performance,Negative
Intel,That is the important that you are happy but still the reality is one.  Just enjoy the notebook.,Positive
Intel,"not too similar but I can recommend grabbing dirt rally 2.0 on a steam sale with all DLC for 8€ / $10 or whatever it is, generally games that simulate some things are pretty much at home on PC",Neutral
Intel,"Yes, the 3050 ti is a low end card.",Neutral
Intel,I have an Xbox too so I'll be able to play it on there anything that is out of spec.,Neutral
Intel,I have a friend playing Baldurs Gate 3 on a 980/ You don't know what low end is apparently lmfao,Negative
Intel,It's better than the 1650 and the 2050 though. And they were the other choices.,Positive
Intel,And that is normal the game don't requiere a big gpu to run the game is a mid / low graphics.  Besides the 980 was the top of that generation. The 3050 is the low end of that particular generation.,Neutral
Intel,"Dont let the haters bring you down dude, if you are happy, then enjoy your new laptop!",Positive
Intel,"Both cards are the lowest version of his generation.  Again the notebook is nice but is a low end ""gaming"" notebook and again the point is that you ENJOY IT and play many games.",Positive
Intel,He needs to know what he have but also I congrats OP for your purchase. The point is that you enjoy it.,Neutral
Intel,"I actually like the idea of discrete GPU naming scheme for the new iGPU, 300 series for integrated graphics is really makes sense but they should add 'M' suffix to make it clear.",Positive
Intel,"I'm surprized to see nothing between 4 and 10 Xe3 cores. Seems like there's a lot of room in there for something like an 8-core B360 iGPU or even a 7-core B350.  Also looks like the 3\_8 and 3\_6 versions are differentiating maximum boost clocks, though I wonder if instead those may reflect that configurable upper TDP bound. Might make sense for 65W and 80W to be differentiated if that will coincide with anything about the ""experience-based"" PL1 behavior.",Neutral
Intel,There are 2 dies.  One for professional workload which will be mass produced.  Second is for gaming. Even a 10-12 core xe3 will be barely enough for modern 1080p. Lunarlake can only run alanwake at 1080p at low settings getting only 25 frames so even if this is 50-100% better this is the minimum for a 2026 product.   I see no point of a 8 xe3 core system when all people will do is just complain.,Negative
Intel,"quite confusing, Xe3 should start from C (celestial), if using name like B390  we think this  is a battlemage Card (Xe2)",Neutral
Intel,"A clock speed regression vs the prior gen on N3B, with a remark that it's difficult to cool, really isn't a good look for the process side. 18A branding with more like N4 performance...",Positive
Intel,"i mean i get this is a laptop part but man 16 threads is not much to phone home about when it comes to horsepower, isnt next gen desktop aiming for something like 48 threads?",Negative
Intel,Still weaker than x3d,Neutral
Intel,">I'm surprized to see nothing between 4 and 10 Xe3 cores. Seems like there's a lot of room in there for something like an 8-core B360 iGPU or even a 7-core B350.  The 10 Xe3 core model is a binned down 12 Xe3 N3 die, and I doubt yields are so bad that they would even be able to find more dies where they have to disable more cores.   The other die is the 4 Xe3 Intel 3 die, so you can't go up from there.",Neutral
Intel,To be fair Alan Wake 2 low settings look great. This was covered by DF awhile back they said in some ways Alan Wake 2s low settings look better than some modern games high.,Positive
Intel,"I mean, but that logic, most of Intel's historical bigger iGPUs don't make sense. There are use cases other than AAA gaming. Media creation is another big one.",Negative
Intel,What're you doing on a laptop?,Neutral
Intel,"These are for thin and light office notebooks and light gaming. Think Lunar Lake. For CPU power, Nova Lake H will exist.",Neutral
Intel,Nobody buys AMD laptops,Negative
Intel,">Still weaker than x3d   Source?? Also Panther Lake is H series only, HX will be based on Nova Lake.",Neutral
Intel,Yeah so it is weaker for gaming with a dGPU than the 0.2% of laptops currently sold that have either a 7945hx3d or 9955hx3d that makes up for less than 0.1% of all laptop users. What's your point?,Negative
Intel,"Yeah for sure. It's a small die and should be yielding pretty high. See also the number of 4+8+4 SKUs. Looks like the larger CPU tile is also yielding decently, so not a ton to cut down.  I'm partly saying that because a larger Intel3 die was certainly possible. Even if it was 6 Xe3 cores and built as half of the larger die (just one of the two render slices)  it would fill the void a bit more.",Neutral
Intel,Highly immersive porn on the go,Neutral
Intel,"Idk, FEM sim of a pressure boiler?",Neutral
Intel,"NVL-H is 400 series, *replacing* this, next year. Not supplementing this lineup.   Adding more cores won't do anything for gaming.",Negative
Intel,PTL extends up to the -H series too.,Neutral
Intel,These are H series chips. Even the U series chips don't go down to LNL min power levels.,Negative
Intel,> Source?   Common sense suffices. It's a tick core with a clock speed regression at that.,Neutral
Intel,"HX this year will still be Arrow Lake.   Nova Lake will be a full line up, with S, U, H, and HX, but end of 2026 / early 2027",Neutral
Intel,">Source??  You can't seriously be asking for a source for whether or not this part will be able to power dGPU gaming laptops better than X3D chips.   >Also Panther Lake is H series only, HX will be based on Nova Lake.  Not till late next year or early 2027. It's all arrow lake till then.",Negative
Intel,"Surely a cost decision. The 4Xe die, including the choice of Intel 3, is supposed to be the cheapest thing to deliver an acceptable mainstream PC experience. They need PTL to be a proper volume runner and start displacing the RPL that's still a large chunk of sales. WLC should hopefully finish the job.",Neutral
Intel,Just get a Vision Pro?,Neutral
Intel,"Tbh, more cores would just make that go faster, but 16 would already be plenty. Especially for something like that where it's probably going to be a linear analysis and ram constrained if they actually modelled the gas (which would not necessarily be required).",Neutral
Intel,Lmao this is funny we both responded to the same comments with the same things within like 2 minutes of each other.,Positive
Intel,I don't see anything wrong with asking for actual benchmark information especially when there isn't anything official. X3D is nice but it isn't the end all be all. I would be curious to see if Intel can manage to compete.,Neutral
Intel,"Oh I totally agree, but it would've been nice you know? Jumping to 6 Xe3 is a  significant area increase for a tiny tile. I understand exactly why the 4-10 gap exists, but I can't say I don't wish there was something to fill that gap if only because it looks weird.  I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.",Neutral
Intel,"PTL's main changes are fixing MTL/ARL's terrible SoC design, which should net a few % performance. It'll see a mild IPC increase, getting a few more % performance. And it'll lose a bit of clockspeed, erasing most of those gains.  Expect PTL to be very similar performance to ARL, but with lower power consumption, a much better iGPU, and most importantly to Intel: Using their own fabs instead of TSMC.  It absolutely won't be X3D in gaming.  Edit: Actually shocked that people think this would compete with X3D.  9955HX3D is \~16% faster than a 275HX in gaming...and a 275HX itself is easily 10%+ faster than a 285H in gaming.  Not even Intel themselves are claiming this. Their own marketing refers to PTL as ""ARL performance with LNL efficiency"". Nobody realistically expects PTL-H to see a 25%+ gaming improvement over ARL-H. The fact that IPC increase is less than 10% and clockspeed is slightly lower than ARL-H should make this obvious",Neutral
Intel,"Oh, yeah, I get you. Wish they could give more granularity. Just personally think some sacrifices are worthwhile if it can condense Intel's mobile lineup back down to something sane again.   > I expect the big CPU tile and small GPU tile pairing will find its way into a number of gaming laptops as the iGPU performance is pretty low on the priority list for those.  Yeah, should be a good fit. Shame they don't have anything with a bit more CPU umph, though. 4+8+4 and only up to 5.1GHz is *fine*, but not great. Especially without an HX replacement.",Neutral
Intel,"Given how well ARL HX was received in gaming laptops, I think they may wait to have something from NVL take that top spot. 5.1ghz does seem low though. ARL-H will happily do 5.4 and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP.  I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though they do seem reasonable.",Neutral
Intel,"Honestly, surprised ARL-HX is doing as ok as it is. The deficits of the architecture in gaming are well known. If it could hit the same clocks and core counts, PTL should look a lot better still. And all that besides, ARL's cost structure is horrible. For Intel's own sake, the sooner they move on, the better.   > and 18A should clock decently, though I suppose that's a sacrifice for the 25W TDP  From the same leaker, these chips are at 65W or even 80W TDPs, so they're not merely power limited. It seems that 18A just significantly underperform some expectations, though in line with some rumors and the gist of the revisions Intel's been making to its projections over the last year or two.  > I suspect these may not be totally final clocks though  If they're defining SKUs and such, these clocks need to be finalized for all practical purposes.",Negative
Intel,"If I'm reading correctly those are max power limits, not the TDP,  though I get what you mean. The 285H sits at a 45W TDP and tops out at 115W. Cutting 35-50W from that has to come from somewhere.  As for why ARL HX is doing well in gaming laptops, I think a good bit of that is also part of what made it lackluster on desktop. It doesn't really scale up that well with higher TDPs and power limits, but it does seem to scale down. The 285HX with its 55W TDP and 160W max limit doesn't perform far off the 125W TDP and 250W max of the 285K.  It also offers much better battery life than AMD's offerings in that space. I credit this to the lower interconnect losses in something like Arrow Lake than with Fire Range's chiplet system. The 9955HX3D is very impressive, but quite a lot of laptop buyers seem to value the ability to do more laptop-like things with their gaming laptops than the extra frame rate. I'm hoping this gets shaken up as AMD adopts new packaging tech as seen in Strix Halo.",Neutral
Intel,Try the shunt mod,Neutral
Intel,"Cool, errr...  icy",Positive
Intel,"I used to work in an inter chip testing lab in Ronler Acres Beaverton. We would test them in an oven, test them at room temp, and test the chips with liquid nitrogen. Cold had the highest failure rate, hot had the highest success rate.  Chips are designed to love heat.",Neutral

Intel,So do you have outlets in Australia where you can buy Maxsun Gpus?  Does Maxsun have an outlet in Australia where you can RMA to?  I am in the US and I want to look into getting the dual Arc card with 48gb of vram.,Neutral
Intel,"Okay, household freezers get to -18C. Water freezes at 0C, antifreeze freezes at about -25C. So, car coolant in a freezer will get to and hold -18C while staying liquid. So, that's how I did it.",Neutral
Intel,Oh! You put the car coolant to run through a freezer? Wow! Nice,Positive

Like for like on TDP, this would be a solid improvement given the GPU both has to be moved off-tile compared to Lunar Lake, and has twice as many CPU cores to fight for power.

Intel,"e cores are surprisingly powerful now, and games are getting more multithreaded. It might be better to spread them out over 8 less power hungry cores than 4 P cores and then spill over to the slower cores. Especially in a laptop environment where efficiency matters and the GPU is usually holding back gaming performance so much that CPU performance is really not that important.  In fact, I bet it's mostly down to not spilling over to e cores from P cores. That's what causes slowdowns and stutters usually attributed to e cores. The engine has to wait a little longer for workloads assigned to e cores than to P cores. The if the main thread is assigned to a P core that's all well and good, but if sub tasks are distributed among the P cores and then something important is assigned to a slower e core it holds up the sub tasks and in turn the main thread. But most importantly, it doesn't do so evenly. Maybe you don't need something assigned to e cores, or the e core task is light and doesn't hold up the other threads. Then things will run at the pace of the P cores, but every now and then you'll have a slowdown.",Neutral

Intel,"Shouldn't be. That's what the math has always said.  As soon as software can scale to ""many"" cores, the tradeoffs that go into single powerful P style cores are a bad deal.

Gaming benchmarks tend to have a really strong feedback loop that favors last gen hardware design though.

Yeah 9950X should outperform it technically I guess but the split L3 between two CCDs probably holds back the advantage of having more cores.  Yeah sadly there's no benchmark for Bannerlord. But supposedly it does disperse its tasks to plenty of threads.   Here's some benchmarks showing core and thread usage in a few games. While the benchmark tool doesn't get into the details of how those software behave obviously, but at least according to the graphs some games like Tarkov really suck at distributing its tasks to several cores but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.

Intel,">12900K being that high in the Starfield benchmark  It's because Creation Engine 2 worked better with Intel hardware until AM5 X3D chips, and 12900K great result in this test just shows that it's still a good CPU with 8 Performance cores, not that it's core count matters in any significant way - for example, 7700X delivers identical performance with lower core count/threads.  >lower clock speed than even 7700X  Clock speeds can't be compared between different architectures, different architecture = different efficiency, what matters is IPC.  >shows that the game benefits from more cores and threads very much  [here's a better example where more intel CPUs are present in Starfield test](https://youtu.be/XXLY8kEdR1c?t=29m5s), as you can see, increased core count/threads past 8 performance cores and 16 thread's is meaningless and won't provide any noticeable performance improvements, 6 faster P-cores on Intel 14600K provided better result than slower 8 P-cores on 12900K.   Going from 7950X to to 7700X results in 5 FPS loss, which is like 2-3% less FPS, and it's mostly because of lower clock speed(5.7Ghz Vs 5.4Ghz boost).   >but some others like Starfield, Cyberpunk, and Space Marine 2 are actually quite good at it.  That's the point, I agree that modern games can and will utilize 8c/16t configuration, but so far I don't see a trend of games becoming more ""multi-threaded"" past that point, as I replied to that person, I'm curious what games now become more multi-threaded than few years ago, I find that observation speculative and without evidence - more cores and threads is a great approach for workloads, but games generally don't care about it past a certain point, in this case it's 8c/16t.  It could change with next-gen consoles, if they will use AMD 12 core CCDs and games will be optimized to utilize more cores&threads.  What's important now is good cores or good cores+X3D cache, not core count - even 7600X3D with 6 cores and 12 threads is better in gaming than most Intel/AMD non-X3D CPUs with way more cores.  Edit: typo",Positive

Same with Starfield.   That's because in video games, core count matters less than how fast the CPU can access or manipulate very dynamic types of data in a random memory address.    X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"". They're going to win in old or new games, and they're winning in games because they have a large buffer of low latency data. Not winning in productivity benchmarks because productivity is about processing matters more than accessing data, and its more easily multithreaded too in many cases.    But having more cores is still more advantageous in software and games that can occupy them.",Neutral
Intel,">Well you said that games are optimized for 8/16 and yet gn bench shows 7600X only gets 3-4 less avg fps than 7700X  I said ""can and will"" not that every game is going to benefit from it.  Point of discussion was to prove that games are using more than 16 threads or they're not - it seems like you overestimated Starfield, UE5 reliance on core count/threads and most games care about 16 threads at most.   >core count matters less  Yes, that's why I replied to that person and asked him to provide me with modern AAA games which are more ""multi-threaded"" now than AAA games a few years ago, I feel like what he ""observes"" is what he wants to believe, and not something that actually happened with optimization in games.  >X3Ds are not just ""whats important now"".  AMD sells 9950X3D, best productivity and gaming CPU, if you really need both(workloads/gaming) it's the optimal way, for an average user, only benefit of E-cores is lower power draw when idle - but they do matter more if you need those workloads, I agree, but we discussed gaming performance and core reliance.",Neutral

It's not like we have to guess what is what is big and what is coming. We know and what's coming is more AI and more graphical experiences.

Intel,Yes,Neutral
Intel,"For them to do a 'big iGPU' design they would need to do a few things:  1. Use a different socket.  The iGPU will get too big for the existing one.  2. Upgrade the memory bus to 256bit.  That uses some power and silicon.  3. Add cache to the chip for the iGPU to use (to make up for the poor bandwidth they get from LPDDR5, even with a wider bus)  If they don't do this then the chip (which again won't fit in their default socket) will be massively bandwidth constrained to the degree that it's pointless.  Basically, do all the stuff that Strix Halo did.  Issue is Strix Halo didn't sell very well, the idea is a proof of concept and the concept needs faster memory to really work well.  LPDDR6 might help a lot at getting these big chip ideas from a XX60 level to a XX70 level, but they still require a lot of expensive chip work and a new motherboard design custom to the big socket.  I suspect we'll get there eventually, but it'll be a few years before people start calling it quits on dGPUs.",Neutral

The next big jump is LPDDR6 which looks to potentially hit a 50% bandwidth increase and marginally lower latency.

Intel,The problem is still here. 9060 xt with 5600 is faster than B580 with 9800x3d and B580 still loses 8% with 5600 instead of 9800x3d. Which means that cpu bottleneck starts much sooner for ARC gpu.,Negative
Intel,"Is this related to historically Intel compiler not compiling code efficiently for AMD cpus? Does it also make Intel CPUs overhead better? If yes, then they really fixed something. If no, then they wrote code normally for AMD cpus as well as Intel cpus.",Neutral

Intel,Exactly. Its nice that some games were fixed but between that and calling the issue (entirely) fixed there is a big gap.,Negative
Intel,"Indeed and it is something very interesting, because the reason the driver overhead is an issue on 6 core cpu's is because modern games use all 6 cores, so if the driver has a big overhead the CPU has nu free cores available for the driver.  Especially Intel CPU's with more (e-)cores in their budget CPU's should probably suffer a lot less.   I would expect an i5-12400 to suffer the same as a Ryzen 5 5600,  But an i5-13400/14400 has an additional 4-e cores to deal with the overhead. The 13500/14600 even has 8 e cores.      I would very much like to see the comparison   i5-12400, i5-13400, i5-13500, Ryzen 5 5600(X)",Positive
Intel,Would not have mattered. the cpu bottleneck in the intel driver is single-thread limited and largely due to draw-calls being stored in system memory as a buffer for the frametime render. (at least as far as my debugging could lead me)  (that's also why its less impacted on ddr5 systems no matter what CPU),Negative
Intel,"They pushed the 6 core parts too hard as ""good budget parts"" for too long to not keep using them as their reference...  Even when we're seeing games that now have strokes when they don't have 8 cores to play with.",Negative
Intel,"possibly. Honestly weird as hell to not through in intel cpu results with the same gpus so they can see if it's a all cpu overhead issue, or an issue with amd cpus with intel gpu. Like even one game if intel/amd gave about the same performance you could likely rule it out somewhat.  Also weird to say they fixed it if by the sounds of it to say it's fixed if a very limited number of games were updated to work better in also seemingly limited scenarios. That's more like finding a specific problem on a specific game they were able to improve rather than an underlying fix which if implemented should help everywhere.",Negative

Intel,The fact that a switch from a 5600 to a 5700 with hardly a frequency gain eliminates the overhead issue suggest that is kind of  how games/drivers work.,Neutral
Intel,Which also fixed performance on 5600X,Neutral
Intel,"But that's now how games utilize CPU's.  What you get from games is usually 1 main thread that takes up one big core, then many less intense threads, that may or *may not* utilize the other cores, and to varying degrees.

AMD,"Ya know the more i think about this the more pissed off I guess.  PC gaming has become increasingly unaffordable in recent years. I'm one of those old school ""60"" buyers. ya know, $200-300 for a GPU, and I plan to use it for around 4-6 years.   Since around 2018, we've been getting squeezed. First it was ray tracing and all that AI upscaling crap. Nvidia decided to make the 2060 $350 and threw anyone under that under the bus. Yeah, the 16 series existed, but let's face it, those cards aged like milk too.   Then COVID happened, the price inflation happened, and I was stuck on a 1060 through the pandemic. It lasted me well, but I knew it was aging, and quite frankly, GPU manufacturers stopped giving a crap about us. THey gave us the 3060 for $330, which was a joke. And this was before the ""inflation"" all the yuppie tech bros on these subs use to justify ridiculous prices.   I managed to hold it together through COVID, and upgraded during the price crash in 2022-2023. AMD was hit first, the RX 6600 type cards could double my 1060's performance for under $300, while Nvidia was STILL charging $340 for the 3060. It was a joke. Nvidia didn't get it, I dodn't wanna pay over $300 for a fricking GPU so I bought a 6650 XT for $230. It was an amazing deal at the time.  When the 7000 series launched around then, and the rest of the series was rolled out into 2023, honestly, it offered a very poor value for the most part. RDNA2 cards were literally sold next to RDNA3 ones for most of RDNA3's lifespan. And quite frankly, there was often little reason to buyt RDNA3, it was more expensive, and offered little in price/performance over RDNA2.  RDNA2 was eventually phased out in the higher price classes, but for a while, the RX 6800 was sold along side the 7700 XT, the 6650 XT was sold next to the 7600, the 6700 XT/6750 XT were in their own niche that AMD never really replaced, and the 6600 remained supreme as the ultimate budget option, competing with the fricking RTX 3050 and thrashing it in value.  heck, I was recommending RX 6600s as recently as this year, and really only stopped when we FINALLY saw the market move with stuff like the RTX 5050 for $250, the RX 9060 XT 8 GB for $270, and the RTX 5060 for $300. Even then, what killed the RX 6600 more than anything was the fact that AMD just FINALLY phased it out of production a few months ago and it was no longer a cost effective recommendation.   And now, AMD pulls the rug from under RDNA2 users? This fast? Really?  I dont care if they axe RDNA1, the writing has been on the wall for RDNA1 for a while, no mesh shaders, RT, DX12 ultimate support, yeah, RDNA1 is done. But RDNA2 is still a viable architecture. Maybe it doesnt support the fancy AI bull#### for FSR4 or whatever. Do you know how much I care? Not at all. Im in a budget class where I dont care if I get the fanciest graphics. I just wanna RUN THE GAMES. And to do that, i need DRIVERS. There's no reason they can just make the games run FSR2/3 and allow older users to use that. Sure, maybe it will be blurrier, I admit FSR is an inferior upscaler, but it works, and again, I'd rather run a game with a little blur going on than not at all.   To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time. Thanks a lot AMD. And oh, guess what, given that Nvidia is no longer charging like 50% more than AMD for the same class of product, I'm probably not gonna go AMD next time. Not if this is how I'm treated as a consumer.  Ive always been like at least somewhat biased toward Nvidia/intel because it seems like every time I buy AMD I get burned for some reason. SOmetimes its lack of VRAM, poor driver support, support for some BS API, or just poor performance like on older AMD CPUs I've owned. But yeah, they're just kinda giving me flashbacks to the late 2000s/early 2010s again when they didnt support their products while nvidia did. And I'm kinda feeling burned right about now.

AMD,"Let us retrace our steps to the spirited online debates of 2019, when early RDNA faced off against early RTX.  Early RDNA was pronounced the rational choice for the discerning enthusiast: modestly cheaper, often quicker in traditional rendering, and crucially unencumbered by ""gimmicks"" such as dedicated RT silicon or tensor cores. Ray-tracing was dismissed as an overpriced marketing indulgence, and DLSS was confidently predicted to vanish within the year. The RX 5700XT in particular was held up as an example: less costly than the RTX 2070 Super, marginally faster in raster. And best of all it was destined for superior longevity because the ""silly"" RT/AI gimmicks would surely perish like HairWorks. FPS-per-dollar at the moment of purchase would remain eternal as the only relevant metric of which GPU to buy.  Eternity, it seems, endured roughly until Adrenalin 25.10.2. AMD has now consigned both RDNA1 and RDNA2 to maintenance-only purgatory, with the driver graveyard following soon. Which is baffling considering how many systems and different products use early RDNA hardware. Even the RX 6750GRE finds itself affected, a card launched in late 2023. Imagine the uproar had NVIDIA deprecated the RTX2000+3000 series so quickly.  The RX 5700XT, once lauded for its value, is now remembered mainly for its hardware/software headaches. And when compared to the competition it now also lags in image quality (confined to FSR2/TAA) and framerate (due to increasing presence of RT in games). On the used market it usually trades for almost half the price of an RTX 2070 Super, a card it was supposedly better than in 2019.  Meanwhile the entire RTX 2000 series continues to receive full driver support, the GTX1000 cards that launched in 2016 are only starting to lose full support now. Games grow ever more dependent on RT. DLSS has become the gold standard rendering method and arguably the main reason NVIDIA secured overwhelming market share dominance in the 2020s. And even a 2018 RTX card benefits from the latest revisions and updates for all the newest ""gimmicks.""  AMD's 2025 RDNA4 series with its focus on ""ML accelerators"" and beefy RT units? They're actually pretty good cards (the 9070XT is AMD's best card in years) but they're also a belated concession by AMD that NVIDIA’s RTX blueprint was, in fact, the correct one. And the passage of time now positions early RDNA as a temporary measure, a stopgap until AMD figures out how to get back in the fight.  It remains quietly amusing how utterly wrong the YouTubers and online forums have misread the future about five-six years ago. Architecture/features/support, as it turns out, matter more than raster parity at a 5-10% discount.",Neutral

AMD,"Here's my hot take on this and playing devil's advocate.      Everyone is freaking out over nothing.   They quite clearly say 'Bug fixes' and 'maintenance mode' in that response from AMD Germany.      You think nVidia does driver optimization for 2000 and 3000 series cards? fuck no.. Those cards are also in 'maintenance mode'   making sure the game works with the card and bug fix and security patch if needed.      I can see why people are upset, but I also see it as AMD being transparent. Their older cards are in 'maintenance mode' now, which means they are still supported, will still get bug fixes, will still work with your games, but if you want the best experience, buy a newer card.      Nvidia does exactly the same, they just haven't given it a name.      Fight me 😂",Negative
AMD,"Outrage is fun, but no.  AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs. These card are well understood by developers and game optimization is the ***developer's job*** not AMD's.  AMD might be involved in performance optimizations with new cards is when developers aren't familiar with them and new shaders (often based on old shaders) are found to not work well with very different architectures but that's not happening with cards designed in 2017.  There is no dropping of driver support. These are mature cards, known ISAs, they are already optimized for in current game engines.  If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it. If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  We went through this outage cycle when AMD [split the driver stack for Vega back in 2023](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/its-curtains-for-polaris-and-vega-as-amd-reduces-driver-support) and this really feels like a repeat.

AMD,"Another windows related problem I'm glad I got rid off. I don't understand why an OS with such high market share gets dumped on so often by every manufacturer.  AMD and Intel GPUs run on open source drivers on Linux. Even all Nvidia RTX (GTX 16xx too) are getting more love on Linux nowadays.  Features and general improvements are still coming for Vega which I ran until recently. The oldest supported AMD GPUs on Linux are from the HD79xx series (real, not rebranded chips) from around 2012-2013 if I remember.   By supported I meant useful for daily use and normal consumers.  Meaning that all GPUs stated in the video are still completely fine, same goes for the USB-C output of the RX79xx.  In my eyes that's all planned obsolescence which here is irrelevant because of open source drivers. The corporations but also hundreds of free developers take part in.

AMD,"> To not support the series with drivers, when this could render the GPU incompatible with new games is a DISGRACE. I bought my 6650 XT planning to use it until 2027, hoping that my next sub $300 GPU would offer twice the performance and more than 8 GB VRAM. I dont wanna upgrade now, spending $250-300 for 10-50% performance improvements (seriously, the 5050 is barely faster than the 6650 XT in raster) and 8 GB VRAM. I just dont. As such, I guess I'm gonna be stuck using an obsolete and no longer supported card for the mean time.  To be clear, AMD is still providing drivers -- they're just not providing new game-specific driver-level optimizations.  I'm not sure how much this actually matters for older cards, since engine support for RDNA 2 and earlier should be pretty dialed-in to the point where driver-level optimizations shouldn't be as necessary. Not supporting new Vulkan extensions could potentially be problematic, but I'm also not sure it matters if these extensions are meant to support hardware that RDNA 2 cards (and earlier) don't have.  [Vega and Polaris are also in this ""extended support"" phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/17qn9e3/amd_begins_polaris_and_vega_gpu_retirement/), and looking at the driver pages for a Vega and Polaris card (I chose the Radeon VII and the Radeon RX 480), their latest driver update was in August 2025, which isn't that long ago.

AMD,"Fine wine definitely was a thing back with the GCN architecture. Part of GPU drivers is bug fixes, but the whole game ready part is Nvidia/AMD optimizing games for the developer. Back with GCN the AMD architecture was a bit more complex and developers used it poorly. Developers did stupid things like tessellating concrete barriers and the surface of the water to hell and back. So over time you would have real gains and the AMD cards would have a better lifespan than their Nvidia counterparts. The RX 580 was phenomenal.  I would call the fine wine back in the day more shitty developers than shitty drivers.  Fine wine ended with RDNA, it was much simpler to optimize and all over the consoles. That means RX 5000 series going forward don't get those same bumps over time and we've seen it.  AMD fans repeating fine wine these days are talking about a golden age of Radeon that has long since ended without ever having experienced it themselves.  The better aging has been on the Nvidia side with things like DLSS squeezing more performance out of cards. Framegen is going to be a godsend for the 40-series and 50-series in 4-5 years.",Neutral

AMD's marketing is beyond embarrassing; they're simply pathetic. Robert Hallock was the only bright spot and he left in order to literally work for their biggest competitor.  You don't think she signs off on (or oversees) key business decisions like pricing, FSR, RT? What about the bumbling launch of Zen 5?

Then, after all that, the BEST they managed to do was copy Nvidia (-$50) by listing a fake MSRP, at least in the US, then lied about availability when claiming inventory issues were solely due to demand despite having warehouses full of cards for months from the delayed launch which was due to waiting for Nvidia pricing + selling ALL RDNA 3 inventory to milk RDNA 4 pricing (and not due to the expiring rebates they weren't going to provide retailers or the fact that AIBs would only sell models > $2-300 above MSRP).    Meanwhile, you didn't think it was fishy that  coincidentally they just so happened to conveniently fail to manufacture Reference cards for the first time since I can even remember, meaning that RDNA 3/2/1, Vega, and Polaris ALL had reference cards, so at min dating back at least > a decade)?",Negative

AMD,">AMD state they will maintain it for bugs which is all it needs.  That's not what they do. They freeze development by branching the code bases off. This effectively means they no longer do development on the legacy branch.   Even in theory fixing bugs in old unmaintained code is difficult because it stops looking like the cold you're working on on a  regular basis. But in practice they basically never fix bugs outside of the most severe and most basic. Crash fixes to extremely  basic desktop use.  But at a broader general level your statement is incorrect. GPU drivers need constant development because the targets for development constantly change.   A new Vulkan version is imminent (announced by Mesa devs very recently), and RDNA 1 and 2 cards won't get it even though they're fully capable. New DX versions are released  frequently as well, again same issue.  Game development changes and they start using these newer APIs, or they use existing but barely or never used features, triggering issues in drivers due to lack of testing. This happens quite frequently. These GPUs are only a few years old , some 5 years max.   >If a developer is optimizing for RDNA2 and finds a bug AMD will still fix it.   They won't. They don't do any of this in the legacy branch for Vega.  >If AMD wants a new feature to run on these cards they will optimize for it. If there is a new DX12 or Vulkan extension AMD will add it. If a downstream customer has a problem (think Steamdeck, consoles etc) AMD will address it.  They've never done this for the legacy Vega branch. It's stuck at exactly the Vulkan and DX API when they froze development, even though the hardware is far more capable and is fully Vulkan 1.4 compatible along with a long list of other extensions AMD never added.   On Linux the development is partially done by the community and Valve at the kernel level,  and at the usermode level (for Vulkan) it's entirely by the Mesa community and Valve, with no AMD involvement.   As you can guess the driver support on Linux is light-years ahead. Everything from newest rdna4 to GCN 1.0 is still fully supported and updated with constant Vulkan extensions and full scale development broadly at all levels of the driver stack.   Yes this applies to all sorts of GCN hardware because they're extremely capable still. You can do shader emulated ray tracing on Vega and RDNA1 with playable performance.on Linux.

Not like that is only a AMD thing either. Kepler aged poorly as DX11 took over, even on cards that weren't VRAM constrained.

Your solution is egregious because a thin minority will notice and spread the word regardless, just like a thin minority of people is doing benchmarks ...

AMD,I get this system wide system hang every now and then for no reason that I can find. I've read that it's due to multi-monitor perhaps but I'm not 100% sure all I know is that all the new drivers do it after 566.36. I updated a couple of days ago to see if it was fixed and it still did it.   It will do it a handful of times a day but it just gets very annoying when I'm trying to watch a film.,Negative
AMD,"Good to hear it is fixed, my issues were BSOD, freeze, display driver constantly crashing and restarting (many people report this as black screen etc, it's just the driver restarting) with the launch driver from the 5060 Ti, 572.something if I remember correctly. I just gave up in the end, I'm not averse to trying to fix things and could understand what was happening quite clearly but nothing seemed to help, going back to a 4000 series card on 566.36 fixed everything.  I assumed it would all be fixed eventually but the card was not usable while this was happening so I just returned it.",Negative

Very few youtubers or writers seemed to cover any of it.  I just returned the card and assumed they'd figure it all out eventually, then I would re-buy... now I'll probably wait until 2026.  I'm not sure it has anything to do with ""focus on AI"" or anything but it's definitely not the driver experience I was used to from Nvidia.",Negative
AMD,"I know and? They are still involved. I just wanted to point at the difference between proprietary platforms (that nowadays shit on their customers as a service) and open source ones. Them theoretically dropping their ""support"" within MESA has less impact than within the same situation on their Windows proprietary driver.  AMD abandoned their first proprietary driver of two (Amdvlk) in June on Linux for their Enterprise users. Amdgpu-Pro will soon follow. They are focusing on RADV now which is open source.  For example I reported an OpenGL bug 1.5 years ago on Vega and the first to take a look over it was someone working for AMD.  Official support drop on Windows: you're screwed on the first issue.  Official ""support"" drop on Linux (open source): If related GPU firmware is open enough, development might just slow down if at all.",Neutral

The Z2 Extreme that is in the Ally X is a major improvement to the Aerith chip in the Steam Deck and for $350 more than the 1TB OLED Steam Deck you are getting a performance boost, more ram, bigger battery, and better I/O in the form of two USB4 ports including one that meets the spec for Thunderbolt 4.

But if you install Windows on a Steam Deck just to play about 3 games which do not work in Linux, you have to ask yourself the question wouldn´t you be better off with another console which probably will get you more performance.

AMD,"Virtual Link runs 3.0 signals over pins that every other standard uses for 2.0, and is not reversible. Even if you could reasonably get that link negotiated and noise free over 5m lengths (a challenge that Valve publicly abandoned), you'd have a consumer cluster fuck of confusion as their standard USB C cables failed to work properly and looked identical.  Quotes from wiki:  > Unlike most alt-modes this remapped A7, A6, B6, B7 to carry a USB 3.0 signal, instead of the usual passive USB 2.0 signal. This means that one would not be able to extend the cable using a standard USB-C 3.0 cable, which has these pins mapped only for unshielded USB 2.0 signals. Also this required the VirtualLink port to also detect the correct orientation of the USB-C plug to ensure that the USB 3.0 TX and RX lanes are correctly connected.  > In VirtualLink mode, there were six high-speed lanes active in the USB-C connector and cable: four lanes transmit four DisplayPort HBR 3 video streams from the PC to the headset while two lanes implement a bidirectional USB 3.1 Gen 2 channel between the PC and the headset. Unlike the classic DisplayPort USB-C alternate mode, VirtualLink has no USB 2.0 channels active, instead providing a higher speed USB 3.1 Gen 2 (SuperSpeed+) over the same A6, A7, B7, B6 pins. VirtualLink also required the PC to provide 15 to 27 watts of power.  > To achieve six high-speed lanes over USB-C, VirtualLink required special cables that conformed to version 1.3 of the USB-C standard and used shielded differential pairs for both USB 2.0 pairs.",Negative
AMD,Maybe for longer cables? usually you don't get 5m long cabales for higher bit rate USB C standards (like 40gps and the new 80 one).

RDNA4 finally shows up, and the Youtubers in soyjak fashion all pointed and shouted ""AMD finally did it"" as if they should be praised for showing up to the race NV and Intel have been having for the last 2+ years, or if you get honest due to Intel's supply - NV has been solo running for 7+ years.  *EDIT: added a word for clarity",Neutral

Factor in NV even raised the price on the 2060S because AMD tried to release the 5070 XT at $450 [again targeting the 2070] - imagine what a $350 2060S would have done for RTX adoption and directly AMD's margins, AMD should be grateful NV is greedy.)  The RTX 20 series got a bad shake from the Youtubers and yes some of that blame is NV's fault. But by the time DLSS 2.0 rolled around, they should have reflected but rather then investigate these new features and realize their potential they stuck to metrics (I blame laziness - ""you expect us to bench what we do and upscalers too!"") they felt comfortable with and used that to basically mislead their audience through omission.

If you actually look at AMD's handling of the GPU division after dissolving ATI, this isn't surprising. At all. If anything, because RDNA4 is more on par with current Intel/NV offerings - it makes more sense.  The real black eye is that AMD continues to drip feed RDNA4 to users so it's not like users can openly embrace RDNA4 which would soften the sting.

Turing (2018) has dedicated RT/Tensor cores specifically designed for RT/DLSS, whereas RDNA3 (2022 - **4 YEARS LATER**) doesn't, and with that, I think I said it all.  In fact, I'm already sure RDNA 3 and even 4 will have the same faith, as UDNA/RDNA 5 will be a totally different architecture - which, by the way, will be literally a copy of Turing from a core perspective, which was released, once again, in 2018 -- 'Radiance Cores' are the ray-tracing cores, and 'Neural Arrays' are the tensor cores - obviously, much more powerful than Turing's, but you get the point - AMD is about 9 years behind nVIDIA in terms of architecture philosophy at this point.

AMD,"AMD must position themselves with the most positive consumer sentiment they can manage to counteract the frankly rabid and overwhelming sentiment Nvidia has managed to generate for themselves.

Next-gen performance uplifts are in many ways essentially given, and they will only matter to whoever can afford to buy it. The kind of person who can afford to buy a new AMD card can just as easily buy a competitively-priced Nvidia card, and can be easily swayed by sentiment when performance per dollar is comparable.  They're cutting the trust in their value proposition in order to save a little bit of money so they can redirect it to next-gen products whose overall sentiment is ""this still isn't as good as their competitor"".",Neutral

Couple percent uplift (up to around 12% or so from what I remember) every gen, nothing huge. Sandy bridge and ivy bridge could mostly hang with an i7 7700 if you got a good cooler and overclocked. Immediately after zen released, Intel went from the stance of ""why would you need more than 4 cores"" to the stance of ""now you can have cores, and single thread thread performance.""  Just for context, Sandy bridge and ivy bridge (gen 2 and 3 core) are largely the same ipc, just ivy bridge is a die shrink so its more power efficient. Comparing them to kaby lake (that last of the 4 core i7s) kaby lake is approximately 25-35% faster, depending on the specific models and benchmark, etc. This includes both ipc and frequency increases. I was running a 3770k overclocked at the time, and remember thinking that Skylake was the first gen even worth considering an upgrade for, then zen came out and changed the game.  We've really been spoiled the last 5-6 years or so. AMD went from lagging single thread performance by around 10%, but having vastly superior multi thread performance, to catching up on single thread with zen 2, then having a second 20%+ performance uplift in zen 3 over zen 2, and another increase of >10% with zen 4. Back in the pre zen days, I remember thinking that cpus in general had nearly hit their theoretical limit, since we hadn't seen a significant generational uplift since Sandy bridge over nehalem.  I guess it wasn't all bad though. You could get a gpu only a tier down from the top card for $300-400.

I wrote virtually the exact contrary of what you understood; If basically anyone else in the market \*seems\* to has it licensed rightfully, changes are quite high, that AMD has done so as well, especially and ever so more likely, when *AMD in particular* would be darn dependent of it for anything 3D-Cache.

AMD,Very much my thought,Neutral
AMD,"Network security is based on cryptography, which typically requires a secure random number generator.  While using RDSEED as the only source of randomness would be foolish, programs doing that for setting up encrypted communication would have compromised network security.  There are real world examples of flawed random number generators being exploited in various ways, not even necessarily involving networking, like breaking gambling odds by recovering the seed of the PRNG, and using that to predict the next step of the game.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but the attack only really applied to embedded linux, on devices like OpenWRT routers that lacked any sources of entropy. Such as user input or mechanical hard drives (Even modern SSD can provide some entropy, as long as there are writes)  The entropy degraded to essentially just the timestamp at boot, and it because possible to crack it.  Anything more complicated than a router is ""probably fine"" without a hardware RNG source.   Anyway, this issue only happened when something hammered RDSEED too hard. As long as RDSEED succeeded at least once since boot, and that was merged into the entropy pool, then there will be more than enough entropy.",Negative
AMD,"That's because mathematicians are notoriously bad in programming, and nobody else seems to understand the implementation. They're also convinced things like loop unrolling should not be left to the compiler and should be done manually. I don't know enough about it to say they're wrong, but it results in atrocious code bases.",Negative
AMD,Is calling rdseed32 twice and combing the answer unsound? Aside from it just being not as efficient as simply calling rdseed64 once. Does that make the resulting number less random?,Negative
AMD,"Eh, it's not that; most of the crypto code programmers I've dealt with have been solid software engineers.  It's just that there's a ton of concerns that don't always apply to non crypto code.  For instance you bring up loops, but those should be handled with very explicit intent in crypto code, otherwise it's very easy for a timing attack to occur.",Neutral
AMD,"Security wise it's probably fine, just unnecessarily complicated and inefficient since AFAIR each rdseed/rdrand costs in the order of a thousand cycles.",Neutral
AMD,"Yeah, it is indeed inefficient.  If I were to guess, it's done that way so that the same code gives you a 64-bit rdseed in both 32-bit and 64-bit modes (you can't use 64-bit operands in the 32-bit mode, so you have to use two calls to rdseed to compensate), though it would indeed be more efficient to write separate per-platform code paths.",Neutral
AMD,"No, AMD did not reverse course to my understanding. The new blog statement as far I can parse is just same thing as previously, this time worded by someone vaguely competent.  Disappointing from HUB.  Game support sounds great, until you realize it can mean whatever AMD wants it to mean. Game runs after launch? Game support! Basically same thing as market needs, reduced support but this time with nicer phrasing.  So no more RDNA2 game optimization, unlikely inclusion of INT8 FSR4 in the driver for RDNA2 since the statement excludes new features, FSR4 version that runs even on Windows with driver version 23.9.1 via Optiscaler. Compared to the GTX 1000 series nominally having game optimizations up until this October, and RTX 2000 series having received DLSS4? The end result is inferior support by a company that has a weaker product and market position.    This is less impactful to me than some others, as I am moving over to Linux as much as possible as the Windows 10 ESU period winds down, but 2020 products that are as popular as RDNA2 do not belong in a maintenance/legacy branch in 2025 let alone 2025 products.  I can only assume that AMD is slowly exiting consumer GPU space at this point? Otherwise they need to do some heavy handed trimming in their Radeon division leadership.

Turing (2018) has dedicated RT/Tensor cores specifically designed for RT/DLSS, whereas RDNA3 (2022 - **4 YEARS LATER**) doesn't, and with that, I think I said it all.  In fact, I'm already sure RDNA 3 and even 4 will have the same faith, as UDNA/RDNA 5 will be a totally different architecture - which, by the way, will be literally a copy of Turing from a core perspective, which was released, once again, in 2018 -- 'Radiance Cores' are the ray-tracing cores, and 'Neural Arrays' are the tensor cores - obviously, much more powerful than Turing's, but you get the point - AMD is about 9 years behind nVIDIA in terms of architecture philosophy at this point.  So do not act surprised that 5700 XT didn't have more value compared to 2070S at 100$ more as some of people thought, there's a reason ""nVIDIA -50$"" doesn't work anymore, those 50$ will bite you in your ass next time and people have woken up.",Negative

And the recent driver release only adds `VK_KHR_shader_untyped_pointers` for RDNA3+, despite this being a quality of life extension that all hardware can support.  This means either graphics programmers have to plan around the RNDA2 drivers for the next 3 years and not require anything new, or they only support RDNA3+. Both are bad, and this is only caused by AMD wanting to save money in the wrong place.",Negative

I would have thought though with what we've got them to confirm at this point we would have enough to keep them in check, which is what we plan on doing.  On that note AMD has confirmed to us in writing that game optimizations for RDNA1-2 will be rolled out at the same time as RDNA3-4.  ""Yes, game optimizations and support for all RDNA Series 1 through 4 will roll out at the same time in both driver packages – including but not limited to CoD, Crimson Desert, and Resident Evil."" <- AMD's words.

AMD,"AMD is splitting up the driver branches because RDNA 1 and 2 were not AI focused and lack dedicated hardware for newer, more AI focused/efficient data sets. With the move toward AI and features that require AI/similar data sets, it makes perfect sense to split the driver branches, separating RDNA 1/2 from the rest. RDNA 3 will be next because it's limited in the data sets that it supports so by the time UDNA/RDNA 5 hits shelves or around the same lifespan that RDNA 4 has at this time, RDNA 3 very well could get some sort of separation as well.  AMD was just very clearly way behind the ball on the AI shift/boom. The same can be said about Nvidia and where their driver branches separate. GPUs with Tensor Cores are on one branch while GPUs without them are on another.  Also, the thing about 16MB BIOS was very true.  It's why updating the BIOS on older boards was one way, dropping support for older CPUs after doing so.  Only so much room on the BIOS and AM4 had an extremely long life span so they could not support all architectures at once.  X570 boards straight up didn't support Zen 1 at all when they released...only Zen+ and newer. Same with updating 300 series boards, dropped support for Summit Ridge all together after the update.",Neutral

We have products in the maintenance branch right now, we know exactly how AMDs ""support"" for them looked and looks like. It's certainly a lot closer to the original statement than the new, PR-weasel word-statement. Maintenance mode has always meant for AMD:  Zero new features, zero attempts to fix long standing bugs, and ""game optimization"" means: we might fix the odd, game breaking, crash bug, if the game is really, really popular (think Minecraft or Call of Duty levels).     Vega and Polaris have long standing blank screen issues with VRR and the driver release note recommendation to resolve this is to just turn it off.

AMD,"The problem with AMD is that their architectures are just the bare minimum in terms of featureset at the release date of their respective architectures  RDNA1 had no HW accelerated Raytracing, no machine learning accelerators, no DX12 Ultimate.  Turing (RTX 20 series) had these crucial features already back in 2018.  RDNA2 had HW RT and DX12U but it lacked machine learning acceleration. It's RT acceleration was far weaker than Turing.  RDNA3 improved the situation by adding ML accelerators, but they were still quite weak. Improved RT but still a bit weaker than Turing.  Only now with RDNA4 AMD is catching up. The RT acceleration overvall is now better than Turing, although it still doesn't accelerate BVH traversal in hardware, which RDNA5 will bring to the table, catching up to Nvidia's 2018 architecture. Machine learning accelerators are now useful.  RDNA5 will be a major milestone for AMD.",Negative

AMD,Lumping RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 together is AMDs biggest mistake. RDNA 2 was a huge leap in terms of features and is absolutely a solid architecture to last the remaining console generation.   The support cycle shouldn't simply be based on the number of years. Axing RDNA 1 is fine even though Turing is still supported because it's fallen really behind in features. That can happen when your architecture wasn't as future proof as the competitor.  But RDNA 2 suffers no such thing and there shouldn't be any talk of it getting left behind.,Neutral

They're shifting to quarterly security updates until October 2028 with them, there will be no more GRDs.  EDIT 2: For clarification since some people here apparently have no contextual awareness - I was backing up the previous poster. My point is that Nvidia's history of ongoing driver support is much longer than the ""over 5 years of the RTX 3000 series"" mentioned by them. It was over 11.5 years for Maxwell, and around 8 years for Volta.  I didn't even factor AMD into the statement, but doing so would paint them in a very poor light in this case, as they have moved cards they are ""currently still selling"" into a slower driver release branch.",Neutral
AMD,>Good driver support  This term is really flimsy. Some draw the line at long security and stability updates and hotfixes to breaking problems. Some dont. But I really dont bellieve both red and green team software testing and tweaking old gpus when they run fine on stable api stack. Like polaris rx580 on BF6? That dont have support for a while.

AMD,"> One of those is getting first class support, while one is already considered legacy. I'll give you better: RTX 30 also is first class  5 of the last 6 gameready drivers are focused on dlss4 support. In practice most optimizations are done on a feature support basis. The only reason ampere feels like it's getting priority support is because it's more ml capable and shares most of the latest feature set. That ain't the same for rdna1 and 2, even 3 is barely ml capable and is barely making it  Rather than blaming the driver you should be blaming the architectures for not bein more ml ready, but that's something ya already know when buying rdna older than 4. There's barely any significant optimizations to be had for a mature architecture like rdna2, you ain't gettin magic drivers that are gonna boost perf by 30%. All you're getting are drivers that fix critical problems like game launch failures, people just don't like to hear the truth because it makes them feel like ""second class"" when that has always been the case in practice  The only difference is that nvidia ain't coming out to tell you about it.

Furthermore, these cards are supported just as much as their Nvidia counterparts, don't believe the opposite. The cards that have reached driver maturity no longer need constant updates; shifting the focus to RDNA3 and RDNA4 does not mean abandoning the cards.

You will continue to get access to general driver support.  Though I'm not super informed about Linux vs Windows necessarily.  Just speaking generally.,Positive
AMD,"Y'all are (basically all, universally) confusing 'driver support' altogether with \*specific\* Day 1 game optimizations.  You'll still have 'driver support' in as far as having access to the latest drivers and other things that might be in them.",Neutral
AMD,People already did that when they dropped 10 YEARS OLD Pascal support,Negative
AMD,"You're literally responding to an article, on reddit, criticizing them",Negative
AMD,That's because reddit has nvidia gpus. How many here have amd gpus and how many of those are 5000 series owners?   That's not exactly a lot of people making noise vs popular nvidias older generations. Might be even why amd did this.,Neutral
AMD,Their fan base might as well be a cult. They got whole YouTube channels dedicated to this kind of nonsense.,Negative
AMD,"This has been common practice from Nvidia for ages.  lol   Nvidia is not putting effort into optimizing drivers specifically for older GPU's.  They pretty much always focus on their latest two generations.    Doesn't mean there wont still be occasional like 'feature support' things that still get updated, but we're talking specific Day 1 game optimizations.  Which usually contribute a very small boost to performance for certain games and not a whole lot else.",Negative
AMD,">Imagine if Nvidia did this for RTX 30 and RTX 20  They already have. just unannounced.   Edit: it seems people are fundamentally misunderstanding where going on here. AMD is NOT dropping support for 5 and 6000 series, they are just no longer including them in day 1 game driver releases. That's all.   Nvidia might still include older cards in those, but they didn't invest any resources into optimizing then for the game either, so it's pretty pointless.   Literally nothing has changed, except AMD made it clearer that you can skip day 1 drivers when you have a older card.",Neutral
AMD,"And?  Nvidia didn't stop supporting Maxwell till just now 2025, that's 11 years of support regardless of DX12U compatibility.",Neutral
AMD,It's not really an issue with 5070ti tbh. Just be sure it's fully in and forget about it.,Neutral
AMD,Resale value is really bad too for AMD GPUs.,Negative
AMD,This has been Nvidia's standard practice forever. lol  Nvidia is not building their Day 1 optimizations for anything but their latest two architectures.  Just cuz you still get access to the newest drivers doesn't mean you're benefiting from them with these optimizations.  My 1070 still has access to the latest drivers.  You really think Nvidia is putting effort into optimizing the newest games for Pascal GPU's? lol,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, as someone who bought a 3090 back in late 2020 and still happily using it, it is insane to think that the AMD equivalent from back then (6900XT) is moving to legacy driver support.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep, artificial obsolete at its finest.",Neutral
AMD,"If you know how to read, RDNA1 & 2 are still supported and will get future drivers.  Nvidia has really gaslighted people into believing that they need bi-weekly ""game-ready-drivers"".    You don't. The majority of the time they make no differences, usually they fix some bugs, and have been validated on the latest hyped AAA game release.   The included performance optimizations are often very insignificant, if they exist at all.",Neutral
AMD,"chill, lmao. overreacting drama queen",Neutral
AMD,Folks holy shit.  You are not losing access to the newest drivers.  You will still have that for years to come.   It's only the (usually fairly small) boosts for Day 1 game specific optimizations that will be limited to newer architectures.,Negative
AMD,Consoles have their own driver and software stack. So they are not effected.  What should be worrying is the steamdeck and the rdna2 based APUs,Neutral
AMD,"Both are rdna2.   And console games are always optimized for the hardware so this doesn't impact them. And Steamdeck is Linux which is probably exempt from this. But the z2a chip in the low end Xbox ally x is rdna2 which is a brand new product, so they're still selling rdna2.",Neutral
AMD,AMD never stated they are working on int4 FSR 4,Neutral
AMD,"No, AMD are freezing all driver development for RDNA 1 and 2. Literally nothing will be changed any more, so expect no new features, and new games to rarely to occasionally not work/crash.  It's been confirmed they're moving these GPUs to the legacy branch, and this is a literal branching of the development tree off, making any backporting of code much more difficult.l, and I highly suspect there will be none.  Legacy branch GPUs only get security exploit fixes, and the very rare crash fixes for extremely basic use cases.   For example the legacy Vega branch aside from security fixes got a few basic fixes to browser video decoding crashes, a Microsoft teams crash fix, I think a Photoshop crash fix and the one game they did a fix for was minecraft, which was a crash fix. That's it.  Alternatively AMD GPUs are still more or less fully supported all the way back to GCN 1.0 on Linux. It's better than nothing.",Negative
AMD,"Feature support like this can still be added.  They are talking purely about Day 1 game optimization stuff that comes with *specific game releases*.  Things that usually dont make a big difference anyways.  Everybody is fearmongering over this like crazy, not understanding a pretty basic and normal situation.",Negative
AMD,This is purely about Day 1 game optimizations.  It's basically all there in the article.,Neutral
AMD,"These optimizations usually only boost performance by a small amount, and with 'it depends' sorts of conditions based on settings and whatnot.    It's really not a big deal, but pretty much nobody here is understanding the situation.  They think AMD is cutting off general driver support, or that Nvidia has been doing anything different for the past 15+ years. lol",Negative
AMD,Much easier than trying to imagine being an Nvidia customer in 2025. I'm not sure how you sleep at night knowing what your dollars go towards. Objectively more anti-consumer.,Negative
AMD,That has nothing to do with not providing game ready driver,Negative
AMD,How are they fine wine when their older gen cards didn't get any new cool features like Nvidia and they just fell behind when things like RT and HDR became bigger for the gaming scene?  A 2080 can still use the RTX hdr and use the latest dlss versions while RDNA 1 is just dying.,Negative

AMD,Some games do not let you run the game without new drivers with them having a driver check at startup,Neutral
AMD,You are also talking about support of DX features as and when they come if hardware permits. Mesh shading was hardware supported in 2018 but needed drivers for when it actually came in a game,Neutral
AMD,"Your next gpu should be whichever one makes the most sense for you, whether it’s amd, nvidia, or intel.  Nvidia is worse than AMD imo.

AMD,"Nvidia literally do the exact same thing.  They drop driver support for anything more than two architectures old.

Nobody is talking about stripping away driver support completely.",Negative

AMD,"To be fair, they were mostly right with the 'RT' part, the DLSS on the other hand was and still is indeed a game changer.  I also hate when people said '5700 XT was better value than 2070S'. No, it just wasn't!",Neutral
AMD,i think it was the 2080 that performed about the same as a 1080ti but costed more than used or sales pricing of a 1080ti. pascal had huge oversupply issues and they didnt really clear out all those gpus till the 2nd crypto boom after the 30 series launched.,Negative

AMD,The 2070 got day 1 optimization for bl4 because it was the target of min specs and so did the 3080.,Neutral
AMD,yeah 30 and 20 series are on tier2 or tier3 support now. almost all the new features omit these 2 generations of cards since theyre 2+ generations old. at least AMD is upfront when they drop hardware down to tier2 support.,Neutral

AMD,Except both AMD and nvidia have been silently doing this exact same thing since they started making GPU's.,Negative
AMD,They have the same driver status as gtx 750ti. Whichh will also get some updates every now and then. Calling this gaslighting is hilarious to read,Neutral
AMD,I've had very bad experiences before with driver support from AMD in this regard. 2 years later after I bought a laptop they switched to legacy support... That just sucks mate.  I will believe what you say tho... Would hurt really bad to have a card that is unsupported as soon as I bought it...,Negative
AMD,They aren't really overreacting though....a GPU that's just hitting 4 years old and is still being utilized in current gen consoles shouldn't be shafted this soon. Considering the 6000 series was already scarce during the GPU mining craze.,Neutral
AMD,Dude... NVidia lasta with driver support much longer. Where the drama in that? Besides stating the next purchase because of lack of support is not making drama.  Cash grabbers get what they deserve.,Negative

AMD,"All they're saying is that older generation GPU's wont get specific Day 1 game optimizations, which only apply to the handful of specific games that get it.  That's it.  It's the same thing that Nvidia does.  All other general driver support will continue.  And it doesn't mean that feature support cant still be added for older GPU's if and when applicable.  You're having a laugh if you think anybody has been going around making driver optimizations for Polaris GPU's in the latest games for Day 1. lol",Neutral
AMD,"That has been my sense as well. For example just recently I updated my drivers for no other reason than it had been over a year. So from that I know my drivers are dated last fall and they dealt with two new games released moths later (stalker 2, poe 2) just fine.   Stalker 2 performance was perfectly in line with professional benchmarkers. It is heavy, but actually smooth compared to many complaining about stutters. In poe 2 I had no problems with the old drivers unlike some of my friends and a lot of the forum folks.  I'm assuming gaming optimizations mostly apply to multiple games with similar engines etc instead of just one game but I could be wrong on that.    That said I really hope they bring official fsr4 to rdna 2. Those cards are basically mostly for 1080 or 1440p and fsr 2/3 fails below 4k so they really could use it even if it isn't super well performing.",Positive

AMD,This is just wildly untrue.  The context here is specific Day 1 game optimizations.  Nvidia has only ever put any effort into this for their latest two architectures.  Just cuz you have access to the latest drivers does not mean you're getting any kind of game optimizations for them if you're using an older GPU.,Negative
AMD,"IMHO, the biggest practical downside of sticking with 1080Ti isn't lack of raytracing, but lack of modern upscaling. It's still a reasonably capable card, but lack of latest DLSS/FSR means it's effectively knocked a tier lower when compared to cards that do support it.

AMD,"wow, that's some peak incompetence from the devs. you'd think the game worked without extra hacks added to run it. well, it probably will if the check is bypassed though..  unless, of course, you are nvidia and you don't follow the spec to begin with, so you might have to do that.",Negative
AMD,Nvidia is a LOT better for long term support. Most customers don't care what they do with other companies if it doesn't affect them.,Negative
AMD,"I do agree with that, but the only reason I got 6800 at a time was a lack of VRAM on 3070 and 3080. 3080ti with 12gb was enough for my needs (VR), but was out of my price range. I do understand the shit Nvidia does, but from a customer perspective there ain't much difference if they ""downgrade"" a card with their shit naming scheme, if there is no competition.  I got fucked by AMD drivers once when buying a laptop with AMD GPU that got discontinued one year after release, but I let it pass. Don't think I'm going for it again.",Negative
AMD,"Plus the forced obsolescence with low VRAM GPU, they are all evil",Neutral
AMD,"What? No. Stop spreading lies. The 750ti was getting game ready drivers for 9 years. We only just got the GTX 1000/Pascal to stop having drivers recently this year and that took 9 years too. RDNA2 released after RTX 30 Series/Ampere and they’re already putting it into maintenance mode just shy of 5 years while Ampere is still going to get game ready drivers day 1, even RTX 20 Series is still getting day 1 game ready drivers and those cards are 7 years old",Negative

But yeah, If i still have that card today, the only thing I probably would regret from it is the limited 8GB Vram capacity it had, but that is easily solvable by turning down texture settings and using DLSS.

AMD,"I owned two HD6950s back when Crossfire was still a thing.  Those were supported for less than 5 years, so you could've very easily bought the card a few years in and gotten less than 48 months of active support.   Unfortunately nothing new for AMD.",Negative
AMD,"No, it's an understandable mistake. GCN2 and Vega were basically never supported by AMD properly and had very very early driver support end dates.   Polaris (RX 480/580/etc) and the original GCN (hd 7950/70/etc) series were bucking a trend of AMD not supporting gpus. These were the outliers for AMD if you look back historically.   It's understandable you took one of the very few successful AMD products and assumed that's how they operate, but that's just an understandable mistake.  Radeon HD 6000, 5000, 4000 were largely poorly supported in their days. It's been a consistent trend for AMD with only two outliers.",Negative
AMD,AMD has managed day 1 driver support with something? I guess believable with the 580 since it was a rehash of 480.,Neutral

AMD,"You realize the same argument can be made about the dude complaining about issues with AMD drivers, right?",Neutral
AMD,"well never had to update the driver for a game myself, at least in 20+ years. before that i had to downgrade my nvidia driver though, because only certain old versions were performant.  guess i just don't end up playing games from incompetent devs somehow..? tbh the whole ""game ready"" driver sounds like a marketing spin from nvidia or something. as opposed to ""our driver never worked, so we have to quick fix it now"" -driver.  or is this solely about the modern DSLL or whatever gimmicks, that would need support game-by-game?",Negative
AMD,And care to provide a source for this claim? Even if it doesnt come with optimizations some games would not let you launch without specific driver versions,Negative
AMD,"It's depressing that you're getting downvoted for this, just like me.   Folks here dont know what they're talking about.

AMD,"I want a better upscaler not a worse one, even if it's not a huge difference. The FP version is already as fast or faster on RDNA3 in Linux and much faster on RDNA4, so the only reason to keep developing the INT8 one is PS5 Pro and RDNA2 (which is pretty borderline for performance as an official product).    AMD should release a super light version for handhelds but I don't know if it will have that much in common with the leaked INT8 code or not.",Positive
AMD,"You're misunderstand what I'm saying, I'm not trying to conflate two cards. Just that ""Still being sold"" isn't really a useful statement about age, as you can find new stock of pretty much any card from the last 20 years if you look for them.  And honestly I think this entire thing is odd, ~~and the translated statement quoted in the top post seems to contradict other statements made from other AMD sources (namely the rep on the discord - I saw a screenshot of their comment I'm trying to find now to reference that said it was only *new feature* support that would be lacking from rdna1&2 - which likely makes sense as in the latest release that kicked off all this shenanigans the ""new features"" were primarily AI-specific ops that don't have hardware support on those devices).~~  EDIT: I still can't find the source, though I'm pretty sure I didn't imagine it, and the only AMD discord I could find doesn't even seem to have the user I remember from the screenshot (""AMD_Vik"" I think?). Though at the end of the day, a screenshot is just a screenshot, not evidence of anything :P  However on that (official) discord there was:  > ""We’d like to inform you that the release notes for AMD Software Adrenalin Edition 25.10 2 posted included misinformation that has since been corrected. There is no change to USB-C functionality on the RX 7900 series GPUs in the 25.10.2 driver. There was an incorrect line in the originally posted release notes that has been removed, and the release notes have been updated.""  Which kinda makes one of yesterday's big drama posts void?

AMD,Go do it and prove me wrong then. lol,Neutral
AMD,"No, D3D12 feature sets and/Vulkan extensions are introduced by newer driver versions, along with new Shader Models and shader compiler optimizations. This has nothing with “incompetent developers”, it’s nature of graphics programming.  And bugs within certain driver versions happen constantly, this is software just like anything else on the market, bugs are bound to happen.",Negative
AMD,"Driver notes for specific game day optimizations usually go over this.  I really thought this was like totally common knowledge by PC gamers paying attention to this stuff.  It's one of the reasons that if all else is roughly equal, buying a newer gen GPU over an older gen GPU is usually worth it.  Means about two more years of focused optimizations(not that this usually makes a huge difference anyways, but it's welcome).  Because Nvidia absolutely drops specific 'Day 1 game optimizations' support for older GPU's.    And again, nobody is talking about getting rid of \*access\* to newer drivers.  Only that specific Day 1 optimizations built within are optimized for newer architectures.  Which is exactly how Nvidia has worked for a long time.  Nobody is 'lying' here, y'all are just not understanding the situation.",Neutral
AMD,"because you dont need the extra hardware in blackwell and lovelace for framegen? just like how REBAR support could work on turing and volta GPUs with a firmware update but nvidia refused to do it because those cards were on tier2/3 support at the time, or how nvidia refused to add vesa adaptive sync support to maxwell when the hardware had displayport 1.2 support.  its a pattern of tier2/3 support for cards 2 generations or older. idk why people are convinced theyre still working hard on them. just because theyre in the same driver package doesnt mean anything.",Neutral
AMD,"This comment section has gone insane misunderstanding this situation.   It's wild.  You're like one of three other people who seems to understand this.    Nvidia doesn't support these Day 1 optimizations for older architectures, either.  It's the exact same practice from them since forever and yet so many comments are like ""This is why I buy Nvidia!"". lol Utter depressing hilarity.",Negative
AMD,Does it make a difference? Didn't I pay for support? I'm second class citizen? This is why companies treat us like dirt: we accept sub-par customer service.,Negative
AMD,Legitimately there's only two products that AMD supported long term:  HD 7000 series (and the rebranded R9 200 series which was just HD 7000 all over again)  RX 400/500 series   That's it. Entire history of the company.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, replied to wrong post ^^",Neutral
AMD,"no i mean this is very simple. if you use an old card for a new game, it will work. if it doesn't, the game dev is incompetent as they are throwing free revenue away.  it is primarily in the interest of the game devs for their game to work (well), and their job to make it happen. the only actual case where the consumer can expect an issue is if the card is just too weak (or extremely old so the dev won't bother).",Neutral
AMD,"Why are you here making up conspiracy theories about something that's well known and easy to check? Yes, you do need the hardware to run framegen, otherwise you lose more FPS than you'd gain.",Negative

AMD,You are STILL getting general driver support.    Y'all dont understand that going through every new major game and trying to tweak and optimize complicated driver code just to eek out some small percentage of extra performance is a ton of work.  And now multiply that effort for basically every generation of GPU architecture that you want to do this for.   This is why it's been standard practice from Nvidia forever to ALSO only focus their Day 1 game optimizations on their latest two generations.,Negative
AMD,"> Didn’t I pay for support?  Actually, no, you didn’t. You paid for a product with the assumption of support, which has been *marginally* reduced. And buying AMD shouldn’t come with any support assumptions given their poor track record.  Without an announcement you wouldn’t even have noticed, game-ready drivers are a nothing burger. AMD support has been an issue but *this* isn’t worth getting that upset over.  Edit: some of y’all find this so offensive that you leave comments that the mods have to remove. Take a chill pill",Negative
AMD,"Cool theory, the practice of working with graphics APIs and drivers is drastically different.  Even code that passes validation layers and is perfectly according to specs may not work on particular driver versions or not perform well. There’s a reason graphics vendors have teams dedicated to AAA games support.  And even old GPUs do receive new API extensions from time to time. You aren’t going to implement them without proper driver support.",Neutral
AMD,framegen on 30 and 20 series is a conspiracy now? so fsr3 and xess fg dont exist in your world then?,Negative
AMD,"With this mindset, we deserve sub-par support if none at all then. Amazing. This world is fucked.",Negative
AMD,yeah? then the non-AAA games still happen to work just by magic alone? and the dev is certainly unable to adjust the code themselves to work around bugs in the driver?,Negative

AMD,"> New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch.  This is the statement AMD gave to TH. TH is assuming this means day-zero updates and reporting as if that is factually the case.",Neutral
AMD,"This to me is just a fine example of corporate weasel wording. ""New features, bug fixes and game optimizations will continue to be delivered as required by market needs in the maintenance mode branch"" does not in any way mean that RDNA1 and RDNA2 cards will get game optimizations. AMD after all can simply deem that ""market needs"" do not include optimizations for ""insert popular game of the year number 2"" , only ""game number 1"" in 2026, and no games after that.   So no, unless they fully commit to providing game optimizations and full game driver support for an architecture that launched five years ago and is still being shipped in mobile and other products in 2025, I don't buy it. It's about trust, and lack of it.",Negative
AMD,Me when I shoot myself in the foot then realized I may have needed that foot,Neutral
AMD,"To be honest, dropping RDNA1 was fair, but RDNA2 was dumb.  There is a gaming handheld being sold **brand new, right now** that ships with RDNA2, the Xbox ROG Ally. Making a 2nd class citizen out of a device that just launched in late 2025 is just dumb AF.  AMD could have probably avoided this blowback if they were just more aggressive in their GPU strategy for their APUs. Like, there shouldn’t have been a new RDNA2 APU in 2025, full stop. Also, it doesn’t make sense for other modern APUs to still be RDNA3 or 3.5 this late in the hardware lifecycle. If AMD/Radeon were actually firing on all cylinders, RDNA4 APUs should have already released by now.",Negative

AMD,Well as long as the games work...,Neutral
AMD,"Okay to translate a bit to what this means: so....They're gonna make sure the games work, but again no optimizations. What does this mean? Well look at the typical amd ""fine wine"" arguments, amd often continues to optimize drivers for games while nvidia will still provide driver updates, but won't optimize for older architectures. That's why the gtx 600/700 series started lagging behind say, amd's 7000/200 series and the 900/1000 series started lagging behind the 400/500 series. Nvidia stopped specific optimizations for older cards while amd continued them. This meant amd cards often started performing better than older equivalent nvidia cards.  Amd won't be providing game level optimizations but will stlil provide driver support to ensure the games work.  To be fair nvidia probably does this too. I could see then optimizing for 4000/5000 series but whatever the 2000/3000 get they get. Nvidia tends to focus on their newest 1-2 architectures and whatever happens to the older ones happens. Doesn't mean nvidia stops providing driver support, they just won't get ""game optimizations."" You know what I'm saying?",Neutral
AMD,"Maybe ""market needs"" means ""Battlefield 6 runs perfectly fine, so stop bitching about your game-ready driver nonsense.  If a new game or windows change actually makes rdna1 crap out, we'll look into it because that's what maintenance mode has always meant.""",Negative
AMD,"AMD should just open source their GPU driver stack on Windows like they do on Linux, where support for oldish cards isn't a problem.",Neutral
AMD,"I guess they are planning on exiting the consumer GPU market then.  So that's a solid no buy for me for the next few years at least until they've proven that they support their products throughout their useful lifespan.  I have a 2070 max q laptop that's still well supported after a considerable amount of time, and a 6400 that I just bought for a sff build that is now unsupported.

AMD,"> They need to be more clear about what's actually happening.  I wonder if they got a call from Gabe.  Jokes aside, the Steamdeck trying to act like a console means that AMD really has to continue RDNA2 support for quite a long time.

AMD,It means they'll do shit unless the game crashes at launch and won't run at all.,Negative
AMD,It means they can do whatever they want with no consequences and the fans will eat it up.,Neutral
AMD,"They are really not.    I dont know what people think is going on here, but when Nvidia/AMD offer 'Day 1 Game optimizations', they are for specific major releases, where they take some extra effort to try and boost what performance they can from their end of things, via driver tweaks and optimizations.  It usually doesn't even amount to a whole lot, and often only for specific situations.   You do NOT need these 'Day 1 game optimizations' to run games properly.  They are basically a nice little perk.   And the point of only focusing on the latest architectures is that they can put more priority and effort into them, granting some presumably slightly better results in doing so.   It really is exactly what Nvidia have been doing forever.  Many people seem to not understand that just cuz they get access to the latest 'Game Ready Driver' or whatever does not mean there's anything in that driver that will benefit you if you're on a somewhat older generation GPU.  I'm still getting Nvidia driver updates for my GTX1070, but I'd be a fool to think Nvidia were actually still taking any effort to optimize things in the very latest games for Pascal GPU's! lol   It's absolutely insane how people are overreacting to this.",Negative
AMD,Most  people do not even know these drivers exists for their GPU's.,Neutral
AMD,"They are irrelevant unless a game has severe bugs.  Because Nvidia slapped a marketing term on it (""game ready"") people think hardware has to have updated drivers to support software.

AMD,AMD still updates the drivers for Vega. You guys just love to doom and gloom.,Negative
AMD,"Losing 5-10% performance is exactly the problem, given how heavy modern games are and how popular RDNA2 is. Sure, RDNA1 doesn't support DX12 ultimate and can't handle mesh shaders, maybe you can make an argument about moving that to maintenance branch. But RDNA2?   I could've begrudgingly accepted this sun-setting had it been done in October of 2027, when the RX6000 series would've turned seven years old. But two years after last RDNA2 dGPU launch? With RDNA2 powered APUs, devices and laptops being launched in 2025? With RDNA2 RX6600 being the most popular AMD card in Steam hardware survey?   Sorry, basic game driver support with AMD's track record regarding maintenance drivers is not enough for me as a consumer at this point in time, and I will absolutely hold it against a company that cuts support far sooner than the competition. AMD can afford to provide full game driver support for an architecture they are using in current products for another year or two.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah this is my take on it too. 6000 series will get normal driver support, just not the specific optimizations for games. Basically they took away the ""fine wine"" but still support the product generally, kinda like how nvidia does for older architectures.",Neutral
AMD,"I keep seeing AMD doing the hard work then somehow screwing up the last mile - often in communication (be it with consumers or other devs).  There are some simple uncontroversial facts - ""Newer hardware"" has more development focus than older hardware. Some feature work requires hardware support from more recent devices. This is true for every vendor, not really mentioned but generally understood, even if not consciously, by the community. Even if they had a million more skilled engineers eclipsing any possible competition, there would still be that bias in focus.  But then AMD keep shouting those facts in the absolute *worst* way possible, making it easy to dunk on them and get headlines, and any ""clarification"" just sounds like weaselly corporate backtracking.  It's super frustrating for someone who works in the industry (and even used to work on AMD drivers). And honestly, not just this ""marketing""-level communication - I have pretty big issues in other areas that may be less obvious to consumers, they seem to pay for the majority of the work, then spoiling everything in the last mile by doing something dumb like banning interaction with gamedevs not through a single small overworked team that you know will *never* get around to your request, even if it could save *significant* development time.  Maybe AMD just *really* don't want to be a consumer device company? And *really* want to sell IP to others who them productize? But that doesn't seem to match their strengths - it feels like they could do so much better with *so little* effort.",Negative
AMD,This is irrelevant to consoles.    Steam Deck is Linux.,Neutral
AMD,"Because RDNA 1 is older, nowhere near as widespread (RDNA 1 is only in the RX 5000 series, a fairly small generation, whilst RDNA 2 is in RX 6000, a big one, AND APUs, AND consoles!), and is missing key hardware features (namely mesh shaders and hardware RT) which means it’s aging pretty poorly.",Negative
AMD,"RDNA1 is old enough at this point, without support for DirectX 12 Ultimate.

AMD,"They at least pretend to care, and have for decades.   Even RTX 2000 series gets the latest DLSS upscaling. AMD legitimately leaked a FSR4 build that's compatible with RDNA2/3 yet pulled it like it never existed.  Also, 7% may sound small, but nVIDIA reported $130b revenue.

AMD,"A more favorable reading is that AMD has finally given in and accepted defeat by acknowledging that nvidia's path they started with Turing was the right and only way forward and they decided to abandon all their half-baked solutions so they can focus on the actually competitive product RDNA4.

AMD,"1070 is 9 years old, RDNA2 was refreshed 3 years ago, yes it's not necessary but still a slap in the face, especially considering the overwhelming feature gap between RDNA2 and RTX 30 series and even the older RTX 20 series which got partial support for DLSS 4.",Neutral

For example Polaris, RX 580 is still trade blows with GTX 1060, but some people afraid using 580 because its driver isn't updated frequently anymore compared to 1060.",Negative

AMD,"Not at all, as a printer either works or it doesn't, they each have their own driver, but they interact with windows in the same way, the same printer popup appears for formatting the print and vinfirming the size, whether it's portrait or landscape, etc.  Each game engine had different demands on the hardware that impact different architectures in different ways.  If it was as easy as you claim there would just be a standard driver for everything and it would automatically run great on everything.",Neutral
AMD,Why not expect the game developers actually doing that work and optimise their code for the target HW?,Neutral
AMD,"You're not 'losing' performance that you never had, though.  Another thing that's important to note here is that throughout a GPU generation's lifetime, vendors are constantly trying to improve *general* performance via drivers.  After 2-3 years, these optimizations are usually pretty mature, and thus there's simply much less juice to squeeze out of older architectures with any kind of game-specific optimizations.  As for holding this against AMD, again, this is Nvidia's standard practice for a long time.  It makes perfect sense to prioritize newer architectures in newer games where there's perhaps more juice to squeeze, and can maybe even learn and improve general driver gains as well.  Y'all are so stuck on your initial outrage-based reactions, you're obviously going to keep trying to argue this somehow, though.  Cant admit you're wrong on the internet!",Neutral
AMD,Yeah I aint super happy about this especially since 6000 series cards were offered next to 7000 series for most of their lifespan but at least it isn't cutting driver support entirely. I would agree 2027 is a more reasonable timeline to start sunsetting rdna2.,Negative
AMD,That 'Fine Wine' was always about having poor day 1 driver support really.  And also having forward thinking features that weren't well supported in their day.  And having plenty of memory. lol,Negative
AMD,"It’s pretty clear that AMD sees the enthusiast graphics card consumer as a test market for newer features they’ll later productize for console and other licensed products. It makes sense too - big orders at higher margins, and lower potential losses (no buybacks) if the end product doesn’t perform well.  Now that PS6 development is in full swing, it makes sense that they’re redirecting their dev resources toward the resources that will actually apply to that GPU.",Neutral
AMD,AMD of course have plenty of deficiencies compared to Nvidia in terms of software support.   But this example isn't one of them.  They're literally matching Nvidia's standard practice.,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah thanks I'm aware the PS5 doesn't run Windows.  What I'm saying is, this is a supported product in some sense, why drop support solely for Windows?  That's confusing.  Plus they probably have team members actively familiar with RDNA2, surely some of that knowledge is portable across operating systems from an institutional standpoint.  Obviously there is additional Windows specific work that will need to be done, which has a cost, but again probably still easier than if Windows was the only platform these chips were used in.",Neutral
AMD,"Point taken. I'm not sure why this would warrant throwing an entire gen under the bus like that, were the older gens the same ? Not sure.",Negative
AMD,"To me it would be the exact contrary especially on these days and ages ( let's not ignore the sad state of that market )  Nvidia can get away because they are leading.   Either way, people are very quick to accept how the news dropped while RDNA 1 having (stated) updates a month ago wasn't even an afterthought, I find it a bit bizarre.",Negative
AMD,Right.  Nvidia has always 'supported' Day 1 optimizations for their two most recent generations.  And that's it.  Exact same thing.    It would take insane amounts of human resources to optimize every game for every generation of GPU with very unique and game-specific Day 1 driver optimizations.  Of course they have to prioritize.    This probably isn't even a new practice for AMD.,Neutral
AMD,"No, you are making that up",Negative
AMD,"Maintenance means the driver is considered stable and will not receive updates introducing new functionality, instead maintaining the existing functionality and making fixes for any significant problems that happen in the future. If a new game comes out that is unplayable for a non-hardware issue then it would be the job of the remaining maintenance team to work on a fix. The rest of the people who used to work on developing the drivers for these cards are likely being moved so they can focus their efforts on improving newer cards.",Neutral
AMD,"That's a feature, not a Day 1 game-specific driver optimization.  It's very depressing that y'all dont understand the difference.  It shouldn't even need explaining.

Not sure I've ever seen a bigger example of making a mountain out of a molehill in the tech community.",Negative

It's baffling that they would admit to it. Sorry, I can't as a consumer give a billion dollar corporation the benefit of the doubt.  And AMD blindly copying Nvidia only in the negative sense is honestly one of the unstated problems I have with this.   Nvidia wasn't selling RTX3000 based gaming APUs en-masse to be used in devices 2025. AMD is doing that with RDNA2. It doesn't matter that the architecture is old, if you keep using it in products five years after launch, consumers will expect support reflecting that fact.   Meanwhile RTX 2000 series received DLSS4 upcaling support, a GPU series that launched in 2018. AMD leaked Int 8 FSR4 that can run on RDNA2 and RDNA3, which I've tested via third party tools. I rather doubt maintenance mode driver includes support for such improvements.  Bluntly, I expect better support from a company that is selling a less capable product with an inferior feature set, not worse support. If you only get as much game optimization as with Nvidia, supposedly, and no backwards porting of improvements then why on earth would any consumer even consider AMD in the GPU space at this point?   They have worse upscaler, worse game support, worse feature set (ray tracing, streaming, productivity) and worse resale value.   You are framing this as outrage, rather than this being the last straw. For me, it is very much the latter.",Negative
AMD,Well that and back in the gcn days amd seemed to iterate more and as a result supported their architectures for far longer.

And keep in mind everyone here is kinda excusing RDNA1 even tho RDNA1 is as old as Turing which is still fully supported, the point is that game optimization is frankly not all that big of a deal, but the fact Nvidia not only provides optimizations for a generation older than RDNA2 but also still giving them brand new cutting edge features really highlights how bad this is. RDNA 1 and 2 launched with a feature gap vs Nvidia that only widened over time and now they're giving up on them sooner too.       Did Polaris or Vega recieve any new features since they were put in maintenance mode like RDNA2 now?",Neutral
AMD,"I mean yeah, at this point I agree. But AMD doesn't need to say ""RDNA 1 and 2 is in maintenance mode"" if the cards is still supported in the first place.",Neutral
AMD,"They absolutely do, hence why sometimes when a game comes out, they will note known issues with said HW in that game in the release notes, they only know that because they have tested it.  Happens quite often.",Neutral
AMD,It's not a difficult task to do when the architecture is so well understood by the driver team,Neutral

AMD,People who want their windows to function properly instead of breaking basic systems then get outraged when something doesn't work.,Negative
AMD,"That's just stubbornness, nothing to do with being casual.",Negative
AMD,"Every game.  They will all have a benefit even if only slightly.   This is not the experience you absolute halfwit, there's not a standard windows driver that works on both vendors that automatically allows games to run great.  Gpus need their own drivers, and need optimisations within them for each new game and game engine for ultimate performance.",Negative
AMD,Not AMD's Linux drivers. They are open source and can even be contributed to if a developer finds a problem and makes a fix.,Neutral
AMD,"General driver support is going to continue, regardless of what it's called.    Again, y'all are really massively overestimating the importance and impact these 'Day 1 Game Optimizations' actually have.  That's the real argument here.  Nothing much is actually going to change for users on a practical level.   'backwards porting of improvements'  Any improvements that would be described as backported improvements will still benefit older GPU's.  You're still gonna have access to the same drivers.  Driver support isn't stopping, like some of y'all seem to think.   But most of the 'general' driver optimization improvements for older architectures have already been achieved.  There's just less juice to squeeze from these older GPU's, which is another reason it makes perfect sense to focus such Day 1 game-specific optimizations on newer architectures that dont have the same maturity of drivers.  Aka - more juice to squeeze.   But it sounds like you already had your mind made up about AMD GPU's, and so for you, this is just confirmation bias at work.  Anything to further help justify the judgement you've already made.   And to be clear, I'm an Nvidia owner.  Not an AMD/Radeon stan by any means.",Neutral
AMD,"Just the 3080?  Not all other Ampere parts, or any Turing parts, or Pascal parts?  Just the 3080?",Neutral
AMD,"It still gets driver support, and +50% vram is very useful, why do you think everybody avoids 8gb gpu's  Running out of vram is the worst thing that can happen as textures has no cost of performance if you have enough vram  But yeah I do agree Dlss 4 is a big + That's why they need to make it official that the 6000 and 7000 series will support fsr4",Negative

AMD,"After a few decades of it, we're lucky they have a pulse.",Negative
AMD,What game optimizations actually happened?,Neutral
AMD,"that interpretation doesn't match what they said  >  Future driver updates with specific game optimizations will focus on RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 GPUs.”  To me that sounds like, oooh, your 6950XT have less fps than the 7400 and 9050XT, tough cookies, buy a new one, you get no updates for you card unless it crash the game.",Negative
AMD,"""RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 graphics cards will continue to receive driver updates for critical security and bug fixes. To focus on optimizing and delivering new and improved technologies for the latest GPUs, AMD Software Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 is placing Radeon RX 5000 and RX 6000 series graphics cards (RDNA 1 and RDNA 2) into maintenance mode. Future driver updates with targeted game optimizations will focus on RDNA 3 and RDNA 4 GPUs.""  This is the same thing they did to the RX 480/580 a few years ago. No more optimizations. Just critical updates for stability or security. That's what ""maintenance mode"" meant last time.",Neutral
AMD,"They aren't false, they will be from more demanding scenarios obviously, but that's where the performance gain matters the most.",Neutral
AMD,This isn't about 'issues'.  It's about driver optimizations for slight performance boosts.  That's it.  AMD is not denying that they'd fix problems in major releases with older GPU's.  Of course they would.  They're not stupid.,Negative
AMD,"No man. lol  Most of the general driver optimizations for Pascal were matured a long time ago already.  Room for improvement would be minimal.  And even less than minimal when we're talking about modern releases that demand a number of features or pure grunt that Pascal literally doesn't support at all.  Again, I think you're very much not understanding what the role of these 'driver optimizations' are.  They are 'extra boosts' when possible, and even then, those boosts are often quite limited and/or situational.  Even if what you're saying was true, it would still be crazy to be hiring entire armies of software engineers working on every single unique generation of GPU of the last 5-10 years with each new major release, just for some smallish gains in some situations.  There's no world in which that would be that a justifiable use of resources.",Negative

AMD,Nothing's broken by debloating lol. Have fun with the shittiest version of windows that everyone hates.,Negative
AMD,"It still gets driver support “as required”. That’s very unspecific and worrisome.   Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate not being with 8GB VRAM.",Negative

AMD,"An air cooler is more than enough.  I myself am using a dual tower 120mm Air cooler.   Temps peak at 70c most of the time   And during summer or hot days, I never saw it go past 76c yet.  In either gaming or video editing",Positive
AMD,I have an air cooler on my 5700x and the temps are fine. It's a 65w TDP so it doesn't run very hot. I paired mine with a RTX 5700 12GB. You're going to to be really happy with this cpu/gpu combo!,Positive
AMD,"AIR. Water cooling is pointless unless you are heavily over locking the latest couple generations of the most expensive intel chips. Whenever I see a water cooled build all I can think is, “so you want to show off that you wasted money?”",Negative

AMD,"There isn't a consumer AMD cpu in the world that needs liquid cooling  Anyone convincing you otherwise is trying to sell you something, or is trying to justify their own purchase  35$ Phantom spirit se 120mm is pretty much the go to",Negative
AMD,"AIOs are not necessary for any CPU in a gaming context.  AIOs may be necessary if your build cannot physically fit a decent air cooler, like some small form factor PCs.  AIOs may also be good if you just like their look.  If you don't need one for SFF, and you don't want one for the look, then air cooling is better.",Neutral
AMD,"I see. AIO may be more aesthetic, but I'd rather get a much cheaper - and fitting - cooling system and save some money to make my build pretty with something else like one of those 5"" LCD case displays. Also not having to worry about the pump failing and destroying my graphics card, and just having to clean the fans every now and then feels much more relaxing. Thank you for your feedback, it really helps. Do you think it's safe to buy some components on Amazon ?

When you have a basic under desk computer with a glass panel, you can see cool rgb fans on the air cooler, but can't see them on the AIO! The angle makes it not happen.  AIO goes top of case, or front of case.   As for amazon, I'd trust them for a cooler. It's a hunk of metal with fans.  GPU CPU RAM? I'm a little cautious, I prefer microcenter.",Negative

AMD,"The 7800x3d is the better pick between those 2 cpus for mostly gaming, and can also handle those other tasks like streaming and multitasking no problem. The x3d v-cache is worth more than just $20, for that price difference its a bit of a no brainer.  For the parts you mentioned there really isn't any compatibility issues or bottleneck problems, the only thing I would say with AM5 is to make sure you get only 2 sticks of ram, Am5 can get unstable with 4 sticks and generally speaking you have to down-clock the ram speeds to get good stability.",Positive
AMD,"7800X3D  So long as you don't buy a really low end motherboard, you'll be fine. For memory, any 2x16gb 6000 CL30 kit would be ideal. 6000 CL36 is fine if 6000 CL30 is too expensive.",Positive

AMD,Yeha i will never like overlooking or ill turn the settings down or buy new parts,Neutral
AMD,Yeha that's why im get the x3d,Neutral
AMD,"The main reason you would hear some people say the 9700x would be you aren't gaming but still do have heavy multicore workloads like video editing, 3d modeling, CAD software ect.   For mostly gaming use cases the reality is anyone who says the 9700x is better than the 7800x3d is just flat out wrong.",Negative
AMD,Yeha the x3d is the best bet for me,Positive
AMD,"The 9600XT will likely be a bottleneck for the 7800X3D in a fair amount of cases. But that is actually the *situation that you want.*  Proper attitude about bottlenecks isn't about removing them (because realistically, they can't be. At SOME point, you WILL have a bottleneck in the machine). It's about managing them. You want the bottleneck to be appropriately sized for your needs, and placed where you want it (i.e. the performance disparity between a 9060 XT 16GB and a 7800X3D on a 1080p display is reasonably small, and you want the graphics card to be the limitation when possible).  Oh and because you didn't specify, I would make sure that this is the 16GB version of the 9060 XT.",Neutral
AMD,"Its a decent combo, I think the 7800x3d is a bit overkill for the 9060xt personally, but if you are playing E-sport titles and plan on pulling 200-300 FPS it can be a good match.   Generally, I would say to go with the 9600x and a 5070/9070 that should net a better gaming experience overall.",Positive

AMD,"1080 p ?      it's sufficient but nowadays 1440p monitors are cheap. And the GPU is kinda weak for that cpu.    If i were u, i would buy a 1440p monitor and buy a 9070xt.",Neutral
AMD,7600 + 5070/9070 is just going to be way better.    Also bite the bullet and upgrade to a 1440p monitor. They're like $150-200 for a good 1440p 180hz IPS panel,Positive

AMD,"The VRMs of this motherboard are overkill for the 9700X. If you do not plan to upgrade to a 150+ W CPU later, get the Gigabyte B850 Eagle WiFi6E instead.  All 6000-CL30 chips are made by SK Hynix, so the kit manufacturer does not really matter.  A 550 W PSU would be ideal. Anything more than 650 W is overkill and makes sense only if you plan to upgrade to a much more powerful (and expensive) GPU without upgrading the PSU at the same time.  Cheaper SSDs with DRAM cache would be the Kioxia Exceria Heatsink or Lexar NM800 Pro. (If the SSD already has a heatsink, consider replacing the Eagle with the Gigabyte B850 Gaming WiFi6.)",Neutral

Googling the 6500xt t5 legion model it has 8gb of RAM and a 5600g, which are all terrible components.  It needs at least 16gb of RAM to even play most games without being crashy and even then the best it's gonna handle is games like 8-10 years old at this point.",Negative
AMD,Is this a new problem or have you always had poor performance with this PC?,Negative
AMD,"While your system is pretty low end/weak, game performance will depend on the resolution and quality settings, and it should be able to play an 8 year old game like RDR2 at 1080p especially.

AMD,"Yep.  Running a Noctua U12S from years ago on a 200W 5900xt with an OC/UV. No issues.   However, case and fans are more important.  Air coolers need an  uninterrupted path of air. Modern fishtanks don't work right. And cases without proper airflow struggle. A shit case can work with a giant 360mm AIO. Not with an air cooler.",Neutral

AMD,My thermal right PA120 is doing a great job on my 9800x3d. Most of the time playing it sits at 60C and at 100 load it goes to about 70C range which it rarely does except when prerendering a game for example. I also have exceptionally bad airflow into my case.,Positive
AMD,Average air coolers are on par with average AIO's  Nowadays just comes down to what you want for your build aesthetically.,Neutral
AMD,"Fine as in “not thermal throttle”? If that’s the expectation most reputable brand’s dual tower air cooler will do.   However, AIO, especially 280/360, have significant advantages when it comes to noise to performance under sustained heavy load. If you don’t mind your PC sounds like a jetliner taking off, or you wear headphones anyway, you typically don’t need AIO.  But some of the thermalright 360 AIO are surprisingly price competitive even up against their own air cooler, can’t speak for its longevity but performance wise they are definitely worth considering.  Just avoid 120 AIO as they sometimes perform worse than air cooler, unless you are building a SFF build and short of space for air cooler.",Neutral
AMD,I switched from AIO to air cooling and got better temps on my 9800X3D by about 10°C. Very much can handle high end CPUs.    I had a Corsair 280mm Titan AIO and moving into new home with poor AC in the office caused hotter room ambient temps which resulted in higher CPU temps. I looked into and after some research landed on a ThermalRight Phantom Spirit EVO 120mm air cooler and plugged it in and immediately saw about 4°C cooler. After some fan curves adjustments I got it down to as much as 10°C than what I could get my AIO.    Noise is nearly the same with the new fan curves as my AIO was which is basically silent even under full load and only real difference I noticed was my AIO would regulate temps as it got hotter or cooler but took longer to cool down whereas the air cooler has more temp spikes but cools a lot faster.,Positive
AMD,"If you're gaming and it isnt a 4090 or 5090, just use the 9700X. Save money, and you'll never notice a difference. Even in non gaming, you'll probably never notice unless youre doing the high end stuff.",Positive
AMD,"Usually yes, 9000 series are pretty cool cpus",Positive
AMD,I mean sure you can make anything work but honestly a 360 AIO is just so much less headache and noise. Plus you never really have to worry about cooling and they tend to take up less room in the case all things considered.,Positive

AMD,"I think what else you have in the chassi matters more for water cooling of the CPU, than the CPU/motherboard itself. If you have something that has the traditional blower style of having both intake and outtake inside the chassi (like a modern GPU), then water cooling the CPU can make quite the difference for both the GPU and CPU.

I keep it set to stock 65W TDP (88W) with PBO.and undervolt, and temps are good under load (55C). I'm just surprised how hot it gets so fast at 105W TDP.

AMD,"I have an old gtx660ti 2 pipe heatsink and as an experiment I decided to hold a dual jet lighter against it (you know them lighters which make nice blue cones of flame).  The water from the combustion in the flames condenses onto the heat spreader about 5mm away from the edge of the flames. No amount of time holding them flames to the surface will cause the water to evaporate off again.  I can immediately take the flame off and put my hand to the point I'd been trying to heat for minutes and it does feel like it's warmer than air temperature but it's by no means ""warm"".   And that's without any fans on the heatsink.  Air coolers are just evaporation coolers really.  What matters is keep the air in your case cool. Which is why I have a positive pressure fine nylon mesh filtered 4 in, 1 out (to encourage exhaust out of the case on the peerless assassin 120 I use) mesh case. Dust finds it hard to get in, and it's easy to blow out, all the extra fans intaking make sure the case is always at room temperature and the exhaust encourages the airflow to go through the cooler even without the CPU fans.",Neutral

AMD,"Yeah, 7800X3Ds were extra efficient because they kinda had to be, since the thermal path from cores through the cache chips to get to the heat spreader and eventually the heatsink wasn't great, therefore had to run somewhat conservative clock speeds and voltages compared to the non-X3D 7xxx models (and was also locked so you couldn't even attempt overclocking). 9xxxX3D has better thermal contact from cores through to heatsink so can run higher speeds and therfore worse out of the box efficiency with the higher power, but it can get more performance out of it.",Neutral

I think it's just a matter of time until my motherboard kills my CPU :D I understand that you are going with 7800x3d, but there have been some reports of these CPUs dying in their boards as well.  You can opt for a Gigabyte board or an MSI board instead (B850 Tomahawk or a B850 Gaming Plus), and ensure that the primary PCI Express slot is Gen 5, not Gen 4.

AMD,I have the same question but for an RTX3090... Is there any point in looking for an upgrade right now?,Neutral
AMD,"Since power efficiency is a big concern for you, I might actually pitch to you the normal 9070, you can get them for around ~500 (got mine for 510 after tax), and it undervolts and over clocks amazingly and routinely has some of the best power efficiency across the board for GPU's, and depending on if you really want to squeeze performance out you could even BIOS upgrade it to the 9070 XT to see what performance gain it squeezes out.  Contradicting myself, but the 9070 XT has been selling at MSRP recently so that ~599 price tag for it does make it attractive, and you can just undervolt and set a negative power limit on it to make it insanely power efficient which would make it the better purchase potentially.  Money aside, the 5070 TI is probably the safest bet for you, but if you'd rather save some money and get bang for buck long term, then 9070 is a solid sleeper contender, especially if you are thinking of going Linux (which I highly recommend if you aren't locked into windows for a work program).",Positive

There's been truly, truly terrible performance jumps since the 3xxx cards. It all been less power and software bumps. The raw power of Nvidia cards has been marginal at best.   The 5080 would be the performance bump if you want that but again, the base 5070 is the way to go **BUT** hold off just yet. The Super cards are coming and you will be able to get the efficuency of the 5070 with the Vram of the 5070ti.   Hold, soldier.",Neutral

AMD,Ngl temps were never a problem on my 3080 but the power draw difference is really massive. I drop at least 100W or even 150W of power consumption in some games and that amounts to quite a bit of savings if you look at a 3 year period especially if you live in a country where electricity is expensive. Also the reduced heat is a bonus in the summer.,Positive

For me Windows has just become too bloated and digging its claws into every little thing that it's finally reaching ""straw that broke the back"" moment for me, and AMD is basically the bread and butter for Linux with the mesa drivers basically embedded in them out of the gate. Nvidia has made some progress recently on Linux drivers, but for most people it's safe to have an AMD card if you are going exclusively Linux for the foreseeable future.",Positive

AMD,"An easy way to think about it is that the 5700x in gaming will perform similarly to an Intel i5 12400f, which is 6 generations of improvement. Hard to get a proper comparison between these CPUs but games nowadays can take advantage of 6 core 12 thread cpus, so not only is the 5700x alot faster in single core performance (almost double), it's core count advantage gets leveraged as well, turning it into a blood bath. Additionally, with only 4 threads, you might currently experience inconsistent frame pacing which gets worse with stuff in the background like discord.   However, as with all things, if you are fine right now and don't do anything remotely demanding, then no need to upgrade. But in a few years, even a 5700x might feel quite dated relative to new hardware. If you want to ride it out till the end and then get a massive upgrade down the line that could also be a choice.",Neutral
AMD,"If you're using standardized components, you almost never have to make a complete new PC, but sometimes you have to do major overhauls.

AMD,"It sounds like you're in the boat of upgrade GPU or CPU/mobo first.      I'd recommend CPU/Motherboard, then 32gb of faster memory, then a GPU.  I'd go with the CPU first cause it'll help with gaming and editing.  I'd get the memory next cause editing can eat up a ton of memory.  GPU is last cause the 1070 can still play quite a few games.",Neutral

Regardless, this pic doesn't support your post since it's a combination of CPU and GPU information. NVIDIA isn't in the CPU market and Intel kind of shit the bed so AMD has been dominating in the CPU category recently. Also the hardware stats still indicate that NVIDIA is massively outselling AMD in the GPU on a marketshare basis which really isn't addressed in this graph.

AMD,"""But from a VERY basic knowledge base They are the same thing with a different coat of paint.""  that's the best and most simple explanation.  the GPU itself is the same between the two. the possible performance difference is minimal.  the difference is the cooler, so aesthetics and maybe temperatures but the 9060xt doesn't consume much power so it doesn't heat too much anyways, so the main question would be ""are you willing to pay $50 more for a card that works the same but looks better?""  personally depending on how good the card the looks id do it but it depends on the person",Neutral
AMD,Some brands may have better warranty in your contry than others.,Positive
AMD,"Yeah that's pretty much the difference.  Here is the thing about Video cards. The difference between brands is mostly just what kind of cooler, or ports they have. Some might have OC on them which just means its the same thing but they overclocked it stock.  As far as your computer is concerned they are both the same thing. It could matter if a brand went cheep on thermal pads, paste, etc (or some terrible cooling design) but for the most part its all the same.",Neutral
AMD,"Some brands are going to use different small components, but for the most part it doesn't actually matter. You can buy the highest end version and It can still fail randomly. In my opinion, the only reason to buy a more expensive version of the same card as if it has additional features, such as an m.2 mount on the card (this is a real feature we have seen).  Other reasons to buy different cards is simply aesthetics or maybe the size. A thicker card is generally going to have better cooling, but a thinner card isn't going to need additional support from a GPU bracket. If you don't plan to overclock, I would generally recommend something smaller.",Neutral

AMD,If the first day game support remains idk what else to want from them since security updates are also there,Neutral
AMD,From my opinion it’s most likely due to an architectural problem that makes drivers more resource intensive while also trying to make drivers for udna. It’s a shame but at least amd is open sourced enough to where third party drivers can be made and can perform exceptionally well.,Negative
AMD,"I'm unsure what you actually think they did here though.  They're not doing or saying anything here that nvidia isn't also doing. nvidia isn't actively optimizing for the 20 or 30 series anymore either.

AMD,"20 series already has hardware that supported DLSS, the same way RDNA3 supports FSR4. DLSS4 is just an upgrade for it. 20 series also did not get FG or MFG. 30 series didn't get Smooth Motion either.  RDNA 1 and 2 on the other hand clearly don't have the capabilities to run FSR4 well.

They could've thrown a bone to older card users and just made the release official...

AMD,"iirc benchmarks show that while RDNA2 could run it, the performance uplift was a lot less than RDNA3. With that I mind I can see if AMD wouldn't want to support it.  Not to mention the reason why they still didn't add official support for RDNA3 was because they're still working on improving the performance gains. If RDNA2 cards would have even worse gains than RDNA3, AMD themselves might conclude it's not worth it.",Negative
AMD,because people can't accept that Nvidia is in dire need of criticism and a huge downfall.,Negative
AMD,Its not unplayable at 5/10% less FPS but its kinda unplayable if your game crashes,Negative
AMD,It means it's more likely the future titles won't run well due to them being demanding more so than lack of proper driver support.,Negative

AMD,"ah, so its ""what ifs"" you are worried about .... makes sense ... stop worrying about something that may happen and start worrying about things that actually have happened.",Negative
AMD,"I believe those unplayable bugs would still have gotten updated in what and originally stated. Mostly just optimizations, performance and feature updates won’t happen",Negative
AMD,"Spoken like a little pissant nvidia fanboy ""MY TRILLION DOLLAR CORPO NNNNGNGNGNGGNGNNNNNGN!""",Neutral

AMD,Yo so guys can someone come give me some advice ?,Neutral
AMD,"Also I want to add that it doesnt really happen in different game (Cyberpunk, KCD2, Battlefield 6) It´s just in Valorant",Neutral
AMD,It could possibly be the outlet you’re using. Do you plug it into a surge protector?,Neutral
AMD,"Dirty power is right. Doesn’t matter what is plugged into the surge protector, but it matters what’s hooked into the circuit as a whole. Appliances are the enemy of your pc. They tend to have copper wrapped motors that emit feedback within the circuit. Your psu uses small voltages and feedback and power spikes cause the circuitry in your psu to go haywire. It can also produce coil whine and a lot of the noises people complain about in this sub all the time. Most people just don’t know it, they always assume it’s a hardware issue!",Negative
AMD,Are you switching out the cables everytime?,Neutral
AMD,"Dirty power, hook it up to a ups",Neutral
AMD,What BRAND PSU's are you buying?!?!,Neutral
AMD,Is your motherboard properly seated in the case?,Neutral
AMD,"Also, keep in mind surge protectors and power strips aren’t the same thing.   A good quality SP may help.",Neutral
AMD,"Yes, and it’s the only thing plugged into the surge protector",Neutral
AMD,"From what I was told, their outlets were replaced a few years ago. Does it have anything to do with that? Is there a way to test for “dirty power”?",Neutral
AMD,Yes,Positive
AMD,What’s a ups,Neutral
AMD,Thermaltake (tried 3 of these and they all died within months of each other) and vetroo which works just fine in my personal pc build,Positive
AMD,"It should be, on the standoffs right? The psu dies every few months not as soon as it’s installed",Negative
AMD,Try replacing the surge protector. These things are basically a bunch of capacitors and if it goes bad it can deform the sine wave of the mains and that can damage PSU and other electronics.,Negative
AMD,Try getting a UPS and not just a surge protector. Dirty power is a thing.,Negative
AMD,"There are devices that can be bought to test for feedback and power bleed. It won’t be an “outlet” issue, it’s a circuit issue.",Neutral
AMD,What PSUs have you tried?,Neutral
AMD,Uninterruptible power supply. It’s basically a battery backup that will filter the power from your wall and it keeps your computer running if power goes out.,Neutral
AMD,"You can buy a line tester to make sure your AC power is within spec.      If it's bad, there are also products called power conditioners that clean up bad power",Negative
AMD,"Yep, they're like the elastic on a pair of undies",Neutral
AMD,Alright I’ll let them know thank you,Positive
AMD,Would a PS5 have the same issues with that outlet?,Neutral
AMD,Can you see my previous comments? Reddit keeps telling me they were removed due to shortened links. The latest psu was a Vetroo 850W that works fine with my other pc and the original one was a thermal take 850W that we tried multiple of,Negative
AMD,"Interesting, this pc is one that I’ve been replacing the psu in for someone and they’ve said they’re likely just gonna get a new pc and sell me this one. If this happens again I’ll recommend this to them.I think they have a backup they use and the backup doesn’t seem to go out like this one does.",Neutral
AMD,"It could have similar issues, though no guarantee. The power supplies in a pc and a ps5 don’t exactly ground the same. However both units provide small voltage through small wire. So if it’s a feedback or spiking issue it can definitely cause the same problems.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, this sub bans certain types of links.  I've never heard of Vetroo, but the Thermaltake ones should have been good/decent. With that knowledge, I can only assume it's a power issue. Do you have black/brown outs? It could also be dirty power. Either way, I would recommend getting a UPS.",Negative
AMD,Make sure the hdmi is plugged into the graphics card,Neutral
AMD,That thing will rock 1440p high at over 100 fps on just about anything short of a couple newer games.  1.)Make sure your monitor refresh is actually set to 180 Hz\ 2.)Use Radeon Chill to set your FPS limit to 177 FPS. Set both limits to 177 FPS\ 3.) Set “Wait for VSync” to “always on”\ 4.) Set AMD FreeSync to either AMD Optimized or Always on\ 5.) Enable FSR4\ 6.) Enable AMD Image Sharpening. I leave it at the default 50 setting.  Do not enable VSync within the graphics settings of any game. Ever.  Set the graphics settings of basically any game to High or Very High. I typically don’t go over High because the visual quality difference typically minimal but the compute resources cost is huge.,Neutral
AMD,"Looking for advice on settings? What games are you playing? Use the settings presets in the graphics menu and choose the setting that looks/plays/feels best, there's really not much else to it. Enjoy some games!",Positive
AMD,"Look up how to disable GPU driver updates from Microsoft. Windows has a persistent problem where it rolls them back for AMD. Install and use the AMD Adrenalin program to update drivers. AMD Adrenalin also has a sound filtering function, which is great if you play online games with a mic.  If your display has HDR, you need to also enable it in Windows and you may need to also calibrate it. If your monitor has Freesync/Vsync, enable it in GPU settings. Cap FPS at 10-15 below refresh rate for smoothest performance.   Use Steam and GOG for games. Wishlist anything you're interested in to be notified when it goes on sale.   Nexus Mods is the go-to site if you want to explore mods. Being able to customize games is one of the fun things about PC.   If you still prefer using a controller, look up one with Hall Effect or TMR sticks. Way better than the default ones, although they lack the dualsense haptics.",Neutral
AMD,"Isthereanydeal.com is a good way to find the cheapest price currently for a game you want right now.  Steam wishlist is a great way to just kinda have a running list and something to shop from when the sales hit. Steam has a solid sale every season or so.   You console controller will probably come in handy.  I don’t have a mouse pad, but one of those pads that cover half the desk, including the keyboard. It’s more comfortable to me.  Get a solid chair. Look up good keyboard ergonomics. Carpel tunnel is better prevented than treated.  My opinion, $30 cheap speakers and a solid wired headset, and a decent stand alone mic will go far. All my wireless gaming headsets all died In like 18 months, even the $300 turtle beaches. When gaming with your boys headset is in. When you’re relaxing on YouTube, the little speakers will be more relaxing. My headset is a like $60 Phillips and it has lasted years, comfy and sounds nice for me. I think the surround sound headsets are a gimmick but your mileage may very.   Enjoy brother! Go look up satisfactory!  If you don’t have a discord account, look it up. Almost all games have a discord server and great place to meet people to play with or learn games.  Okay I just reread your post. lol this is everything other than settings advice.

Loads of PC guys in a circle jerk wanking each other off about 2 grand systems whilst consoles just ignored them.  It was maybe funny for 2 days but it's just embarrasing. Also don't call your pc a rig. You only get to say that if you made the case yourself or you bolted it to your car.

AMD,I dont understand,Negative
AMD,1st thing I did once my monitor was set up.,Neutral
AMD,"several settings to change too if it can't quite handle high. It will be game-dependent. Now that you're on PC with decent refresh rate, try turning off motion blur, most PC gamers don't like or use it, but it's just built into the console versions. Sometimes you will have to look up specific games, but shadows is often a resource hog that can get turned down a notch or two if fps isn't where you want it.",Neutral
AMD,"blurbusters tested end to end input latency and found that typically 3-4fps under the refresh rate is enough to keep input latency at a minimum while using vsync. If you don't use a frame cap with vsync you will incur a large amount of input lag if your card can render the game above the refresh consistently.  Nvidia will enable its own frame cap when you use reflex with vsync, they use 4-9% under the refresh (larger for higher refresh) rather than a fixed number. At 144hz they use 138, about 4% lower, at 240hz they use 225 which is 6% lower, at 360hz they use 328 which is 9% lower. Higher refresh doesn't scale how you think, going from 144hz to 240hz (adding 96hz) is 2.7ms smaller frametimes, but going from 240hz to 360hz where you add 120hz is only 1.4ms smaller frametimes, that's probably why nvidia doesn't just do ""3fps below"", they are making sure a minimum number of milliseconds is held before the next frame comes in even though blurbusters finds input lag reduces at only 2fps below even up to 240hz https://blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-lag-tests-and-settings/5/",Neutral

AMD,"Praise the lord. I've been hoping they would drop one of these for some time. Getting one with an X3D CCD would be insane, but likely not possible with the current Strix Halo packaging design.",Positive
AMD,Honestly would be pretty neat. I’ve seen the full strip halo and it looks nice but for a gaming APU a bit overpowered(?),Positive
AMD,Honestly this. It’s not like for the purpose of gaming there’s anything that will run well on the 8060S but be bottlenecked by 5060’s 8GB vram after DLSS.,Negative

AMD,"AMD certainly has a knack for putting out news in the most horrible way possible...  Then needing to do damage control after the fact.  Here is a simple workflow that might help.  1. Write the announcement - do not release it to the public. 2. Privately give it to a few key tech reviewers (under NDA of course). 3. Take the reviewer's feedback. 4. Adjust the phrasing of the announcement. 5. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 until the messaging isn't damning. 6. Release the announcement to the public.

Pick a lane, it can't be both.  Given the continual form that they've demonstrated, I'm far more likely to believe that a department with Frank Azor at its head released half baked comms that have done nothing but confuse people about their decision making, rather than attempt to kill off earlier generations of tech.  Maybe a rose tinted perspective, but the degree to which people jumped out a window on this was kind of insane to me.",Negative

AMD,"This doesn't sound as a 'revert' per se, which is quite terrible, because it tells me FSR4 will not be released on RDNA2 whatsoever, although it could technically run it, but on the other hand, how many times do people need to realize AMD simply isn't up to par with nVIDIA when it comes to driver support and forward architecture thinking?  Turing (2018) has dedicated RT/Tensor cores specifically designed for RT/DLSS, whereas RDNA3 (2022 - **4 YEARS LATER**) doesn't, and with that, I think I said it all.  In fact, I'm already sure RDNA 3 and even 4 will have the same faith, as UDNA/RDNA 5 will be a totally different architecture - which, by the way, will be literally a copy of Turing from a core perspective, which was released, once again, in 2018 -- 'Radiance Cores' are the ray-tracing cores, and 'Neural Arrays' are the tensor cores - obviously, much more powerful than Turing's, but you get the point - AMD is about 9 years behind nVIDIA in terms of architecture philosophy at this point.  So do not act surprised that 5700 XT didn't have more value compared to 2070S at 100$ more as some of people thought, there's a reason ""nVIDIA -50$"" doesn't work anymore, those 50$ will bite you in your ass next time and people have woken up.",Negative
AMD,"It's all related to lack of AI Accelerators in RDNA 1 & 2. Moving forward thanks to all the ""FSR is crap because AMD GPUs don't have AI"" crowd, you will get the same Nvidia treatment: Every new feature will be tied to new graphic generation.  The only difference in AMD case is that they chose to split drivers so you don't have to download all the ""new crap"" that doesn't work on your GPU generation or be hit by regressions.  RTX 2000 & 3000 went in maintenance mode the moment Nvidia announced DLSS FrameGeneration, and now even RTX 4000 is obsolete since it doesn't have MultiCrapFrameGeneration.",Negative

And the recent driver release only adds `VK_KHR_shader_untyped_pointers` for RDNA3+, despite this being a quality of life extension that all hardware can support.  This means either graphics programmers have to plan around the RNDA2 drivers for the next 3 years and not require anything new, or they only support RDNA3+. Both are bad, and this is only caused by AMD wanting to save money in the wrong place.",Negative

Nvidia for years and years and years supported GTX 10 and 900 series on the main branch even though yeah they got no DLSS and tensor core features, yet Nvidia didn't split them off until literally last month, AND GTX 16 series, Turing but with the tensor cores ripped out is still supported in the main branch!  And as a 6950XT owner I usually use the latest drivers and haven't had problems, RX 9000 coming didn't suddenly make my drivers start to be less optimised, been as soild as always. In fact a few months ago a driver update actually fixed a major visual issue in Forza Horizon 3, a game from 2016 that's delisted. Whatever driver tweaking had been made fixed this old game's problems that it'd had since at least 2022 apparently. Guessing there can't be a repeat of that with the drivers split, lol.   The Radeon software got updated on the main branch this month and I saw none of it on my 6950 XT, come on, if updates and improvements to the very driver app for my GPU don't even get ported over, what can I actually expect AMD to do?

AMD,As someone who had the pleasure in the past to own such a laptop with 2 AMD/ATI(so old can't remember what it was but I am pretty sure it was called ATI then) GPUs you will have to stay on the older driver. Maybe disabling the older GPU and go full performance with the newer one and latest driver will work. And there is the very rare possibility that AMD manages to make 2 different branches work on the same PC. And for those that say it might work the simple fact of having to use the same file names in the same path disproves this as chances are newer files from the newer branch won't work with the old branch GPU ones and vice versa.

There is diffrence in extensions but most extensions are optional and obviously no one cares about raytracing really on GTX 960.   What will happen from onwards on, is AMD will NOT update vulkan extensions and likely vulkan/WDDM/DX12 versions/extensions for RDNA1 and RDNA2 unless there is business benefit for them to delegate few engineers to upgrading RDNA1/RDNA2 package to support missing stuff for particular title.  Business benefit = backlash outweighs milking customers moving to newer GPUs. What should tell you backlash per title/game support basis needs to be REALLY strong.  The real mega embarrasing stuff is that Nvidia maxwell is from 2014, and Nvidia pascal is from 2016, and those technically still have feature support (it is ending with end of R580 release driver branch) when RDNA2 doesn't and latest RDNA2 full GPU was released just 2 years ago and iGPUs are still produced today.

They didn't even wait a full 24 hour to provide this.

At least with my old laptop, I could use the old driver for both GPUs but I couldn't install the new driver and use it in the old GPU. And mixing 2 drivers is impossible as both drivers want to put files with the same filename in the system32 folder.

All those ""extra bits you wouldn't expect to run on a 960"" are the actual important features. For example nothing that old supports mesh shaders, meaning you wouldn't be able to run games utilizing modern rendering pipelines with no alternatives anyway.   This entire comment is basically framed in a way to make it sound like Nvidia is doing something it's not and AMD is doing something far worse when they are essentially doing the same thing.

AMD,"The Apple logo's IP is primarily protected by both trademark and copyright law.  Design patents are more for things like e.g. the precise shape, arrangement, colours, and look of the camera bump; including where the flashlight is positioned, and where the LIDAR is positioned.  Exactness matters a lot for design patents. For example, if you took the same iPhone 17 camera layout, but made the bump corners more squircle and less rounded; and placed it on the right-hand-side (instead of left); that's probably not enough to infringe a design patent; especially if you use different subtle but noticeably different colours for your materials.",Neutral

AMD,"The 5700 XT launched in 2019 for $399. At $599 the 9070 XT is at a 50% markup, which is 23% above inflation costs.  At the rate of inflation between 2019 and 2025, factoring in Moore's Law, this GPU tier should retail at $499, at the most, not $599.  So either Moore's Law is truly dead, or GPU manufacturers and retailers are price gouging, (and contrary to what the industry wants you to think, Moore's Law isn't dead, at least not yet).  Also, if your response to this is ""but the 9070 XT is well over 200% faster than the 5700 XT, a 50% markup is acceptable in comparison to the performance increase"", then you don't understand Moore's Law and you're part of the reason GPU prices continue to go up.",Neutral

AMD,"My first GPU was an AMD 9700/9800 Pro. I may have gotten a few more after that but I never turned back after my first 1060. The driver support from AMD was horrendous. I tried a 7700XT this year and still had issues with software. And now they do this... Yeah, i'll stick with my overpriced Nvidia GPU's thanks.",Negative
AMD,Got to be honest as 7900 XTX owner feels like as soon as AMD released the 9070 xt they abandoned us. Like 7900 XTX buyer were early adopters. Took AMD whole year to fix VR perf on 7900 XTX. AMD never gave clear answer on FSR4 support for 7900 XTX. My next gpu prob not going to be from AMD.,Negative

AMD,"Its not like they are supporting new games anyway some new games have random driver timeouts like cyberpunk 2077 or the last of us part 2 was not playable without random driver timeouts on release just got fixed, thanks AMD but should be on day 1.  Or Hell Divers 2 that had issues at launch, or Dying light 2 that had RGB laser show bug outside the Radeon boost issues the game had for 1 and half year or so more or less.  As well as some unity based games having random driver timeouts on least RDNA3 due those games not handling the high clock speeds that well on stock.  They may be dropping support, but they never properly supported these gpu's to begin with and now RDNA3 we just waiting for games to be playable, by the time it gets fixed it wont matter anymore, i could not play wow for example during the entire Dragonflight expansion and wasted 200+ euros on a game and subscription that i could not play for almost entire expansion, so i am happy i can finally play it again.  Hopefully i can as well during midnight expansion which has its first beta on 11 november now.  The attitude AMD often has oh its just hardware issue 99% of the time its a driver issue and their vanguard program users unable to reproduce issues, simply due lack of information required to fix these issues, because sometimes its not easy to reproduce however for those having issues, avoiding the issue is as simple as simply not playing the game with the issue, as much that sucks.  And there is the Radeon tax you pay you only get to play what the vanguard program users like to play, you want to play that latest game that AMD has not enough users playing well tough luck and sometimes its also because NVIDIA simply makes the game unavaible until launch so AMD can only fix it as soon as its released, so NVIDIA wins by default because AMD cannot support the game to begin with at launch.     So yeah that AMD is just straight out saying they putting RDNA1/2 in Maintenaince mode not supporting the latest games really pisses me off, but its not like they doing that right now anyway even RDNA4 suffers from issues with games at launch.  But i will compliment AMD for finally working with game devs these days they been doing that for over a year or 2 now and probably longer, but they have to figure out how to do things better, because this is not acceptable.  I could litterally spend time making memes out of these driver issues and actual proof that these issues are actually real driver issues, but i do not like a burnout or work for free, which is why i rejected joining the vanguard program few times in the past, alto i have cooperated with some users figuring things out even testing things, but AMD should honestly do this them self.  But i am still avaible to do so eitherway if i am able to do that, but as some one hat has no job AMD could really do something about it and start hiring people for these type of things, so they can actually fix things rather then ignore these issues.",Negative

AMD,"Yeah Vega (last competitive card in my line of work.) and Radeon Pro Renderer debacle is prob the reason why AMD GPU's are something I will never consider them as a 3d artist/animator.  (Pro renderer was pretty much forcing every 3d developer to learn their standard vs the industry standard for a 5-10% performance boost. When the Vega 64/1080 ti where pretty competitive in Blender Cycles at the time where it depended on the work load (lots of textures to load? Vega wins with it's memory. A lot of calculations the 1080 ti would edge out in render time. Pretty much 2 years after they just dropped support and in that time NVIDIA has secured such a lead that the 9070 XT is around the performance of a 3060 and 3060 ti in rendering. 7900xtx without zluda is around 4060 tier, and 7900xtx with zluda was slightly below 4060 ti.)",Negative
AMD,"You have to look at it from a profit standpoint. Only 10% of AMDs profit comes from the gaming sector. This includes profit from Xbox/Playstation business as well. Their desktop GPU share is in the single digits. There have been multiple years where this sector operated as a loss for their overall business. So honestly it really doesn’t matter how mad you get. Now that AI is starting to be a bigger part of overall profitability, your voice is getting smaller and smaller. Gaming is evolving into a service as it is. Hardware eventually won’t matter much. Only difference will probably end up being how you want to experience it. Like watching Netflix on your phone or a big screen. Everything will be a “gaming device”. Younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha are the tablet generation anyway. One of the reasons why the Switch and Switch 2 did so well.

AMD hasn't dropped driver support for RX 5000/6000; there simply aren't any more specific game optimizations for RDNA 2/1. Therefore, your cards won't become unusable overnight. Driver support with bug fixes will continue. If a game doesn't work due to a bug, it will be fixed as before. Sometimes I question some people's common sense.

If AMD truly wants to improve and be innovative, they kind of have to cut corners in some areas.  It certainly stinks for the people who own older GPUs, but I think most people won't notice a big difference. I had an RX 6950 XT myself and didn't update that card regularly. That doesn't mean other people didn't have problems, but speaking from my point of view, there isn't that big of an improvement from the Day 1 updates. At least, I didn't really notice it.  Ultimately, it's the developer's job to optimize a game. Everything on AMD's side that causes games to crash and not start will still be fixed.

AMD,"I am not an AMD fanboy, or have any allegiance but I am somewhat understanding of their decision.  Providing game optimization for 2+ year old, previous generation, GPU's requires a lot of work and expense.  AMD has to constantly be releasing new tech, at a ridiculous pace just to keep up.  Thus, cutting off support for ""old"" products is not unheard or, or unreasonable.  The RDNA 1 and 2 generations are nearly 5 years old.  While they did release new product within the last couple years, it was primarily for the Chinese market.  Furthermore, this announcement is likely being driven in part by game developers who are frustrated with the demand to release higher levels of game performance, and yet still capable of running on older GPU's.........Besides, is this the excuse we're all looking for to justify that next purchase?",Negative

I understand the game runs well on 6000 but it’s literally laughable that the min and recommended GPUs for BF6 don’t have game support from AMD when AMD and retailers were still selling very new 6000 series cards this year.   I’m not gonna lie, I usually upgrade my GPU every 5 years and I’ll prob build a new PC soonish so even if AMD’s standard is now 5 years for Radeon, I won’t be affected but people keeping their cards for a decade will be.  I understand that from AMD’s perspective it’s hard because all of these GPU arch’s a a bit different but it’s just a rough move going forward. Like RDNA5/6 is also supposed to be a diff arch, UDNA is what I think they are calling it. So that prob means 9000 series owners will lose support also in 5/6 years.",Negative
AMD,">rx580 still gets driver updates  >I won't say it's neglected  Not really, though. This is something I came across when trying dxvk on a bit older laptop. It needs the `VK_KHR_maintenance5` Vulkan support level for newer releases, which the hardware supports. That all works fine under Linux drivers, but AMD gave up on Windows feature support, so it doesn't work with Windows at all.",Neutral

Thing was only 1 generation old at the time. It hasn't even been a year yet and it's still a great card.

AMD,"This is the real problem.  In a vacuum, maybe it's just a bad look and AMD could get away with it.  But trailing a distant 2nd in the market, supposedly trying to gain market share, AMD absolutely cannot burn customer goodwill like this.

AMD,"Tbf the 12vhp is mostly only an issue for the RTX 5090, the lower power cards it's not much of one.",Neutral
AMD,"I'll bite.      Losing Day 1 driver support will mean poorly optimised at launch titles like Borderlands 4 will either run badly or potentially not at all when released, and opens the question as to when exactly they will be backported. While you can argue this isn't really AMD's (or nVidia) job to fix it helps develop a sense of existing customer support for medium age product (the oldest RDNA2 card is less than 5 years old, the newest less only 2) which can in turn cultivate sustained brand loyalty.   AMD was widely praised for using 16GB of VRAM in the 6000 series specifically because it would likely allow the cards to age well as VRAM became a larger consideration, by cutting driver support to maintenance mode they've now done they exact opposite.      The bigger issue is that this may hint that RDNA2 cards will not be receiving official FSR4 support, which would be a massive blow to customers with those cards because FSR4 is a significant improvement on previous iterations of the technology and we have proof, albeit unofficial, that RDNA2 cards can support FSR4 natively and gain significant benefit from it.",Negative
AMD,I would get occasional crashes in some games with my Vega 64. Otherwise not that big of a deal.  But why wouldn't you get a card with better long term driver and software support if you can? I was on a Vega 64 till two weeks ago but finally jumped ship to an Nvidia 5060ti 16gb for $400.,Neutral
AMD,"Because people are fucking stupid, and act as if their cards suddenly just blew up. Reality is, AMD cards run games fine without day 1 drivers or anything. RX 580 of yours can even run software ray tracing games like Silent Hill f.",Negative

The Battlefield 6 compatible driver caused the Adrenaline to recognize the game as Elder Scrolls Online, fucking lol. Previously I was on 25.8.1 and it was fine.   That's literally the only change between 25.8.1 and 25.10.2 i've noticed and due to that Elder Scroll bullshit I actually regret updating. Should've stayed on old driver.

AMD,"Some games need driver updates. I keep my drivers updated, so it's never an issue for me. But my partner doesn't do that, and had multiple issues last few years where a new game didn't work properly. And where ""did you remember to update the video driver"" was the fix.",Negative
AMD,"Bit dramatic. There have been several games recently where NVIDIA didn't provide day one drivers for even **their latest** 5000-series graphics cards. On top of that, the 5000-series has been plagued by driver issues causing stuttering and black screen crashes for several months while the RX 9000-series has been rock solid.  They're still getting drivers. You may miss out on 0-5% performance on a game's launch (with emphasis on 0%), on 5 year old hardware. If this causes you to go NVIDIA, which has even more driver-related issues at the moment, you're ridiculous.",Negative
AMD,"Me too, already put my 7600 for sale to get a 4060 ti instead",Neutral
AMD,Nvidia hardly respects gamers either. They would throw us all under the bus to sell more AI chips to enterprise tomorrow if it was as simply as flicking a switch.  Currently the state of the GPU market if you want to at least try to do the right thing is picking the least worst option whoever that is for you. None of them are loyal to us.,Negative
AMD,"Evil is still evil.   I just bought a 9070XT knowing what AMD did and I don't care, it's the best upgrade I could get for the amount I paid.  I paid 730$ for it, a 5070 Ti here costs around 900$ for the base models.   No way in hell is virtually same performance worth 160$ more. DLSS4 is tempting, but not for 160$.",Negative

Honestly if anyone were to flaunt that card in front of me they’d be in for a fucking black eye. I don’t even want the card, but the thought of it existing enrages me.  Also I have completely dumped windows for Linux now (mostly pertaining to how I cannot control windows update when it comes to drivers, it seems to ignore everything I throw at it short of a group policy, even now I can’t do that because Microsoft disabled my pro key over the petty reason that they no longer allow upgrades from windows 7, 8 and 10 to 11.

AMD cards are not only flawless but works better with Linux (RT support for Vega and Polaris by repurposing the compute cores? Yes please!)",Negative
AMD,"I lost count of games I have preordered, crashing due to documented AMD driver issues. FSR4 not available for RDNA3 made me sell my XTX and finally switch to Nvidia.  And I enjoyed my XTX, despite the insane heat and power draw required to match a 4080S in performance. While sucking at RT, No Upscaling, No Reflex, broken DSC implementation and the list goes on. Adrenaline would crash on startup on fresh windows installs for months, until they \*finally\* fixed it. Their overlay crashing Helldivers entirely, games not detected, settings not applying on reboot.  R9 270, RX 480, 6950 XT, 7900 XTX. Not even one of these cards did not not have issues. And not like Nivida, oh the grass won't display well in that one game. No, 23.10.1, 23.10.2 and even 23.11.1 broke Hardware Acceleration completely. Edge, Steam and Discord in foreground would freeze the entire PC for seconds.  And I kept it all clean, updated, Windows, BIOSes, you name it.

AMD,"I see more people moving to Linux distros like nobara and bazzite, with Microsofts force-feeding windows 11 shenanigans the past months.   Personally, the only thing I didn't get working yet is steamVR. Other than that I have no need for windows, at all.",Neutral

AMD,About to be in that % hence why I bought AMD cards recently for that exact reason. Will maintain copies of Windows for when needed.,Neutral
AMD,"Yes I saw that, it probably does means that they wont get game specific drivers but it doesn't *explicitly* say that. It says they will focus on RDNA 3 and 4, but that doesn't mean they wont get them at all, it just might be later. That's why I'm saying it might've been better to wait and get **clarification** before dropping a video that will rile people up without knowing for a certainty.",Neutral
AMD,Day 1 drivers are mostly marketing but they do occasionally fix bugs in the game that you will encounter without them.   It’s not a big deal though.,Neutral
AMD,"And still, RDNA 2 will still get updated driver but probably not as frequently.   I think that once UDNA/RDNA5 comes, people will mostly forget about RDNA2 regardless.",Neutral
AMD,"It doesn't matter. It is much easier, from now on.  Does a GPU have AI capabilities? Yes = full support, No = half support.   (I am talking about FP8 or better. Not just INT8)",Positive
AMD,That global decision is from now on.   AMD and Nvidia doing it basically at the same time.,Neutral
AMD,GTX900 1000 so call support are just bug fix,Negative
AMD,"Nvidia doesn't do this for their 3000 series, I think the 900s had 9 years of support or something like that",Neutral
AMD,Agreed. And they’re even worse.   I have a motherboard with an Nvidia chipset that can never work on windows 10. Installing win10 causes the board to try to install two separate GeForce drivers side by side until the registry becomes corrupted.,Negative
AMD,It's in maintaince mode. So no day 1 or day 1000 games optimisation. Please learn the meaning of maintaince. Only security and bug fix.   So stop spreading misinformation,Negative
AMD,Not saying anyone is right or wrong here but when was the last time someone absolutely needed the game ready driver for a game to work at all.   Battlefield 6 just dropped and you can play it with almost any driver in the last 12 months and still get the expected performance based on benchmarks. The scope of dropping these optimizations for older cards doesn't seem as outrageous as it would be on Nvidia where games frequently have severe bugs or don't work without the Day One driver update (EX: Final Fantasy 16 on Nvidia).  I do forsee a problem though where if RDNA1 and 2 do not receive updates on a regular basis they might get gated out of launching a game with astonishingly lazy driver detection (like Warzone).,Neutral

AMD,"Yea no OEM is providing the level of support that AMD was themselves. As a follower of the PC handhelds since GPD's first launch in 2016, watching AMD move into this scene was like a drunk bull in a china shop.  OEMs do not want to write drivers for your hardware, they make little profit as is per machine, and long term support is not in their best interest. You will get a few drivers throughout the year if you are lucky, but their support is not going to be on the level of what AMD could provide. When the 780m came out from AMD, i was an early adopter in the form of the GPD Win Max 2 and many of the smaller OEMs had to battle AMD to start maintaining their drivers for their product as they did try and rug pull everyone with that ""OEM maintains drivers"" for a product none of them had architectural knowledge of.

AMD,Depending on your area the price difference definitely affects the equation.  If a 9070xt is 700 euros and a 5070ti is 1000 euros then that's definitely a no brainer to go with the 9070xt.  Even if you only get 4-5 years of full driver support that's still a better deal.   In the US where the price difference is only $75 to $100 it makes more sense to go with the 5070ti.,Neutral

Or let say if you play game as a service (fortnite, warzone, war thunder etc.) and let say two years down the line they have big overhaul to the engine, a game you played and enjoyed with no issue with your current GPU might not work well all of a sudden, even though it still has the capability to run the game well.",Neutral

The cards will still be in ""Maintenance mode"".   This is AMD trying to save face. I have 3 AMD motherboards in my room, have never built an Intel system. My first GPU was the ATI 9700/9800 pro.

AMD,"Also means any bugs or visuals in the game due to AMD’s existing drivers.   But like I said, there isn’t much else you lose. The old GPUs work but new games may be hit or miss. I think people are just angry that this is a product AMD sold as recently as 2 years ago with refreshes and that it is now effectively just dead for optimizations and game bug fixes.",Negative
AMD,"It's more than that. Example: I have a Vega 56, so I am on the same maintenance driver branch as your RX580. I could not play the BF6 beta - the client flagged my GPU as having an old driver version. Now, I don't know if that changes for the retail release - BF6 system requirements list RDNA 1 GPUs as being compatible, but now they're only going to get maintenance releases and they won't be on the current driver branch either. My point though is that ""optimizations"" is understating what is happening for being able to play new games at all",Negative
AMD,"Theres a lot of problems. For one, if there's a game where it refuses to start on older drivers (which is more common than you think), it means you're effectively SOL on playing that game. This is especially bad on RDNA2 iGPUs like the 680m (and apparently even the 780m is affected by this which means new game support is going to be unoptimized as shit on Windows handhelds) which can be touchy at playing some of the newest games without the latest drivers.",Negative
AMD,"> so you're effectively losing a bit of performance in new games. what else?  Imagine you're buying a new GPU by observing the FPS benchmarks for *Game #1*. And then the sequel called *Game #2* comes out but your GPU performs weaker than it should, not because it lacks raw power but because AMD or Nvidia simply did not prep the driver to fully utilize your GPU.  If we're talking about an older card, I kind of get it. If we're talking about a 2-4 year old card like the RX6000 series, I think that's a huge blunder.",Negative

AMD,Things like the steamdeck are RDNA 2 as well,Neutral
AMD,Same. Was perfect before this.,Positive
AMD,"Overwatch 2 does shader compilation every time you launch the game for the first five minutes or so on Radeon cards. After that it should run fine. If it doesn't, check if it somehow switched to the much less performant DX12 API in the game.",Neutral
AMD,"It's being updated but stuff like day 1 support for games would be delayed and they would focus on RDNA 3 AND 4 first, but it would be still be updated.",Neutral
AMD,"Optimizations I can understand because there are architectural differences in the hardware from each vendor. There are cases where things take different amounts of time or resources depending on the hardware. And each vendor wants the best FPS number in the day one reviews for AAA games.  But how do glitches occur if the software is written according to the API standards, and how is it AMD's responsibility to fix them if the software is glitchy because it didn't follow the standards?  Or are game engines and gfx drivers much less [deterministic](https://wippler.dev/posts/determinism-in-software---the-good,-the-bad,-and-the-ugly) than I'm assuming?",Neutral

AMD,Do you have a ram issue?,Neutral
AMD,"Just to clarify, Linux drivers are a separate ecosystem from Windows. RDNA2 cards get feature updates and optimizations through AMDGPU/Radv/Mesa (although recently radv and mesa combined) independent of Windows ‘Game Ready’/maintenance mode. Even the Steam Deck will keep getting Vulkan/driver improvements. So ‘maintenance mode’ on Windows doesn’t mean Linux support is frozen, the open source stack evolves on a different schedule and often keeps older cards performant for years. i.e the HD 7000 (from 2012) series is still receiving game patches on linux.",Neutral
AMD,"Mine is actually crashing my pc on wake(just monitor shutting off). I even reverted to the previous driver and I am still having issues, multiple DDU as well. Absolutely no problems prior.     Edit. After doing a factory reset via the adrenaline software for 25.9.2 (again after using DDU a few times) it seems to have been fixed.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, on my previous cpu (ryzen 5 3500x) I had like no fps in the first 5 minutes, but since I upgraded to ryzen 7 5700x, it takes no time to load the shaders and I can play with 300+ fps. Now after this driver update it's around 150, and doesn't improve, not even after 30 minutes. But I will check again later today.  To be honest I had a lot of issues with this gpu and I'm really fed up with it. Thinking about switching to nvidia.",Negative
AMD,Games are built with the generic APIs and hardware agnosticism in mind. A hardware vendor like AMD can always look at its driver to see if it can improve its interaction with the game to get additional performance out of it or if the game's implementation is conflicting somehow with the driver then see if it can be improved. In the vast majority of cases this doesn't result in big improvements but there have been cases in the past where driver patches greatly improved the performance or reliability of a game.,Neutral
AMD,"I recall that Intel's Tom Peterson stated in an interview that some games are not fully compliant with API standards; developers check if it works on their test hardware, but not necessarily whether it works because of implementation-specific behavior.",Neutral

AMD,"With 16GB memory, it'll be great for existing games and mid-tier for new games for a while yet. Just looks like AMD have decided to give up all pretenses of porting new software driver features into RDNA(2).",Positive
AMD,"Nvidia relased DLSS4 on the 2060, an almost 8 years old card, so yeah, branching an architecture (placing it outside new games optimizations) that is still on the market (APUs) is not just bad, is totally unacceptable.",Negative
AMD,What I've read is day 1 optimizations. It doesn't mean they won't receive it.,Neutral
AMD,"These extensions likely require hardware support, so this is no surprise.",Negative
AMD,I have them too if I wouldn't manually offset the frequency. These cards boost way higher than they should which can result in crashes. My card is rated for 2.97Ghz and pushes up to 3.4Ghz which is unstable. Why AMD decides it's ok to push the frequency higher than what it actually should use as a maximum is highly questionable,Negative
AMD,Switching to Nobara this weekend. Thank you for this info,Positive

AMD,Event/BSOD states amdkmdag.sys as the problem.,Negative
AMD,"Yeah, I understand how you feel. I've been playing Overwatch since it came out and it worked flawlessly on Nvidia cards. With Radeon, there is always the pointless shader compilation every fucking time the game is launched and I don't know why it's the case because it absolutely does not happen on Nvidia. My 6700 XT works fine in most games but then there are issues in some games that are AMD only and I miss the days of using an Nvidia cards where I just did not have to think about the GPU at all.",Positive
AMD,"Thanks, that would explain it. I think I was giving game studios too much credit.",Positive
AMD,day 1 optimizations,Neutral
AMD,"I'm not talking about the extensions, ""New Game Support"" is the problem.",Negative
AMD,"Sure, AMD funds part of the work, but Mesa and RADV aren’t AMD exclusive. Valve, Collabora, and others actively maintain cross architecture code, so RDNA2 still benefits from broader Vulkan and shader improvements. The open driver stack doesn’t stop evolving just because AMD moves on from Windows support.  Mesa and RADV are architecture agnostic in many areas. When new Vulkan extensions or optimizations land, they often improve all supported architectures (including RDNA2) unless there’s a hardware specific blocker. So even if AMD isn’t explicitly targeting RDNA2 you still get continued support and patches.",Neutral

I bought a 7900xtx reference specifically for the usb c port.  This is truly pathetic",Negative

Using a USB-C power meter, we recorded 27 W of power output from the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Impressively, the card can supply full power to the port even without a driver installed, as demonstrated in our test. Installing the latest driver doesn't alter this behavior, indicating that the original driver changelog was just incorrect.",Neutral

Only way to send a message is with your wallet.",Negative
AMD,I keep saying AMD's biggest problem (despite the claims by a certain benchmarking website that they have throw everything into it) is that they seem to do poor investment into marketing.    It's near constant marketing and PR cockups.,Negative

AMD,Its too late now I sold my 6800XT in 2023. Trying to sell one it now even if these changes were not made in late 2025 going to 2026 there isn't much resale value.

So when RDNA 3 launched that was the time to sell RDNA 2 cards waiting until RDNA 4 came out is abit to late.,Negative
AMD,Whos gonna buy it now that it no longer gets support?,Neutral
AMD,"Yes, but that's been an extremely low bar considering how broken Nvidia's were (AMD has been seesawing between terrible and fine depending on generation, with RDNA 1 and 3 having major issues, and RDNA 2 and 4 generally being fine).  Your timing is also kinda bad seeing how 25.10.2 is causing hard crashes and reboots due to driver issues with 9070XTs when computers are left idle.",Negative
AMD,"Oof, that's saying something. Amd has notoriously bad drivers, and that never seems to change",Negative
AMD,Irrelevant if they only last 3 years before entering maintenance mode...  Edit: Clearly this didn't land as the joke it was intended to be following the controversy earlier. I will take my leave.,Negative
AMD,"I mean things definitely aren’t ideal. NVIDIA’s drivers have been dog shit all year long as well. My 5080 still freaks out if there are more than 3 monitors connected, the last truly stable driver from them was 566.36, which was from december 2024 and doesn’t even work on 50 series cards.",Negative
AMD,Well i am for sure happy with my 9070xt. Does its work for less bucks than nvidia,Positive
AMD,"I don’t think they did? The correction is pointing out that it wasn’t changed and the patch notes were just incorrect.   Maybe it was something that was supposed to go out but got pulled cause someone was like, this is pointless it’s a tiny portion of cards and the code isn’t doing anything bad but never got removed from patch notes. Happens sometimes",Negative
AMD,"I can't explain in a more simplified way.  Nvidia started with AI GPUs earlier, thus more AI GPUs left to support.  AMD started late with AI GPUs, thus only RDNA 3 or better, to support.  It is a global decision made by both Nvidia and AMD. It just happened recently, they decided to do it in 2025.   Nvidia did it in July 2025, AMD did it now.",Neutral
AMD,"There isn't any more ""full support"" left to do. These cards are fully optimized and operating near theoretical performance peaks.  For 2027 games the difference between ""full support"" and ""maintenance support"" will be 0 FPS.  For 2029 AAA games, RDNA2 GPUs aren't going to be able to reach acceptable frame rates regardless of full support or not, because they lack the required hardware for the level of raytracing and upscaling that the games will have as minimum requirements.  Whether or not this was done this year, next year, or in 2027 is just optics, it doesn't chance anything.   There hasn't even been much optimization done in the last year anyway, so they've basically been in defacto maintenance mode.",Negative
AMD,"I'll play devil's advocate for a bit.  Nvidia is 13x bigger than AMD, and is almost exclusively focused on GPUs. Yes they do some CPU work (it's mostly ARM chips) and some networking (high GBe NICs), but their core is exclusively compute.  Meanwhile AMD is so much smaller, and their money is split between CPU and GPU divisions; with the CPU side being much healthier financially.  Not defending AMD's move here, but it's a miracle they're even competing at all - anywhere - with Nvidia, given the orders of magnitude less resources they have.   It *LITTERALLY* is David vs Goliath in terms of resources available to get shit done. Hope this at least puts things into context.   TL;DR: Which is why I don't think comparing to Nvidia is fair.",Neutral
AMD,"Does nvidia specify which gpu are not on there priority list? The problem is AMD announced they are just not putting RDNA 1 AND 2 on there 1 day support anymore but they are still supporting the drivers, Did nvidia do that?  Nope it's a problem with AMD release note that broke it that way.",Negative
AMD,"No. FP4 support is for 5000 series only. They could say that they're not supporting 4000 series anymore for new features.  Well, no, they just aren't phrasing it that way because it would drive away customers.  Meanwhile, AMD casually drops that shit.",Negative
AMD,"Yeah, you are not the only one mentioned it, I will edit it.  What I actually meant is specific hardware = Tensor Cores = AI accelerators in general.   Point still stands, hardware is what matters for this decision, not the year of which a GPU was released.",Neutral
AMD,"Thing is my plan was to continue using it for a long while, I knew support would decline *eventually…* but only after *two years* of owning a card that only released a year before I bought it? It’s inexcusable regardless of anything.  As I said in a different comment, there is always something new: Power, VRAM, Raytracing, and now AI.  It’s simply not an excuse.",Negative

AMD,"Lmao no one on this subreddit will accept this even though it's been a thing since the dawn of time.   They both have had their issues. But many people, myself included seems to notice it A LOT more with AMD. I never had an issue on NVIDIAS 900,1000 series cards. As soon as I went to AMD for the 7000. Problems. Black myth was fucked for a week for me. Literally unplayable after a driver update that took a week to get fixed. TLOU2 performance was awful at launch and that took awhile to get fixed. DL2 took a month for like this weird flashing all over the place. DL the beast still crashes randomly.   I mean the only problems I ever had on team green was related to $$$.",Negative
AMD,"is it? If the drivers are good, games work, performance is good, is truly such a travesty?",Positive
AMD,"C'mon, it's mostly 4-6.25 year old GPUs.  Only a handful of 3 year old ones, which would have the same level of high optimizations anyway.  There just isn't much more work to do here, there is basically zero value for game-specific optimization at this point. And if there is a significant issue, we will see a patch for it for at least the next 2 years.  The industry is undergoing a technology transition and RDNA2 is going to be left in the dust for next-gen games, but Nvidia's 20XX series was farther along on the required hardware.",Negative
AMD,"NVIDIA drivers have certainly been pretty sub-par this year. I now and again get a black screen on one monitor (I believe it is related to a VRR bug) in a certain game, only for it to instantly turn back on.   Toggling HDR in Windows sometimes makes both monitors go black, only fix is a reboot.   And I'm on 40 series, and it didn't become an issue until the 50 series launched lol.",Negative
AMD,"2025 release Ryzen Z2A = 0yrs driver support  The GTX 750ti is running October 2025 game ready drivers 11yrs later. At worst, the GTX 1080ti only gets 9yrs + 3yrs security updates.

They still support all RTX generation back to the 20 series which doesn't support FP8 at all. The ""AI specific"" formats introduced and supported are:  30 Series (Ampere) = BF16   40 Series (Ada) = FP8   50 Series (Blackwell) = FP4  Nvidia announced the ending of support for Pascal and Maxwell GPUs, but the first ""game Ready"" driver missing support for those is still not out.",Neutral
AMD,"Sure, I don't expect GPUs that are 1-2 gens older to get any real optimization, but the only problem is that some games have now started putting minimum driver version checkers into their launchers, e.g. BF6.

AMD,"Sure, but just feels like the PS5 has barely gotten off the ground and it is on its 5th year already. Very few games that stand out in comparison to the previous genration, no wow factor at all.  Kinda feels the same going from GCN to RDNA. Sure it is better, but it hasn’t enabled for new gameplay concepts that would not be possible on GCN.",Negative
AMD,"When new games come out, optimizations to drivers are often needed. Sure the card has “full support” for all released games. But new games will be a pain. It’s not uncommon to see 25%+ increases in performance when drivers are optimized for a new game. So no, 2027 games will not see a zero fps difference. Also rdna2 isn’t that old or unsupported. It’s RT capabilities aren’t that much worse than the 7000s and rdna 2&3 both use fsr3. 7000 series is better at matrix multiplication but the 6000 series isn’t bad. The 6900xt has 40 tflops of fp16 performance which is as much as modern nvidia cards. Overall the 6000 series is comparable to the rtx 2000 series which is supported.  Rdna1 had to go. Doesn’t even have mesh shaders.",Neutral
AMD,"It may be David vs Goliath, but from the customer's prespective, that doesn't really matter. AMD was the ""FineWine"" buy. Seems to no longer be the case, which makes AMD seem less apealing than they were before.",Neutral
AMD,"This argument would maybe make sense if Intel, the complete newcomer to dGPUs, hasn't been regularly rolling out updates to Arc multiple times a month since 2022, and their iGPUs have been supported since forever. I think their older iGPU driver branch STILL gets updated.",Neutral
AMD,"To counter though whether they want to or not they have to compete with what’s in the market. The issue is investment into the team.   Profits arent good? Why? It’s because they aren’t competing well against nvidia? Ok let’s make another product to compete and add more resources.   They shouldn’t be letting the team be that small due to profit margins. That would lead to a bad cycle of releases lacking support.  I will say the 9070 xt is awesome though and I have one, but the driver support definitely has room for improvement even on their newest card. If they want to stay in the market they need to grow not stagnate with same size team and stop showing to investors every 5 seconds, but that is wishful thinking for any company perhaps doh.",Negative

Yes, I admit, NVIDIA probably have far more dedicated to their GPU division than AMD, but AMD is still a massive company.   You HAVE to compare AMD to NVIDIA because they are direct competitors. This isn't a fantasy world, they are competition. You can't let shit slide because the competitor is so much bigger. I wouldn't buy an AMD GPU as it stands because of many reasons, but this driver support stuff sure as hell convinces me I won't.",Negative
AMD,"That’s true, I wasn’t trying to nitpick (although I admit I can be bad about it)   No doubt ai hardware is necessary and seems to be the dividing line. The 7000 series is cracked at fp16 performance and can do int8, honestly its WMMA hardware is grossly underused imo. While this is a gross simplification, the 6900xt, 7600xt, and rtx 5080 all have 40 tflops of fp16 performance. It really sucks rdna3 can’t do fp8 calculations. Considering rdna3 is the most powerful gen regarding fp16 performance, I’m hoping fsr4 is brute forced. I know there’s projects but I’m hoping for something official. I have a 4090 and 7900xtx, which I want to give more love.

AMD,"Just because it's a Game Ready Driver, doesn't mean that GPU is receiving a single line of code for any games.  Those cards have likely not received any significant optimization for like 7 years and probably zero optimization for 5 years and are likely just checked for bugs and security on modern OSes, aka ""Maintenance Mode"".  The only reason they're finally being deprecated now is that they won't be able to run the next waves of games because that will require tensor cores or equivalent.",Neutral
AMD,Lol you think a 750ti with only 2Gb of ram is getting day 1 game ready drivers for something like bl4 or bf6? Would you like a cantilever or suspension?,Neutral
AMD,"GTX 750TI longer support, because it is based on Maxwell(GTX 900 series).  And for example GTX 16 is a Turing based GPU just like RTX 20 but lacks Tensor cores(hence the naming GTX vs RTX), it falls right in between and was lucky to stay the course thanks to RTX20, sooner or later Turing full support will be dropped too(I bet GTX 16 will be sooner).  Nvidia announced in July 2025 that they will drop Maxwell and Pascal after October 2025.",Neutral

AMD,"Of course the 2GB card isn't going to be able to play BF6, but the GTX 980ti 6GB based on the same architecture and below game min specs can sure do 1080p60fps low settings with FSR-Q or 70-75fps with FSR-B. The main concern here is how CPU intensive it might be while paired with an equally old CPU.  https://youtu.be/wF0bG3LmGRA  .....  BL4 barely runs on an RTX 3060 12GB at 1080p. Day 1 patches for older/slower hardware won't change that fact that the game runs like ass.",Neutral
AMD,">OK I didn't explain myself properly. I was talking about specific hardware in GPUs.  FP8 is a number format and not something you use to describe hardware components.  >There is a reason they switched naming from GTX to RTX, for example Tensor cores.  That doesn't matter for FP8, all RTX cards have Tensor cores, the difference is in the feature set (sparse matrices support for example) and format support (as per the list in my previous comment).  >Nvidia said that after October driver release, they will drop support, October ends today.  Yes, the older, ""pre-RTX"" cards is what they are dropping support for, specifically the Pascal (2016) and Maxwell (2014) range. It has nothing to do with FP8 format support. The Turing (2018) cards (RTX 20 Series) don't support any of the specific ""AI"" formats (BF16, FP8, FP4) and still have support.",Neutral
AMD,"There is *always* something new, first it was just raw power, then ray tracing, VRAM, and AI. That don’t excuse premature software depreciation.",Neutral
AMD,"I mean, you aren't getting any meaningful game optimizations on a fucking iGPU of all things.",Negative
AMD,"No, Intel stopped supporting their old iGPUs a while ago. They just recently ended active support for 11th-14th gen iGPUs (1st gen Xe iGPUs), which are only 2-4 years old (and 14th gen is still very popular for laptops and desktops).",Neutral
AMD,Right but my point is also they should add more resources to the team which in theory could be utilized for driver support and try to work more with RDNA 2 vs tossing it to a separate release branch and also resources for better GPU support with new stuff as well. So fix the driver support team in general is what I mean.   Whether they like it or not this act looks bad compared to the competition. So we can’t be too fair to them with team size vs Nvidia. AMD should fix that problem not stick with it and just have a smaller team.,Neutral
AMD,You're getting bugfixes and support for new vulkan+dx12 extensions though.,Neutral
AMD,"Sure, but how many people are realistically affected by that to begin with? It's not like iGPUs are typically used for much more than simple tasks like displaying the desktop or web browsing. dGPUs or Strix Halo level APUs are a completely different ball game.",Negative
AMD,"Laptop iGPUs get used for a ton of gaming (usually on potato settings or old/indie games, but engine devs still want to be able to rip out old code paths and be able to rely on modern features since eg. modern vulkan is now much simpler than vulkan 1.0 was, while also having new faster ways to do things).  Desktops and browsers are also moving to Vulkan+DX12 (Gnome's vulkan compositor, chrome and firefox are both shipping vulkan+dx12 backends and requiring them for full webgpu support, etc).  The issue is also when hardware support is ended early like this, then it pushes back the time when developers can start requiring new features to run software, and alternative code paths for hardware that lacks whatever required feature support aren't free to develop or maintain (and in some cases mean you essentially have 2 separate renderers, eg. bindless vs traditional/non-bindless).  This is one of the main reasons software developers are pissed about Intel getting rid of AVX512, because it pushes back the time when devs can start requiring it by ~5 years (meaning they now still have to wait 10+ years they until they can start making it mandatory, instead of in 5-6 years if Intel kept AVX512 support).",Neutral

AMD,"I discovered the cause of a bug that has been plaguing me for years, I thought it was an issue with Windows, but I just recently did a fresh install and discovered it is actually because of ReLive.     The problem is that if you are recording, or have the Instant Replay  feature turned on, when you change the volume and that Windows volume slider appears, it makes the game drop fps/stutter  severely.     Here is a video showing it, look at the fps numbers and graph next to it: [https://streamable.com/ui0vqj](https://streamable.com/ui0vqj)  Relive disabled (sorry for the recording quality, had to do it with my phone): [https://streamable.com/4a7e0h](https://streamable.com/4a7e0h)  There are some games where there is not a fps drop, but it shows some erratic behavior.

AMD,That'd be unfortunate considering that the 6000 series is only a few years old.,Neutral
AMD,it would go down as the shortest lived GPU in recent memories if so,Neutral
AMD,It looks like most of the extensions and their descriptions seem to either support FSR4 (exclusive to rx 9000 and soon to be rx 7000) for Linux or support  Dense Geometry Format (exclusive to future GPUs and possibly rx 9000 series) for Linux.

AMD,No. Just AMD messing around with the drivers.,Neutral

AMD,Does this break the psvr2 support through the port? I was using that for it and it was perfect :O,Positive
AMD,"Nothing really, maybe some stability or crash fixes. Sometimes, it could mean better perf.",Negative

AMD,For example on 25.9.1 driver I wasn't able to use FSR4 on Battlefield 6. For some reason... Less crashes and probably better performance are other perks,Neutral
AMD,Doesn’t mean anything. It’s just marketing. At this point Intel drivers are better than both Nvidia and AMD. They have to try since they’re the underdog.,Negative

AMD,I also have this issue but it only happens sometimes in YT. Such a weird issue.,Negative
AMD,"Every time I ever saw pixel corruption like that it was because of RAM instability. And unfortunately RAM is fickle and hardware vendors take shortcuts.  It's not uncommon for RAM to be perfectly stable at X voltage and Y temperate, and very unstable just a little bit outside of that. It's not uncommon for MB makers to supply more voltage than they claim, because it generally helps with stability which reduces the cost of their returns and warranties. And it's not uncommon for instability to appear in only one specific place when your intuition tells you it should show up elsewhere too.  So my advice is test your RAM in cold and warm scenarios. And try reducing the voltage.",Negative

AMD,good luck gaming on linux,Positive
AMD,for me the exact opposite... 25.9.1 was way better than 25.10.2 or .1 (i tried both) in terms of performance and smoothness especially. It's like i am playing without FSR (it can't be activated anymore.. GOOD JOB AMD!) and still with 130-150fps (with FSR it's like 180-220fps) it feels like low fps  and low hz (60hz?)

AMD,"I'm so sorry to have to do this here, but Reddit has destroyed the old chat system so I can't message you anymore.  I've run into a really strange issue that's quite concerning. When using Relive, if I launch a game and record any gameplay using Relive, Adrenalin of course creates a folder for that game in the designated folder. For Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), it seemed to create a folder that has permissions issues, to put it lightly. I cannot delete the folder and I cannot play any media that's been recorded to it. If I copy or cut the media out into another folder, it plays fine.  Just recently the drive I have been using for Relive media has had issues, so I created a new folder for it on a seperate, newer NVME drive. I put the earlier issues down to just the drive failing and that Adrenalin wasn't at fault at all. I uninstalled Adrenalin, used DDU and did a completely fresh install. Only now, can you guess what has happened? Yep, the exact same thing. Media recorded in the Adrenalin-created Battlefront II folder does not play until cut or copied out of it, and despite my setting user permissions on the main base folder itself, I can't delete the damn thing. Last night it said I didn't have permission. Today, just trying now before writing this message, Windows is telling me the folder doesn't exist.  I'm worried about why this is happening yet again, on a seperate drive on a fresh install. It's only in Battlefront II that it happens, but for it to repeatedly happen across different hardware is absolutely something to notice.  Do you have any idea?",Negative
AMD,"Not sure if it's a ReLive thing, but I've always had all keyboard shortcuts off, all the overlay options off.

AMD,"Oh really? thats a good Info, glad i deinstalled that one and went back to the version before. i'm sure they will fix it, but when is the question :D",Positive
AMD,HW video encoding/decoding leads to driver timeout or even system crash. Had to disable hardware acceleration in browser to watch youtube etc. Applications such as Apple Music that use hardware acceleration but do not provide an option to disable it are thus unusable.,Negative

AMD,I mean if you experienced the bug that they just fixed in this driver then working “perfect” isn’t really all that perfect is it?  There’s been a lot of issues with virtual link which is probably why they gave up and magically fixed the vr issues at the same time.,Negative
AMD,Hopefully it fixes bf6 crashing that's a big issue rn,Negative
AMD,Unless you use specific DX12/Vulkan extension that is introduced by particular driver version ;),Neutral
AMD,Intel drivers are by no means better. They seem to be since they add performance in more titles (compared to Nvidia/AMD) but that's more due to them being terrible at first and Intel working to fix those issues.,Negative

AMD,"it just doesnt make sense. in basically all games with new apis they are neck and neck, but in games with older apis especially ones that are cpu heavy it seems to slow down. at least from all the research ive done it points to dx11 and its dependence on driver to be the cause. if you have a different thought id love to hear it.",Negative

I recommend running like prime95 stress test for at least an hour and it should come back with zero errors. If it comes back with any errors, that means any video driver issues you had, could have been caused by CPU/memory problems.  (Correction: I had one strange issue with Minecraft (Java) and Complementary Reimagined 5.5.1 shader, where \~5% of the time when I used a bed to sleep, I would get a driver timeout, but I assumed it was a bad combination of mods and the shader I was using.

AMD,They're definitely not backporting fsr 4 to rdna 2 at this point,Neutral
AMD,The USB-C port is the reason I bought a reference 7900 XT! I have a mini-ITX case with a handle and the USB-C port lets me do a quick one cable + power connection on any of my home desks or televisions. I now need to check if any of my unpowered hubs still work.,Positive
AMD,My 6950 doesn't feel old enough to be pushed out already.  Makes me seriously consider getting nvidia for my replacement with this type of crap.,Negative
AMD,Killing support for rdna2 this quick is criminal while nvidia is still supporting rtx 2000 series which is rdna1 counterpart... I am glad I got my 6800xt for barely 300$ from a gpu mining farm instead of buying at full price. Can't even imagine how I would feel,Negative
AMD,"the USB part is so baffling when you realize that the PSVR2 has an advantage on the reference cards due to requiring only one cable.   and WORSE still. its a catch 20/20 situation, this driver fixes a grave VR issue present for almost a year. but at the same time kills VirtualLink support.",Negative
AMD,"branching off RDNA2, a four year old gpu arch, while nvidia just got around to dropping pascal/maxwell, is...  not cool guys.",Negative
AMD,"This is some bs, they need to reverse this decision, AMD is getting a little too greedy, pulling stunts even nVidia haven't done yet,.

AMD,Man was gonna eventually upgrade to a 6000/7000 series card in the future from a 5700 xt. I fell like there’s no point now.,Negative
AMD,GTX1080 got like 9 years of support. 6800xt got 5years? Sorry amd this is my last card. Now with leaked unofficial support FSR4 that amd just decided not to implement. Im out boys,Negative
AMD,"Jesus christ.   GPUs like the 6800 XT are only 5 years old & being considered 'Legacy' & so thus getting degraded drivers. Meanwhile Turing GPUs from 2018 are still getting frequent full driver support (and so is the 11 year old GTX 980 for the time being). People wonder why people go for Nvidia for GPUs, but things like the official driver support are a very good reason why people go Nvidia, as they give frequent GPU drivers for older GPU series whilst AMD starts to kill them off after 5-6 years.",Negative
AMD,It's sad that amd often kills support or degrades the support faster than nvidia  I plan to upgrade my gpu soon ( my cpu upgrade is a 7800x3d already here ) but I will absolutely look more on the nvidia side.  6000 series isn't old yet and them already putting it on some weird 2nd branch isn't looking great.  I'd rather pay 50 or 100 more and don't have a badly supported gpu in a few years.,Negative

AMD,"Yeah...I have an RX 6950XT, thankfully did not pay anywhere near full price for it. If they're actually gutting driver support for a five year old architecture, one that is powering the current generation of consoles no less? My next card will not be AMD.   I would've begrudgingly accepted it had they done this in 2027-28. Wouldn't have been happy, but could've lived with it. This is just an atrociously short time frame, especially given how in recent UE5 games the RX 6950XT hangs around the RTX 5070 tier without heavy ray tracing.",Negative

AMD,"Very bad behaviour, now i'll think twice before buying a card that eventually will be dropped in a couple of years. Meanwile nvidia relased dlss4 even on 2018 hardware, at least this happened before i bought the 9070xt, i'd rather pay 100€ more for the competitor insted of buying a card that will eventually be abbandoned in less than 3 years.",Negative

AMD,This has been my biggest reservation about buying AMD based graphics cards. Historically they have been pretty quick about reducing or ending driver support. nVidia tends to support their cards for a ridiculously long time. My 8800GT and 980ti felt like they got drivers forever.,Negative
AMD,"This is one reason I stopped using AMD GPU's, after they dropped support for my HD 6950 only 5 years after release. I see they're doing it again with RNDA2.

You don't get support for new things quite as immediately, and if you're on a slower moving distro, you might not get it for a while. Stuff like FSR 4 took a couple extra months to work on Linux, for instance. Also, because the HDMI forum is...

AMD,It does make sense. AMD doesn't want you to use their cards for too long. They want you to upgrade every gen.,Neutral
AMD,"Oh, I see.

AMD,Companies 1000x smaller can still support products longer.  Yes. It is bullcrap and not reality.,Negative
AMD,"This is what the AMD Stans can't seem to understand. As someone who's used both Radeon and GeForce stuff, I can tell you... NVIDIA even when they remove support, they just get it right from the beginning. With GeForce you get 99% of the performance day 1. Rather than waiting months for the full performance of my card, NVIDIA gives it basically right away.  The whole FineWine argument makes no sense to me, these cards have a limited shelf life, if the first 6 months you're getting gimped performance, how is that a good thing? These cards are only relevant for maybe 24 months and their support is maybe 6 years of support if you're lucky with AMD and more like 8 years with NVIDIA. If I have to wait 4-6 months to get the full performance of my card, then any money you saved buying AMD is basically mute imo. The extra $50-100 is worth getting the full performance day 1 rather than waiting months for it. Especially if the issue is making the device completely unusable.   Then take into account black screen issues, game issues, multi-monitor power usage and inconsistent driver updates where like you said AMD may not ship a driver every month. I just never understood the FineWine thing... Now I will be fair and say NVIDIA's drivers honestly haven't been the best with Blackwell, but they've been just bad relative to how they were with Ampere, Pascal, Turing etc. They're still a lot better than AMD's worst driver moments the past couple of years and they're no where near Intel's driver problems for GFX. So NVIDIA is still the better choice in terms of driver support and I will give AMD credit, they held back RDNA4 to work on drivers more and it helped them a lot.  Either way, I'm tired of this duopoly and the GPU industry in general, too many people not willing to call out the BS from any of these companies and all of them are just screwing consumers. I honestly wished Intel was going to do better, but they've lagged for three generations now and they're looking like they'll abandon dGPU altogether.",Negative
AMD,I’ll gladly pay Nvidia $2000 for performance that laps everything else if it means I won’t need to worry about driver support being gone after a mere half decade. Nvidia JUST ended support for Pascal (as in they’re doing the same thing for a May 2016 GPU arch that AMD is now doing for a November 2020 arch).,Negative
AMD,"I'm also talking about stuff that happened almost 10 years ago.  But it is part of the reasons my friends and I have avoided AMD GPUs.  We had consistently had bad experiences with it, including driver related problems like this.

AMD,"Hopefully it's all a moot point and it works for OP anyway, due to needing less than 10 watts.  You're right though, I'm pretty sure there's inline power enhancement adapters for USB-C which would likely cost way less.",Positive
AMD,"Again, this is all on conjecture that's probably a moot point (7.2w should be easy even if PD is disabled), but probably because the adapter is hot garbage, at least so far as I've read/heard.  4K @ 120hz is a hard sell even under the best of circumstances, and being able to bypass any kind of active conversion in display/data pipes is definitely preferable.",Negative

AMD,"This + when the company isn’t a sole maintainer, they can’t just go and remove some stuff when they feel like it, because that will be contested by others.

AMD,Yep. I tried it for the first time on Outer Worlds 2 and it looks so much better I thought my brain was making shit up.,Positive
AMD,"Wait, that was the fix for plundervolt?!",Neutral
AMD,"It splits the signal, not conversion. Your GPU is doing the same thing over it's USB port.   They both maintain DP 1.4. One does it over USB-C DP alt and the other does it over a DP cable.   The VR2 adapter does what it should do, it's been reliable. The software was buggy in the beginning, but that wasn't exclusive to the adapter. What issues did you hear about?  The hub you linked requires thunderbolt host or USB4 for all the good features. It's an expensive path if you don't have a native port. Add in cards are pricey and didn't work well for me.

It backfires with tech-savy consumers though. I bought a Ryzen system specifically because AMD had an understandable naming convention at the time and Intel didn't.",Negative
AMD,"Ah, you are missing something really important here - what the actual customers want.  The customer for laptop chips is not the end consumer like you or I, but large laptop OEMs .  And those companies want regular rebadged names for the cheaper older chips, as they believe newer names equals more sales.  Hard to blame AMD for making their direct customers happy.    Note how for stuff that has more direct consumer sales like desktop chips they don't do the rebadge game (granted the desktop chips do have some questionable naming decisions, but the same chips keep the same name), likewise for the professional stuff.",Neutral
AMD,"There were SKUs that had a third and even a fourth digit in previous generations like the 5825U (mind you that is a Barcelo part, which was basically a small refresh of Cezanne). But AMD really popularized it and introduced it with the 7000 series to provide ""clarity"" as to what architecture something is. Why did they do that? Because in that same 5000 series lineup they had a mix of Zen2 and Zen3 parts. Like the 5300U which was Lucienne architecture, which was Zen2, but the 5800U was Zen3 Cezanne.  But it's just stupid because with the 6000 series, everything was Zen 3+, so whether you bought a 6800U or a 6600U it was all Zen3+. It didn't matter what you picked and tbh that's how they should have carried on, only make the new stuff the new generation naming.  In the 7000 series though they went back to the 5000 series naming sort of because they decided to mix old architectures again with the new stuff. For example, the 7735HS a Zen 3 chip and the 7745HX a Zen4 chip, that one third digit is supposed to notify you that you're buy Zen4, therefore it was as an indicator as to what Ryzen generation you were buying, but it just confused consumers even more because some people thought a 7640HS was worse than a 7735HS, but in single core the 7640HS beat the 7735HS and in multi-thread both were about even.  In the end, AMD made a shit solution to a shit solution, all of their own making and now they've come up with ANOTHER shit solution to try and ""fix it"".",Neutral

AMD,> it's previous generation silicon  Some of it is way worse than even that. There are _Zen 2_ chips (previous-previous-previous?) implicated here. That is some shamelessly re-badged garbage on AMD's part. These chips are barely even new enough to run Windows 11.,Negative
AMD,"No the real problem is they keep changing it every other generation. Maybe the new one makes more sense than the one before, but then again the one before that was even better. As a customer it is impossible for me to keep up, so the likelihood of me buying something expecting the latest CPUs and ending up with something from half a decade ago is disturbingly high. There is also no guarantee they won't change it again in a few years.",Negative
AMD,"For what it's worth, availability of the Athlon 7120U was **extremely** limited. I should know as I was trying to look for a laptop with that chip that didn't have 4GB of RAM with it, which effectively limited me to some really obscure HP slop box.   It doesn't make it excusable per se, but you'd have to stumble upon one of these completely at random or entirely intentionally to end up with one.",Negative
AMD,"The problem's that the moment these come onto the market isn't the moment every single older laptop gets wiped off the market, especially considering these are practically the same chips being re-released time and time again by AMD. Here's an example:  One customer looks at 5 budget laptops and their processors. #1 has a Ryzen 5 7520U, #2 has a Ryzen 3 7440U, #3 has a Ryzen 5 220, #4 has an older, discounted Ryzen 5 5600U, #5 has a Ryzen 5 40. Place your bets on the best one now.  Where do you even begin to compare these? Well, the Ryzen 5 7520U has a higher number than the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 5600U, so it should be better, right? Wrong. Both the 7520U and 7440U are 4-cores, 8-threads, but the Ryzen 5 7520U has a 15W TDP, 4MB of L3 cache, is Zen 2-based (from 2019), and has a Radeon 610M iGPU. Meanwhile, the 7440U has a 28W TDP, 8MB of L3 cache, is Zen 4-based (3 years newer), and has a Radeon 740M iGPU. It's going to be an order of magnitude faster than the chip that's a higher number than it. As for the Ryzen 5 5600U? It's a 6-core, 12-thread Zen 3 chip with a 15W TDP, 16MB of L3 cache, with a much inferior Vega 7 iGPU.  Okay... so the Ryzen 7520U is a no-go, and the Ryzen 7440U and Ryzen 5600U are kind of up for debate if you have a dGPU in these laptops (though absolutely pick the 7440U if the iGPU is the only form of graphics onboard). Well what's up with the Ryzen 5 40? What generation does that fall under? If the third digit of the 7000 series was architecture, and the first digit of the 5000 series was architecture, is the Ryzen 5 40... Zen 4 based? Well no, you're not supposed to know that, you're supposed to just believe it's a new chip. Well we know it's a Zen 2 4-core 8-thread with 4MB of L3 cache from the article, but this potential customer doesn't. They'll find it out if they research it, but by this point they're probably getting sick of researching CPUs when the vast majority of people know barely anything more than an Intel i7 or Ryzen 7 being good, and an RTX graphics also being good. They most likely don't know anything about cores, architectures, TDP, or L3 cache, and probably just want a working laptop.  What about the, uh, Ryzen 5 220? That seems... probably a fair bit worse than the Ryzen 3 7440U and Ryzen 5 5600U going off the name and potentially being connected in naming scheme to the Ryzen 5 40, so it's worse, right? Nope. The Ryzen 5 220 is a 6-core, 12-thread, Zen 4-based, 28W chip with 16MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 740M graphics. A clear choice to pick that gets the best of both worlds with regards to the cores & cache of the older chip, and the newer architecture and iGPU of the newer chip.  Outside of this hypothetical scenario now, I want to add an honourable mention to compare to the Ryzen 5 220. I'd like to bring up the Ryzen AI 5 330, which is a Zen 5-based 4-core 8-thread 28W chip with 8MB of L3 cache, and Radeon 820M graphics. It's got less cores and less L3 cache than the Ryzen 5 220 and most likely will be worse in benchmarks [(and as a matter of fact, it is)](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/6616vs6917/AMD-Ryzen-5-220-vs-AMD-Ryzen-AI-5-330), but despite this is a tier above (X20 v. X30) the 220, and very few will catch that the newer chip is worse than the older one. Even chips within this new naming scheme are inconsistent.  When these chips come out, the laptop market isn't going to have done away with the older chips for no good reason. [These chips are still out there](https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-ThinkPad-Notebook-Keyboard-Professional/dp/B0FT3CR5VK), and customers looking for an AMD chip are gonna regret looking for one if they have to compare this kind of shit. This naming scheme's only a year old with the Ryzen AI 300 series, and the previous one (where the architecture was defined by the third digit) lasted two generations from 2023 to 2024. Pre-2023 laptops are perfectly usable for the average person and they're still going to be selling those laptops today, and god help anyone looking for an AMD laptop that has to deal with this naming BS. Intel's not much better with their 200V series but at least it looks like they're going to stay the course and keep using that naming scheme now that desktop and mobile are somewhat unified. AMD's just drunkenly driving off a cliff with their mobile naming scheme and landing on another cliff they'll drive off on in a year or two. Meanwhile, their desktop chips are very easy to understand in comparison. No random digit amount switching, no sneaky third digit signifying architectures, or any of that nonsense. The Ryzen 5 9600 is faster than the Ryzen 5 7600. Easy.",Neutral
AMD,"> How is it confusing?   I'm so confused as hell. There's also a 9000 series on laptops? Also, aren't the 300 series the ones with AI? But if they make 100 series, do the 100 series have AI too? But hey there's a 8945HS and that has AI. So does the 9000 series for laptop have AI too? What's the latest too, is it the 300 series or the 9000 series?

AMD,"You can judge a CPU based on if it's a Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, or Ryzen 7, but that's not really a good idea beyond a generalization. A Ryzen 7 1800X is much worse than a Ryzen 5 7600. An Intel i7-870 is much worse than an Intel i3-12100.  Going past the obvious, a Ryzen 9 9900X is worse for gaming than a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and Ryzen 7 5700 is worse than a Ryzen 5 5600 (because the 5700 is a special chip - whereas usually chips like the 5600 are based off lower-clocked 5600Xs under the same architecture, the 5700 is based off the 5700G with PCIe 3.0 and much lower L3 cache. This continues with mobile hardware, from my comment above, with CPUs like the Ryzen 3 7440U and the Ryzen 5 7520U. One is two architectures newer, with double the L3 cache, double the TDP, with higher clocks, and a better iGPU. You'd think it to be the Ryzen 5 of the same ""generation"" (7000U) but it's not.  Desktop CPUs are easier (most of the time, there's still chips like the Ryzen 7 5700 though) but what I was saying up above is that AMD is making their laptop CPU naming schemes hard by switching them up every few generations, and it's almost certainly intentional to mislead consumers.",Negative

I’ve built 7950X3D and 9800X3D systems for my customers, and when I tested five games back then, their performance was very close to the results I got with the 14700K. I’ll be able to test more games in the future if another customer asks for an X3D build. I never claimed the 14700K was better than the X3D in general I only said it scored higher in one game, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and matched it in others. At first, I thought something was wrong with the build, so I made a post asking 4090 owners with X3D processors to benchmark HZD, and they confirmed my result. If I were to test 10 or 20 games, the 9800X3D might turn out to be about 5% faster, but I’m still not sure. Since I’m testing on 4090s, I can buy whatever processor I want, but based on the five games I tested, it doesn’t seem worth it. Also, the minimum frame rate was always a bit higher on the 14700K. X3Ds are generally good, but my main concern is that non-3D chips are 30–40% slower than the 14700K. Why does it feel like I’m the only one who knows this?  As for proof, I’ve provided built-in benchmark screenshots, phone-recorded videos (since OBS uses 15% of GPU resources), and OBS captures as well, which should give very close idea of processors performance. I’ve shown full system specs and game settings every time, and provided more evidence than any tech site or tech YouTuber ever has, yet some people are still in denial.

AMD,"Arrow Lake performs quite well at general compute and power efficiency compared to prior generatons ans even against AMD.  Where they have had trouble is in specifically gaming apps, particularly against the X3D variants (which it should be said drastically perform non-X3D AMD parts in gaming). And secondly that in improving power efficiency compared to 14th gen it appears they suffered in raw performance compared to high end power hungry parts like the 14900K.  This led to Intel being dismissed out of hand by gaming focused YouTube reviewers like HUB, GN and LTT despite them being perfectly capable parts outside of gaming, simply because they did not place well in gaming benchmarks in CPU limited scenarios (e. g. with a literal 5090).  HUBs own benchmarks, btw, show an utterly inconsequential difference between a 9700X part versus a 9800X3D part when paired with anything less than a 5080/4090 in gaming. Most people with most graphics cards wouldnt see the difference with their card between the various high end CPU parts unless theyre literally using a $1000+ GPU. Ironically the 9070 performance was identical with a 9700X and a 9800X3D.  So it's actually kind of the reverse, gaming reviewers painted Arrow Lake in the worst possible light.",Neutral

In a vacuum if AMD and intel launched their current lineup now they would both look pretty competitive. AMD zen5 was also a bit of a disappointment after all.

My other desktop is a ryzen 7900 (non x, 65 watt tdp)  Compiling my os takes 6 minutes on the 7900, 10 minutes on the 265k, 10 minutes on a 3950x, and 16 minutes on the 14700k.   That is not in windows, but my os which does not have thread director or custom scheduling for e cores. (So going to be worse than windows or Linux)   All the numbers except the 7900 are with the same ssd, psu, custom water loop.  The motherboard and cpu changed between Intel builds and the 3950x was the previous build before the 14700k.   The e core performance significantly improved in arrow lake.  It’s now keeping up with 16 core am4 parts in the worst possible scenario for it.  If the scheduler was smarter, I think it would be very close to the 7900.   In windows, it’s pretty close in games I play on frame rate to the old chip. A few are actually faster.",Neutral

AMD,The ones with similar pricing not performance,Neutral
AMD,"True, except AM5 supported all cpus 7000, 9000 and will support the newest one. So not exactly true per se, because you need a new motherboard every time and those on AM5 can upgrade cpu without buying a board. Imagine if someone was on 13400F and wanted to buy lets say 285K? Well, you need a new board. So it depends what “cheaper” is seen as.",Neutral
AMD,"Yep. We all see the patterns here. Gamers nexus, HUB, LTT and most big name they all keep mocking Intel, even when Intel did good job to bring improvements to their products like fixing Arrow Lake gaming performance but those ""tech reviewer"" decided to be blind, they don't even want to revisit Intel chip and benchmark it, they don't even want to educate their viewers.    At the same time they keep overhyping Amd products to the moon like they own the stock, it's obvious now who is the real reviewer and who is fraud reviewer using their own popularity and big headline to spread their propaganda for their own benefits.

AMD,"Platform longevity isn't stupid lol. There's a reason why am4 is one of the best selling and one of the best platforms of all time. The fact that you can go from a 1700x to a 5800x3d on the same mobo for 85% more performance is crazy good value. You can say that all you want but there's a reason why in the diy market everyone is buying amd over intel. People know arrow lake is doa where as am5 actually has a future, which is why everyone is flocking to the 9800x3d in droves.  Zen 7 is rumored to be on am5 as well. Meaning that am6 would come out in 2030/2031. If that's true am5 lived for around 8/9 years.  That's insane value to get out of one socket.",Positive

Most tend to skimp, only to end up buying another middling CPU the following year, and then again after that. And so the cycle trundles on.  When I buy PC parts, I usually go for the best available. Provided the price is reasonably sane. I picked up a 9900K seven years ago and it’s still holding its own. Is it on par with the 9800X3D? Of course not. But it’s still a very capable bit of kit. Next time I upgrade, I’ll go top shelf again.",Neutral

A good third party reviewer would be needed to determine by how much, yet it’s probably not worth their money and time to test it.   So the truth is probably in between what Intel is saying here and what the state of things was 6 months ago.",Negative

AMD,"u/musicmafia77 Based on what you're describing, this sounds like a classic case of Windows 11 being overly ""helpful"" with driver management. To get to the bottom of this and find a lasting solution, I'll need some specific details about your setup.   First, could you check Device Manager and tell me the exact model of your network adapter and current driver version? Since you mentioned you're using wired Ethernet, I'm curious if this is actually a Killer-branded Ethernet adapter. Also, when Killer inevitably returns, which specific processes are you seeing in Task Manager - things like ""Killer Control Center"" or ""Killer Network Service""?  Here's what's likely happening behind the scenes: Windows 11 maintains a driver store cache that can automatically reinstall what it considers ""preferred"" drivers, even after you've removed them. The system recognizes your Killer hardware ID and keeps pulling that branded driver through Windows Update, completely overriding your manual removal efforts. This explains why the KillerSoftwareUninstaller works temporarily but then everything reverts after a day or so.   To truly fix this, we'll probably need to perform a clean driver installation process that involves purging the entire driver store of Killer-related files, blocking Windows Update from auto-reinstalling them, and potentially replacing them with Dell provided drivers rather than Intel generic drivers (since Killer hardware is actually based on Intel chipsets).

Many lack encode/proper decode support, and they are effectively just 3D accelerators. The Intel Onboard Graphics would be a much better choice overall. Whereas an AMD APU would give you the full suite of features.   I'm not entirely worried for AMD. It just means if Intel and NVIDIA manage to not screw up onboard video, AMD will just need to make sure Radeon can remain competitive.

Anyone hoping to game on a laptop as their primary device will choose a model with an NVIDIA dGPU.   On handheld/console, AMD already has the largest market saturation, except for Switch, where Nintendo/NVIDIA opted for an ARM solution.  I don't see this APU being much more than a side choice that offers at best a reasonable alternative to a high end AMD APU, perhaps in the relatively small handheld market, if the performance is significantly better than existing AMD and Intel APUs, due to the DLSS support in a mobile form factor where a dGPU is not a realistic option, and upscaling is necessary for reasonable performance in a limited power package.

AMD,"It won’t affect either cause on parts that don’t need a nvidia igpu why raise the price with it when arc igpu is really good as is, maybe for the upper end they will have nvidia but what’s really stopping them from shipping one with an intel arc tile, gives customers more options and nvidia s Option may end up being more expensive",Neutral

AMD,Why would it?,Neutral
AMD,"It has nothing to do with the dgpu product stack. Nvidia makes very little from the diypc market. Way more comes from prebuilts, laptops and 90+% from data centers and other enterprise use. In a very real way, the arc cards are not a competitor to Nvidia.",Neutral
AMD,"Unfortunately no matter what given Intel's current state the division is going to suffer.

AMD,The market for Arc is the same as for Nvidia.,Neutral
AMD,Was that back in the MacBooks having the NVIDIA 9400m paired with a Core2Duo? Those were solid.,Positive
AMD,"No, but it is a reminder on shortcomings to watch out for. The Intel + AMD Partnership with the Intel NUCs several years ago made for some pretty compelling hardware. I still have a NUC8i7HVK in service which works like a champ.  If we are talking about current day NVIDIA with their Discrete Graphics (not the MX budget crap) then their GPUs are obviously smoking anything AMD and Intel. That doesn't resolve some of the Linux problems that still remain with NVIDIA, and that's not going to stop some of the BS NVIDIA does with their hardware around NVENC/NVDEC stream limits.

AMD,"Too many people are peeping that MLID podcast. Dude there is very confrontative about his theory that ARC is being ""effectively"" canceled because of some very early roadmap not paying out. Everything is a confirmation bias at this point.

AMD,"Arc was already not doing well long before. Pouring millions into their gpu division every year with no returns.

Of course I think they also had much rosier projections for their other ventures when they started this journey, so who knows if the GPU losses are still tolerable.",Neutral
AMD,Intel doesn't have a current gen A310 competitor either.,Neutral
AMD,Theres no way that nvidia is gonna let intel keep producing entry level gpus that directly compete with their own. I know their deals are in regards to apus and to compete with strix halo but nvidia is not gonna invest into a company with a competitor to their gpus.

AMD,IIRC that wss the AMD Turion X2 + NVIDIA 7300Go laptops. Those were notorious for dying.   I also remember some budget laptops with the Turion X2 + ATi 3200 chopsrt graphics would die due to graphics desoldering off the board. The GPU would sit at the end of the heatsink and burn up.   The 9400M MacBooks I remember would get hot enough to start leaving powder from the chassis on my desk lol.,Negative

AMD,"They're already at 2, going on 3, generations of losses though (Intel discrete GPU's basically have 0 marketshare, even worse than AMD who are also doing really badly) so even if that were true that isn't a reason to be optimistic.  As a company they also seem to be desperate to get income as well and so there is no reason to assume they're going to tolerate that situation for all that much longer.    I doubt they'll entirely kill off their GPU division, they can still do iGPU's which will be good enough and cheaper than paying NV a royalty, but the discrete GPU line is clearly in trouble.",Negative

Surface is notorious for being 3 or so quarters after CPU launch.  Look at where MTL is on this schedule, for example. Also around Q2, even though it had been on store shelves technically since the previous year's Q4.

AMD,"3D cache will eventually become full of assets and dip, if and onlyif IMC is bottlenecked by random memory access.  - the ability for cache to transfer data from memory, to IMC, to cache has a FPS hit (cache hit-rate). This is due to the bottleneck of a chiplet-based IOD: compromising memory latency with cache hit-rate. Eventually the cache fills and relying on IMC to feed the cores anyway.  You can easily test this by monitoring 1% lows and increasing memory latency (lowering DDR4 B-die clocks/DDR5 hynix and increasing timings) to see how Cache holds up when full of assets while memory is being bottlenecked-   What games need is 10-12 P-Cores and an IMC capable of high speeds. Within a monolithic die to reduce relying on cache hit-rate and IOD chiplet bottlenecks.",Neutral

AMD,The bad optimisation critics aremostly people trying to sound smart by rambling things they dont understand.  Game engines are very optimized these days.   Its funny they mostly pick on Unreal Engine 5 as the prime example... That is probably the most complete game engine out there. So naturally its hard to make all that stuff work well togetter...

AMD,Mixed cores are awesome if the scheduler would do what i want and there lies the problem and i dont think even AI can solve that yet.,Negative
AMD,"I said IPC of Zen 4 is the SAME and weaker than Zen 4 is weaker than Skymont in IPC. No more no less. As for clocks, the core scales to max 5.2ghz (default 4.6ghz), certainly overall slower than Zen 4. IPC is a comparison about throughput at a given clockspeed. Its a give to compare you will need to match the clocks.  Funny you you should mention latencies, considering that core to core (even accross clusters), latencies of Skymont are better than Lion Cove? So if latency is the issue, it has nothing to do with Skymont and everything to do with the trash uncore they have based on the Meteorlake SOC. Even workstation Crestmont on a different package performs better. Furthermore skymont IPC is measured based on Arrowlake. Arrowlake is worse latency than Raptorlake and Zen already. Latencies have been accounted for.",Negative

AMD,"Regarding the cache optimizations you pointed out, I have a question. Can you test all APO supported games you own and capture the utilization of the E-cores ?  My understanding is that Intel is keeping 1 E-core per cluster active and parking the remaining 3 E-cores. So the lone E-core of each cluster has full access to the 4mb shared L2. For the i9 they can have 4 such solitary E-cores that have their own cache and hence do not touch the L3 cache. The 4 E-cores handle background task while the 8 P-cores with the full 36mb L3 cache deal with the games.  Please correct me if I am wrong.  Also, what cpu cooler do you use ?",Neutral

AMD,Balanced in full load will just do the same thing as High Performance.,Neutral
AMD,"It's capable of a few things, but the main mechanism from what I've seen is that it temporarily disables three out of four cores in each E-core cluster by forcing them into the lowest power state. The result is that the remaining active core has access to each cluster's full L2 cache (2MB on 12th-gen, 4MB on 13th/14th-gen). L2 cache isn't shared with P-cores (L3 is global), so this can really minimize E-core cache evictions before they're forced into slower memory, and games do love themselves some cache.  It's a genuinely clever way of maximizing available resources and I really wish they'd allow user control over its features, but it seems to be pretty tightly leashed to/by the team that developed it. It obviously wouldn't benefit every situation, such as particularly low/high thread occupancy situations, but it's pretty rough to have the option tied to quarterly updates for one or two specific games.",Neutral

AMD,They are they came up with ML for their upscaller before the red team did and even better than FSR as a dump upscaler and they also did a good RT implementation. But the hardware still has raw horse power issues and they already use a big die for what it can do.  In the 80's or they shammed The DEC Alpha team on subnormal floating point operations with the 8087 FPU. Intel was doing way more precession without having to round so earlier on a consumer FPU while the Alpha CPU was a Mainframe one. Intel also gave it up to help estandardize the way CPUs handle floating point types.  Intel compilers were also black magic becuase they optimized so much C and C++ for Intel specifically but there was always controversy causeless AMD x86 couldn't take part of those optimizations,Neutral
AMD,Were there any background tasks running when the screenshot was captured ? I want to see how the E-cores are assigned for the background tasks under APO.,Neutral
AMD,In certain games. It's not universal at all. There would be scenarios where it gets an edge but if AMD is pushing as hard as rumors state they may still have the better CPUs overall.,Neutral
AMD,"Great explanation that makes sense!  It definitely has to do with the cache, that much is true.

AMD,"Actually, it is better than X3D in almost every GPU/CPU combo where the GPU throttles. Intel 14th gen almost universally wins 1% lows and frequently FPS - almost universally in 4k gaming, but as I said, when the GPU throttles at any resolution, which is almost always, Intel wins.",Positive
AMD,"Eh, they're very good but they benefited vastly from AMDs mistakes and the lessons learned from it. Remember AMD didn't have any ai hardware for their first 2 gens on RDNA and RDNA 3 didn't have enough for FSR4 either. It's not that intel were better at producing a ML upscaler. They just had the hardware for it from the get go so they could implement it quicker.  They did make Xess though which is miles ahead of FSR 3 even on AMD systems (on average.

AMD,"You are massively oversimplifying. A lot of games that support APO, like Metro Exodus EE OP used as an example, were released before Intel released CPUs with P and E cores. Expecting studios to rework and optimize old games for new CPUs is very naive.",Negative
AMD,"They should be focusing on optimizations that help the vast majority of all CPUs, especially older/lower end ones.   It's not their job to specifically help one companies latest CPU architectures because they couldn't figure out how to create a core that has both good area and performance.",Negative

AMD,"According to Intel, the app is entirely optional. The DTT driver already includes APO, the app is just an interface to control it and disable APO, if needed.",Neutral
AMD,Thanks a lot.,Positive
AMD,> i am not talking about older games. i am talking about newer games.... really dude?  New games seldom have problems with P and E cores. That is why if you took at minute to look at games that APO support you would notice almost all were released before 2022 before release of Alder lake CPUs. Because older P and E unaware games struggle. Don't really dude me if you are this clueless.,Negative
AMD,"APO includes specific optimizations made for specific Intel skus, not general optimizations that help pretty much all processors.",Neutral
AMD,That is not true whatsoever. Games do not properly utilize the p and e cores and unreal 5 is very known for this.,Negative
AMD,Ok…? If there is a specific problem then they need to optimize it for that hardware. Literally a devs job. Still don’t get your thought process,Negative
AMD,"Dude, Unreal 5 runs like crap on pretty much all hardware. It stutters on AMD and nVidia graphics. Unreal 5 doesn't count.",Negative
AMD,"There isn't a specific problem, it still works lol, just not as well as it could on a specific architecture.   They shouldn't be wasting their finite resources/time on optimizing specifically for an already relatively high end and well performing architecture, but rather attempting more generalized optimizations that help all users.   It really shouldn't be too hard to understand.",Neutral
AMD,"Very cool. Cheers Intel! As a 6900XT owner, I use Xess whenever it's available. The DP4A version got very solid once V1.3 hit.  Hopefully more devs implement it.",Positive
AMD,"I like how Intel still support DP4A model. My meteor lake chip gonna love this XeSS2 with FG and LL.  Meanwhile Amd give middle finger to their consumer who don't have radeon 9000 series, FSR4 doesn't works at all on their previous GPU including the flagship rx 7000 series.",Positive
AMD,Did the DP4A version also improve from 1.3 to 2.0?,Neutral
AMD,"I thought it was a mix of both shader model 6.4+ and DP4a, not either or",Neutral
AMD,Okay but why would I want to use that instead of NVIDIA DLSS?,Neutral
AMD,It’s the least you should get after not getting FSR4.,Negative
AMD,You'd use it over FSR if that's available too?,Neutral

AMD,"I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4.   On Linux they managed to emulate it using the FP16 instruction, which is available on RDNA3, but it seriously impacts performance and introduces 1,5ms of input latency, compared to the 0,5/0,8ms of latency on RDNA4 with hardware FP8.",Negative
AMD,And they expect people who bought previous RDNA to buy more RDNA,Neutral
AMD,Not by a significant amount.,Neutral
AMD,DP4a only relevant for intel igpus as its crpss vendor locked by intel. Other gpus only get the Shader Model 6.4 version.,Neutral

AMD,"I mean it gives better image quality than FSR 3.1, so I know I definitely do.",Positive
AMD,Sure. The image quality is generally better. I'd only use FSR if I was trying to squeeze every last drop of performance out of my GPU since it's faster than Xess DP4a. But Xess will be tried first.,Positive
AMD,Do you have a link? Anything I have seen points to the GPU using Xess DP4A unless it's an ARC GPU. So it supports RDNA2 and newer on AMD and Turing and newer on Nvidia.  https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xess-compatibility-nvidia-amd/  And I do literally run Xess on my 6900XT (currently using it for F7 Rebirth through Optiscaler). So if I'm not running Xess DP4a then what am I running?,Neutral
AMD,">I don't want to defend AMD, but 7000 series lacks the FP8 instruction to hardware accelerate FSR4   Sure, but they can make FSR4 for non hardware accelerated like Intel right?

AMD,"Amd really all in when it comes to copying Nvidia. Guess what? The more you buy, the more you save!",Neutral
AMD,DP4a is cross vendor.   XMX is Arc only.,Neutral

The article you linked is from 2021, in early 2022 intel cross vendor locked DP4a. The main article of the post clearly states Shader Model 6.4.",Neutral
AMD,where did amd touch you bud?,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah more and more games are adding DLSS support, so I'm not sure when I would need Xess",Neutral
AMD,"That's true but in edge cases where even the lightest Xess option is still too heavy, FSR may still deliver a better overall experience.   E.g. CP2077 on the steam Deck in Dog Town. When I was testing some stuff out (trying to see how close I could get my Deck to the Switch 2 build) I found Xess to be a unsuitable. Even on the lightest Xess mode, the performance hit was a bit too noticeable. FSR doesn't look as good as Xess but it runs better and you can get away with a bit more upscaling artifacting on the Decks relatively small screen. Just rendering at a lower res and letting the screen upscale was also a solid option in that scenario.  As I say though, that's an edge case where you really just need outright speed. If your GPU doesn't support DLSS or FSR4 then using Xess makes sense in the vast majority of cases.",Neutral
AMD,Are you sure you're not getting the DP4A/Shader Model 6.4 and Arc exclusive version mixed up? DP4a was added to Shader Model 6.4. https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki/Shader-Model-6.4.  There is a separate path of Xess that is better than DP4A but that only works on Arc Cards.,Neutral
AMD,"It's good to see finally Intel working with game developer to bring optimization to Intel platform. This time not only optimization for Arc GPU, but also for Intel Core CPU like proper CPU scheduling for P and E cores to make sure the game runs on the right thread.  I think this also the reason why they never update APO game support again. Obviously optimizing their platform by working directly with game developer is better than doing it by themself.

AMD,"It's not like game runs bad on Intel CPU which has P and E cores, i will be lying if i say that. It's about maximizing CPU performance. CPU demanding game will runs with much higher FPS when it knows which thread should be utilized.    This is why game with APO enable like R6S on i9-14900K at 1080p low settings, it got performance increase up to 100FPS which is massive.",Neutral
AMD,"Most games are optimized for consoles which are natively eight cores, and a lot are ported over to PC and so you basically need eight fast cores in whatever CPU you happen to have, and the rest don't really do much. That's why Intel HEDT and AMD's Threadripper aren't of much use in this regard.",Neutral
AMD,"No, that's because and isn't really better for gaming unless you get their x3d variants. Those have a different style of memory that is better for gaming in particular but can underperform when it comes to workload tasks. Idk why 🤷",Negative

AMD,If latency slightly increases or stays the same due to adopting Pantherlake optimizations and the newer Foveros then that might be enough to narrow the gap,Neutral

AMD,Most likely the bLLC variant wil be single compute tile and single cache tile as this would be cheaper for now than putting bLLC cache in base tile like Amd did. They can do that when 18A-PT is avaliable which will probably be after Nova Lake goes into production with 18A or maybe 18A-P,Neutral

AMD,"Yes, but in games, it's the P-cores that are meant to be utilized. Also, more than eight cores or 16 threads aren't really necessary for gaming. The 9950x3d isn't faster, than the 9900x3d.  My point is that the space taken up by the E-cores could instead be used for additional cache, not?",Neutral
AMD,I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it. Anyhow if that's true the large L3 should be even more helpful for things like gaming as it will keep those higher latency hits down.

AMD,Process lasso can let you just designate by task so the E cores can do background and side jobs. People use process lasso on the 7950x3d to make the X3D chiplet run games with those 8 cores and the other 8 core chiplet for everything else.,Neutral
AMD,What issue did you run into with a 9800x3d? It has one CCD and no small cores,Neutral
AMD,"Nowadays there are very few cases where disabling E cores is extremely beneficial, sometimes they are a detriment to performance but more often than not they are useful. Not to mention the E core design team is more competent than the P core team and are quickly catching up in performance.    The E cores in Alder Lake had relatively poor ST performance but in Arrow Lake they are much faster and closer to the P cores in raw performance. Every new generation the gap keeps shrinking and it will make the disabling of E cores less and less relevant.    Sometimes the Windows scheduler will wrongly assign an E core to a ST bound task, even if a P core is available, but it doesn't happen often enough to be a serious issue.",Neutral
AMD,"yes, but not because of windows scheduling - its because you can OC higher with them off - better temps and easier stability - some people disable HT for the same.",Neutral
AMD,They don't pay attention,Negative
AMD,"No. Intel needs to do what Amd did and add seperate bLLC just for gaming. As long as latency is reduced to the L3 cache including bLLC, gaming performance will definitely increase as 285K and 9950x have similar performance in both gaming and productivity with small lead going to Amd. But x3d totally dominates ARL beacsue of the obvious huge cache difference and lower overall latency to their cache implementation.",Neutral

AMD,">I had heard this both ways and never really know who to trust until I see it.  I'm curious, which leakers have said otherwise?   You could still have mem latency improvements without the mem controller being on the compute tile too, so the situation there can improve either way.   >AMD has always had higher latency due to the same kind of design with a separate memory controller so we have pretty good data on how extra cache can help  Yup, and ARL has higher mem latency than AMD even, so obviously there is room to improve even without having to move the mem controller back.",Neutral

Also, if AMD wants to pay for TSMC N2 capacity, TSMC will build it out. Just a couple days ago we had a [report](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250724PD213/tsmc-2nm-capacity-2028-3nm.html) about TSMC being very aggressive with N2 scale out, and the reasoning here is two fold- first of all, 2026 is technically the 2nd year of N2 HVM, and also because a *lot* of major SOCs, other than just Apple and AMD, will be on N2- demand for N2 is high, and build out will be too.",Neutral

AMD,"Yes but IF Intel decides to do quad channel for AI nonsense at least for flagship model, Amd threadripper will be stomped over as I will definitely buy the Nova Lake part just for the price/performance compared to 9960x threadripper. The motherboard selection alone for Z890 is absolutely amazing and RDIMM prices aretwice as expensive for the same amount of memory. I expect with CAMM2 that max ram capaciity will go for 512GB and maybe 1TB for Nova Lake aswell. Even with 2 channel, cudimm will go above 10,000 MTS and maybe 12000 if we are lucky on CAMM2 modules by 2027 as CAMM2 definitely being used for DDR6   I do feel Intel has I/O advantage beyong gaming and that market is getting bigger than hardcore gamers all the time!!

AMD,"I don't recall Intel stating that NVL core chips would be at TSMC, only that some of the eventual package would be... which implies iGPU, to me, and that wouldn't be N2 (possibly N4, since Battlemage is N5, and N4 would be open and cheaper than N3 nodes).  Do you have a source, where they directly claim the NVL cores are coming from TSMC?",Neutral
AMD,"The game is a dumpster fire when it comes to CPU utilization, it hammers even top tier gaming chips like the 9800X3D. I'm not surprised if the E cores can bottleneck the performance even further, most likely some of the game's heaviest threads get (wrongly) assigned to the E cores.    The scheduling in W11 has been significantly improved over the last few years but it's not 100% perfect either. Legacy software in particular, which typically utilizes 1 core, often ends up running in an E core and as a result you can't take advantage of the higher ST performance a P core provides.

AMD,"Wonder what node such a product, if it does exist, would use for the iGPU tile.   AFAIK, rumor is that the iGPU tile for the standard parts would be on 18A or an 18A variant. However, if this is a flagship part, I would assume they would be willing to pay the extra cost to use N2...   However that would also presumably involve porting the architecture over to another node, which I don't think Intel has the resources, or wants to go through the effort, to do so.   Also wonder if such a product will finally utilize the ADM cache that has been rumored since like, forever.   And this is a bit of a tangent, but I swear at this point in the leak cycle for a new Intel product, there's always usually a ton of different skus that are leaked that may or may not launch - right now we have NVL bLLC, NVL standard, and now this, and a bunch of them end up not launching (whether they were cut internally, or the leaks were just made up). So it would be pretty interesting to see if any of the more specialized rumored NVL skus end up actually launching.",Neutral

AMD,"The low volume part of that quote is important. If you're making heaps of them, each can take up a little bit of the startup costs for that design. If you only make a few, those costs get concentrated on what you do make.  Low volume also means a single defect is promotionally more of your possible units, and hits the margins harder. You do get more total defects in a larger run, but at sufficiently high quantities of those defects, you start making lower bins to recover some of the defects. If you hardly make the volume to cover one widespread SKU, you aren't likely to have enough to make a cheaper one with any degree of availability. At some point you hit a threshold where it's not worth selling what would be a lower bin because there's not enough of them.",Neutral

AMD,"Even though it's not stacked, I believe it's still going to fix the last level cache latency issue MTL and ARL have.   Ryzen CPUs have lower L3 latency than Intel because each CCX gets their own independent L3, unlike Intel's shared L3. Now in NVL, the BLLC configuration will replace half of the P-core and E-core tiles with L3, so possibly giving the existing cores/tiles their own independent L3, improving latency and bandwidth over shared L3.  But one thing intrigues me. If this cache level has lower latency than shared L3, wouldn't this more properly be called L2.5 or something below L3 rather than last level cache? Will NVL even still have shared L3 like the previous Intel CPUs? I know the rumor that it will have shared L2 per two cores, but we know nothing of the L3 configuration.",Neutral

His monitor runs at 240Hz, and the cursor moves very smoothly, but dragging a window around felt like it was refreshing at 60Hz. Launching League of Legends would take upwards of 10+ seconds, and loading the actual game would briefly drop his FPS to the low 20s before going back to normal. Waking the system from sleep had a noticeable 2-3 seconds delay before the (wired) keyboard would respond, which is strange, considering the keyboard input was what wake the system up in the first place.  Apparently, some of these things also happen to him on his old 5800X3D system, and he thoughts that these little quirks were normal.  I did my due diligence on his AMD setup: updated the BIOS and chipset drivers, enabled EXPO profile, made sure Game Bar was enabled, set the power mode to Balanced.

AMD,"Now both AMD and Intel chips are “disaggregated “ which means between cpu and other agents like memory controllers, pcie, and storage there is higher latency than the 12/13/14th gen parts. AMD has higher latency due to the larger distances involved on the package.  Also Intel is not really improving the CPU core much. There won’t be a compelling reason to upgrade from a 14700 until DDR6 comes out. At least not in desktop. Nova lake high cache parts will cost $600 or more so value/dollar will be low.",Negative

AMD,"As a long time AMD user I know that Intel needs to be tuned to perform best. So when you tune the 14900K or even 285K you get like 20% performance uplift vs stock. X3D just performs great out of the box because of the huge L3 Cache. At the very least if you do not like microstutters or frame drops and want consistent gaming performance Intel 14th gen is superior vs current AMD's offering. Anyone with a specific board like Apex, Lightning, Tachyon, or even Gigabyte Refresh boards + i7/i9 13-14th gen with decent memory controller can achieve similar gaming experience.

AMD,"That channel has a lot of videos and even on this specific video it would help if you point the specific time you're referring to.  Now regarding AI, I assume you are talking about token generation speed and not prompt processing or training (for which Macs are lagging due to weak GPU compute).  I happen to have expertise in optimizing AI algorithms (see https://www.reddit.com/user/Karyo_Ten/comments/1jin6g5/memorybound_vs_computebound_deep_learning_llms/ )  The short answer is that consumers' PCs have been stuck with dual-channel RAM for very very long and with DDR5 the memory bandwidth is just 80GB/s to 100GB/s with overclocked memory.  Weakest M4 starts at 250GB/s or so and M4 Pro 400GB/s and M4 Max 540GB/s.  Slowest GPUs have 250GB/s, midrange about 800GB/s and 3090~4090 have 1000~1100GB/s with 5090 having 1800GB/s bandwidth. Laptop GPUs probably have 500~800GB/s bandwidth  LLMs token generation scales linearly with memory bandwidth, compute doesn't matter on any CPU/GPU from the past 5 years.  So by virtue of their fast memory Macs are easily 3x to 8x faster than PC on LLMs.  The rest is quite different though which is why what benchmark is important.",Neutral

I'm a dev, I want my code to be the fastest on all platforms  I have: - M4 Max so I can optimize on ARM and MacOS - Ryzen 9950X so I can optimize with AVX512 - in the process of buying an Intel 265K so I can tune multithreaded code to heterogeneous architecture.  The problem of Intel and AMD is segmentation between consumer and pro.  If Intel and AMD want to be competitive on AI they need 8-channel DDR5 (for 350~400GB/s), except that it's either professional realm (Threadripper's are 8-channel and EPYC's are 12-channel) with $800~1000 motherboards and $1500 CPUs and $1000 of RAM.  Or they make custom designsvwith soldered LPDDR5 like the current Ryzen AI Max 395, but it's still a paltry 256GB/s.  Now consumer _need_ fast memory. Those NPUs are worthless if the data doesn't get fetched fast enough. So I expect the next-gen CPUs (Zen 6 and Nova Lake) to be quad-channel by default (~200GB/s with DDR5) so they are at least in the same ballpark as M4 chip (but still 2x slower than M4 Pro and Max).  I also expect more soldered LPDDR5 builds in the coming year.",Neutral

AMD,"The RMA process for Intel is absolutely atrocious. I don't know if  anyone can give advice on this but here is what is happening:  Based in Germany, for geolocation info. I was one of the early adopters of the 13th gen processors, but as I don't follow tech news too strongly I didn't find out about the issues with these chips until autumn 2024 when the issues I was having with my PC escalated to a point I couldn't ignore any further. Identified the CPU as the likely culprit and started the RMA process.  Firstly, Intel would not offer any solution where I could continue to use my PC whilst they analysed my CPU. As I use my PC for work, having it out of action for weeks/months was simply not an option, so I was forced to pause the RMA ticket whilst I saved up for a new cpu way ahead of my expected timeline.  With that aside, I reopened my ticket and the requirements they lay out are near impossible to meet - they wanted a clear photo of the matrix on the front of the chip and the matrix on the pcb itself.  The front of the chip was simple enough but on this series Intel printed the matrix in dark grey on a dark green pcb. It's barely visible just with the naked eye and I've tried so many ways to take a picture of the matrix with my smartphone and nothing I do is getting a clear picture.  I don't understand how your average consumer can possibly meet this requirement - solutions online apparently suggest purchasing a special type of expensive scanner or a macro lens for your smart phone? Which is ridiculous to me.  There is no way they cannot verify my chip with the rest of the information I have been able to give them, as well as far as I am aware, the matrix on the side of the chip on the 13th gen is literally the same as the one on the front of the chip.

AMD,"u/ken10wil  Thanks for the detailed info - this is really helpful for narrowing things down. What I'm seeing here points to a software issue rather than hardware failure. The sudden onset timeline, passing PDT tests, and the fact that safe mode works fine all suggest you're dealing with a software or driver problem.   Your CPU temps are totally normal too, so I can rule out thermal throttling. That 15% CPU usage spike right before throttling kicks in is actually a big clue - something's definitely triggering this behavior.

Furthermore, the way the motherboard is set up also impacts the overclocking ability of a particular system (such as liquid cooler vs fan). Please note that if the system was overclocked, including voltage/frequency beyond the processor supported specifications, your processor voids warranty.   **Next steps to try:** • **Check Windows power settings** \- sometimes updates mess with power profiles. Set to ""High Performance"" and see if that helps •   **Look at that 15% CPU spike** \- open Task Manager right after boot and sort by CPU usage to catch what's eating those cycles •   **Try disabling Windows security temporarily** \- sometimes antivirus can cause weird throttling behavior •   **Check Event Viewer** \- look for any error messages around the time throttling starts • **Check Reliability Monitor** \- go to Control Panel > Security and Maintenance > Reliability Monitor to spot any anomaly issues or critical events around August 19-20thThe fact that overclocking fixes it temporarily suggests your CPU is being artificially limited by software, not hardware.

While VROC is no longer actively developed, it remains supported in sustaining mode for existing users, which means NVMe drives that were released during VROC's active development period (roughly 2017-2022) should still function properly.

AMD,"u/Hippieman100 Ah, I see I overlooked that part! Looks like this is the installer version, my apologies for the confusion since we were discussing three different software options earlier.  Alrighty, since you're using the latest version now, how can I help? Are you running into any issues with the new application, or is there a specific feature that's not working as expected?",Neutral
AMD,"u/TheCupaCupa Great to hear it fixed itself! If it happens again, trying Turbo off sounds like a good plan.",Positive
AMD,"u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  You're encountering a common issue, Intel doesn't maintain a centralized QVL (Qualified Vendor List) specifically for X299 VROC at the platform level. Since X299 is a consumer chipset, the VROC compatibility lists were typically maintained by individual motherboard manufacturers rather than Intel directly. The C621 QVL you found is for Intel's server/workstation chipset, which has more formal validation processes. For X299 VROC compatibility, you'll need to check with your specific motherboard manufacturer (ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, etc.) as they would have maintained their own compatibility lists during VROC's active period. However, since X299 VROC is now in sustaining mode, many manufacturers may no longer actively update these lists. Your best bet is to search for your specific motherboard model's support page or contact the manufacturer directly, though given the discontinued status, this information may be limited or archived.",Neutral
AMD,Relax 😅 and follow this:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005609/processors.html,Neutral
AMD,"Yeah switching fonts, I haven't tried it. But in windows settings you can change its size and such. Try looking at the Microsoft community or support changing it. But I am glad that adjusting the gamma helps.",Neutral
AMD,u/Tagracat  Kindly follow the article linked below to request a warranty replacement. You can use this Reddit thread as a reference for faster processing.  [How To Submit an Online Warranty Request](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000098501/programs.html),Neutral
AMD,"Thank you for the reply. Sadly asrock doesn’t have a QVL for nvme drives in U.2 form factor or enterprise grade drives, just m.2. Let alone a QVL for VROC support. Looks like I’ll be the test subject for this.",Negative
AMD,"That is what I'm following, I provided support everything on that list, including decoding the matrix on the front of the chip but they don't proceed with the ticket until they get a picture of the code on the pcb which is nigh on impossible.  I wound up taking it into the office to use a high resolution scanner thats used to digitise paintings and just about got something readable. I remain firm in my stance that whilst wanting to verify a serial number isn't outrageous, making the process in which you verify said information virtually impossible is.   I simply don't understand how regular people can take such a detailed photo using smartphone technology. My phone is 4 years old and was absolutely not capable (Samsung S20+)",Negative
AMD,u/PM_pics_of_your_roof  **Best of luck with your configuration!** Your pioneering work might just pave the way for others looking to implement similar setups.,Positive
AMD,"u/Danderlyon  **just sent you a message, check your inbox when you get a chance!**",Neutral
AMD,"Just wanted to follow up for anyone seeing this or is in a similar boat. I can confirm that Intel DC P4510 drives will work in a VROC Raid using a standard key.      Not sure if intel support can confirm but it appears the ASROCK X299 Taichi CLX supports VROC Raid across multiple VMD Domains, which is supposed to be locked behind Xeon scalable CPU/Chipsets. I need to buy two more drives and try to add them to my array to confirm.",Neutral
